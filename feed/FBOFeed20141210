<DESC>The Government currently has Digital Fuel Quantity Intermediate Devices (DFQIDs) for use on the A-10C aircraft. Testing revealed failure of the DFQID when exposed to precipitation and/or high humidity environments. It was also determined that inadequate testing was conducted during the manufacture of the DFQID for the environment (unprotected) that it will be used in. The units were found to be insufficiently sealed and became unstable after exposure to precipitation and/or high humidity.
<p>Purpose of this contract is to have the Contractor upgrade, test, and deliver four provided DFQIDs, including updated drawings and technical data. This includes improving the maintenance access cover seal, base plate seal, and the electrical connectors/MIL-STD-1553 gasket seal. Upon delivery, these four DFQIDs will be flight ready for follow-on Government developmental testing and evaluation (DT&amp;E).</p>

<a href="mailto:ACDC@darpa.mil">ACDC@darpa.mil</a>
<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals to develop prototype systems for agnostic conversion of chemical warfare agents to inert material. Destroying bulk stores of Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs) and their organic precursors abroad is a significant challenge for the international community. Current approaches such as hydrolysis, incineration and supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) to process CWAs and precursor chemicals have a number of shortcomings: 1) they are not truly agnostic due to limitations with the chemistry and/or materials of construction; 2) due to their large size, they require transport of the agent from the storage site to the neutralization site;  and 3) approaches such as hydrolysis and SCWO require consumables (e.g., water), which must be supplied locally and produce significant amounts of hazardous waste that require further processing.  In the Agnostic Compact Demilitarization of Chemical Agents (ACDC) program, DARPA will develop new technologies to address these shortcomings. The overarching objective of ACDC is to realize a transportable, agnostic prototype system that converts =99.9999% of any halogenated or non-halogenated organic compound into constitutive oxides (e.g., SOx, POx, NOx) and stable alkaline or alkaline earth metal salts (or another demonstrated safe form) with minimal consumables and no hazardous waste output.

<DESC>Scope of Work for HRSG #2 Initial Work Request

Given the results of the hydrostatic test performed on HRSG #2, or lack thereof with the amount of leaking, NAVFAC UEM is issuing a work request to replace all leaking tubes within the unit and restore it to full functionality.  Based upon previous repair work this would require at most a total of twenty (20) leaking/access tubes being removed and replaced.  Upon removal of known leaking tubes after each hydrostatic test, it is recommended that said tubes be plugged and an additional hydrostatic test administered to determine if there are any other leaks until all the leaking tubes have been eliminated.

The Government physically does not have in its possession sufficient,accurate, or legible data to purchase this part from other than the current source(s). The
subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the
item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the

<SOLNBR>SOL-CI-15-00010
<RESPDATE>122914
<ARCHDATE>01292015
<CONTACT>Angela Lower

<a href="mailto:Lower.Angela@epa.gov">Lower.Angela@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. EPA, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) located in Ann Arbor, Michigan intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with AVL North America Test Systems, Inc. (AVL) in order to provide preventative and remedial maintenance, spare parts and upgrade services to AVL-supplied vehicle and engine emission test equipment and associated components owned by EPA under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  This requirement will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
AVL equipment is controlled by AVL proprietary software.  The analytical benches are controlled by AVL iGEM software.  High-level maintenance, repairs, and upgrades require access to the source code of the proprietary software above.  The systems are configured, hard-wired, rigidly plumbed and proprietarily programmed to accept AVL replacement parts.  The AVL replacement parts come with factory settings specified to meet specific AVL applications.  The Engine Test Center (ETC) has an AVL CVS system which requires specially trained AVL staff to maintain and calibrate.  ETC also has several AVL Fuel Systems that require annual maintenance and calibration by specially trained AVL staff.  The Testing Services Group operates the HTF (Hot Test Facility). This site consists of one raw and one dilute gas analyzer bench. An Innova bench, CVS (constant volume sampler), PSS (particulate sampling system), heated tunnel associated software and gas divider. All require annual maintenance t o perform at standards set in the CFR. This contract will perform this maintenance once each year downing the bench when the need is low, reducing down time during critical use periods and improving reliability. Due to the proprietary nature of both the testing equipment and software that comprise the system AVL North America is the only contractor that is able to supply parts and software with the ability to do this work. AVL builds and writes the software for this system.  Furthermore, AVL will only extend warranty to work performed by AVL service technicians, with AVL spare parts.
AVL is the only known source able to satisfy the preventive and remedial maintenance requirements, spare parts and upgrades for the AVL-supplied equipment owned by EPA.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing preventive and remedial maintenance services of AVL equipment may submit technical documentation to establish their capability.  Such documentation must be submitted to the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Angela Lower through FedConnect Message Center.  Telephone responses will not be  honored.

<DESC>This announcement is a Sources Sought (SS)/Request for Information (RFI) for market research.  Information is to be used for preliminary planning purposes in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future.  No solicitation is available nor is there an estimated date of solicitation release at this time.  This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein.  If this office chooses to issue an RFP at some future date, another notice will be published. <br>  <br>  The Product Manager Air Warrior (PM AW) is seeking information and sources with a qualified system capable of providing head tracking as part of a Helmet Display and Tracking System.  The HDTS must interface with the current configuration of the Advanced Sight and Display Computer (ASDC) and Common Display Interface Unit (CDIU).  The Government does not possess a verified and validated Technical Data Package for the Advanced Sight and Display Computer (ASDC) or Common Display Interface Unit (CDIU) as each contains proprietary data the Government is not privy to.  Any responses to this RFI will be used to gather information on systems that may be able to fulfill the PM AW's needs.  <br> Background:  PM AW is installing the Advanced Sight and Display Computer (ASDC) and Common Display Interface Units (CDIUs) onto Army Aviation Rotary Wing Aircraft as part of an upgrade to update software, provide an ability to interface with new color displays, provide a line of sight capability and to incorporate 3-D symbology.  The 3D flight symbology creates a virtual landing grid and a series of reference towers to improve the pilot's situational awareness (SA) when taking off and landing in the presence of visual obscurants.   The Helmet Display and Tracking System will be integrated onto Army CH-47F and UH-60A/L/M.  PM AW anticipates purchasing hardware that facilitates head position tracking - head tracking units (receivers and transmitters), location devices, etc. that are needed to enable 3-D flight symbology usage.  The tracking information from these components will be used in conjunction with the ASDC and a helmet mounted display to provide 3-D flight symbology to the pilots. PM AW will not purchase displays as part of this effort.  PM AW will continue to use the current ASDC and CDIU configuration as the display data computer.    <br>   PM AW is researching candidate solutions for the following components which currently interface with the ASDC and CDIU to provide line of sight capability:   <br> -  Advanced Magnetic Transmit Unit (AMTU)  <br> - Boresight Reticule Unit (BRU) Standard and Mirror <br> - Seat Position Sensors  <br> - Helmet Tracking Kit  <br> In order to meet the timelines for fielding HDTS, any contractor must have a qualified/or nearly qualified system and meet the following requirements: <br> (A)	  Interface with the ASDC and CDIU for data transfer and symbology display.   <br>  <br> (B)	  Interface with HGU-56P.  Any tracking components requiring helmet mounting must be able to interface with the HGU-56P.  The Army cannot procure or issue a new helmet type into the inventory. <br>  <br> (C)	  Meet Airworthiness (safety of flight) qualification and operational requirements in accordance with Attached Table of Requirements. <br>  <br> (D)	  Weight of any head tracking components mounted on the helmet shall not exceed 353 grams. <br>  <br> (E)	  Weight of aircraft mounted equipment shall not exceed 6.6 lbs.   <br>  <br> (F)	  Operate using power supplied by the ASDC.  <br>  <br> (G)	  All wiring and electrical practices shall be IAW SAE-AS50881D. <br>  <br> This effort would be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract utilizing Firm-Fixed Price delivery order for production of the Helmet Display and Tracking System (HDTS). <br>  <br> RESPONSES:  All interested parties should submit a written response to this SS/RFI.  Responses shall be limited to 15 one-sided pages.

<DESC>The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is conducting market research to make appropriate acquisition decisions and to gain knowledge of potential qualified contractors interested in and capable of performing the work.<br /><br />
<p>ICE is seeking information from companies who have the capability and experience to conduct audits of select ICE detention facilities to assess facility compliance with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulation titled, "Standards to Prevent, Detect, and Respond to Sexual Abuse and Assault in Confinement Facilities," 79 Fed. Reg. 13100 (Mar. 7, 2014) located at</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-03-07/pdf/2014-04675.pdf</strong>)</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) is responsible for detaining aliens pending immigration proceedings or their removal from the country.  In March 2014, DHS published standards pursuant to the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA), establishing robust safeguards against sexual abuse or assault of individuals in DHS custody.  These standards prescribe a wide range of requirements for ICE long-term detention facilities  and holding facilities  with regard to preventing and responding to incidents of sexual abuse or assault, including with respect to screening, staff training, detainee education, reporting, coordinated response, medical and mental health care, investigation, and data monitoring.  Under the regulation, each long-term detention facility covered by the PREA standards must be audited at least once every three years, and each holding facility housing detainees overnight must be audited within three years of July 6, 2015.  Holding facilities deemed by this initial audit to be "low-risk" must subsequently be audited at least once every five years, and all other holding facilities at least once every three years.  PREA standards do not become applicable to a long-term detention facility until they are incorporated into a new, renewed, or substantively modified facility contract; hence, the number of long-term detention facilities to be audited will increase gradually over time.</p>
<p>This RFI is being used to collect information about capability of qualified contractors to provide auditing services pursuant to the PREA regulations.  Auditing tools and methodology are currently under development, but will likely be similar to audit materials used for PREA audits conducted by the Department of Justice (DOJ).  Audits will consist of, at a minimum:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Review of policies, procedures, reports, internal and external audits, and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;accreditations for each facility type</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Review of a sampling of relevant documents and other records and information &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(including any available videotapes or other electronic data)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Observation of all areas of the audited facility</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Interviews with representative samples of facility detainees and staff</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Solicitation of input from community-based or victim advocates</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Verification of facility implementation of any corrective action plan developed for <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; identified deficiencies, and re-determination of facility compliance</p>
<p>For additional information about PREA requirements regarding the scope, content, and methodology for audits, please see the attached copy of the excerpted PREA regulations.</p>
<p>Contractors should have knowledge of the confinement setting and DHS PREA standards, and prior experience conducting audits of confinement facilities.  Experience conducting audits under PREA, or other audits related to sexual abuse or assault safeguards, standards or best practices, is preferred.  Formal DOJ PREA certification may be a requirement for auditors, or heads of auditing teams, in addition to some form of supplemental certification on DHS PREA standards.  Pursuant to &sect; 115.202(c) of the DHS PREA standards, contractors may not have received financial compensation from ICE within the past three years, except for compensation received from conducting other audits, or other consulting related to detention reform.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit the following information via email to brandiss.smith@ice.dhs.gov:</p>
<p>1.	Company name<br />2.	Company address<br />3.	POC information (name, title, phone number, email address, etc.)<br />4.	Company business size<br />5.	Socio-economic status<br />6. <strong>Copy of GSA schedule(s)&nbsp;</strong>(if applicable)<br />7.	Brief Company Capability statement (to include addressing all needs as stated <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; above). Contractors should specify their prior experience or contracts in the area, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and whether they possess any formal&nbsp;DOJ PREA certification.</p>
<p>THIS IS A RFI ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this announcement, and information submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned.</p>

<DESC>Solicit Comments on Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements at the Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA) Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas.
<p>Source Sought for PLAs Regarding Solicitation: W9126G-15-R-0024.</p>
<p>Title: Soliciting Comments on Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) at JBSA Air Force Base, San Antonio, TX.</p>
<p>Description: The Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements, (PLAs), for large scale construction contracts, (Exceeding $25 Million), for the following project: <br />Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA) Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>Replace existing Reid Medical Clinic at JBSA Lackland. <br />Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, TX 78236. <br />Project Description: Construction of the Medical Clinic Replacement Project on the Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA) Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. This project provides an 82,712 SF medical clinic, a 900 SF ambulance shelter, and 3,000 SF canopy/outdoor assembly area to replace the existing Reid Medical Clinic at JBSA Lackland. The existing clinic was built in 1967 and is significantly undersized for its current mission. The new facility will provide outpatient primary care for basic military trainees. The RFP for this design build project will be prepared by an A&amp;E Firm. Estimated 100% RFP Design Package on or about 28 January, 2015.</p>
<p>Project Number 081423. The project will be designed in accordance with criteria prescribed in Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-510-01, (MIL-HDBK-1191), DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings UFC 4-010-01, Americans with Disabilities Act and Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADA/ABAAG), and applicable energy conservation legislation. Additionally, it will be designed to LEED for Healthcare Silver Certified rating standard. Commissioning, operations and maintenance manuals, and comprehensive interior and furnishings will be provided. Air Conditioning: 280 tons.</p>
<p>Range of Magnitude: $30 to $40 Million. <br />Period of Performance: 2 years after date of award.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that maybe considered regarding their use are:<br />a.) The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br />b.) The complexity of the project.<br />c.) Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d.) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />e.) The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.<br />f.) The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />g.) The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br />h.) Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.<br />PLA is defined as a Pre-Hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).<br />Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), Policy:<br />a.) Project Labor Agreement,(PLA), is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.<br />b.) An Agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree for that project to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the Agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:<br />1.) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, produce-labor management stability and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health. Equal opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters and...<br />2.) Be consistent with law.<br />Reference Provision: 52.222-23 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreements.<br />In consideration of the above factors and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLA's. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:<br />a.) Should PLA's be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the Lackland Air Force Base? What other factors should the Corps of Engineers consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for the utilization of a PLA?<br />b.) Is the use of PLA's effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government if using PLA's? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br />c.) Is the use of PLA's effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?<br />d.) Is the use of PLA's conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLA's used for those specific contracts?<br />e.) Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing working in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both prime contractor and at least one subcontractor or two or more subcontractors employing the same trade? <br />f.) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.<br />g.) Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br />h.) Where have PLA's been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, Municipal or private entities in the Lackland Air Force Base area?<br />i.) Will the use of PLA's impact the ability of potential offerors and/or subcontractors to meet the Small Business utilization goals?</p>

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  
In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposals, responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to the Sources Sought Notice.  The purpose of this announcement is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification.  NAICS Code 562211 applies.
The South Texas Veterans Health Care System (STVHCS) is seeking potential sources capable of providing an effective automated on site-treatment system for the STVHCS. The objective of this procurement is to enhance, monitor, and dispose of hazardous regulated medical waste in accordance with VHA Directive 2009-065, Waste Minimization and Compliance Reporting. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) directive provides policy for collecting and reporting data required for reports for the Office of the Federal Environmental Executive, the agency environmental executive, and the Environmental Protection Agency on waste generation, waste disposal, and waste handling throughout VHA. The Resource Conversation and Recovery Act (RCRA), cover the generation, treatment, storage, disposal and transportation of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and emphasizes on source reduction as the highest priority. RCRA requires cradle-to-grave management of Hazardous Waste (HW).
The contractor shall furnish a self-contained unit that consists of both a sterilizer and compactor system to manage the medical and solid waste for the STVHCS. For the purpose of this delineated outline regarding the healthcare systems requirements, "self-contained" is defined as one unit or multiple units bonded to replicate a single unit.
The contractor must also furnish a unit that is constructed for outdoor use (the system must be built for external use, to include withstanding various types of weather and/or other environmental induced elements that occur when maintaining equipment away from a physical structure that acts as a shield).  Due to the facility being located in a prime area (within San Antonio's Medical Center), space is limited and we are essentially landlocked. With that stated, the contractor must furnish a self-contained unit that is suitable for the specified space dimensions (Length: 15ft by 7 in. and Width: 7ft by 10 in.). These dimensions are necessary to conform to the existing surrounding structures and equipment needed to maintain facility operations. In addition to the space requirements, the self-contained unit must conform to existing sanitary sewer drains.
Responses to this sources sought notice must include the following information: 1) Company name, address, contact person name, phone number, email address, DUNS #, and business size/classification/type (i.e. 8a, Hubzone, SDVOSB, VOSB, etc.), NAICS code, and state either you distribute or manufacture these items.  Responses to this Sources Sought Notice should be emailed to kevin.johnson8@va.gov.  Responses must be received no later than 4:00 PM 12/17/2014.  No solicitation document is available at this time.  This notice is simply for Market Research Purposes only.

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and shall not be considered an Invitation for Bids, Request for Quotations, or a Request for Proposal.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract; there is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI.  Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider,  you are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in your response, and all information received in response to this RFI that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI, you will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI, and responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in developing its acquisition strategy and Performance Work Statement  

RFI OBJECTIVE

The primary purpose of this RFI is to seek information on existing technologies (or technologies with reasonable modifications) that can be used to meet the needs of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the cemetery tracking capabilities described in the requirements section below.  Furthermore, this RFI serves to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price, cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices, and gather other market information readily available.

BACKGROUND / SCOPE

The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) honors Veterans and their families with final resting places in national shrines and with lasting tributes that commemorate their service and sacrifice to our Nation. NCA maintains approximately 3.3 million gravesites at 131 national cemeteries, on national Veterans' burial ground and 33 soldiers' lots and monument sites in 40 states and Puerto Rico. NCA manages approximately 20,500 acres within its cemeteries. This has the potential to provide approximately 6.5 million gravesites. The NCA oversaw 124,787 interments in Fiscal Year 2013. The number of internments is expected to increase annually until the year 2020. (Veterans Affairs, National Cemetery Administration, 2014)

NCA continually strives to improve the IT systems that underlie its mission operations through the investment of resources to automate manual business processes, and enable the needs of NCA employees as well as Veterans and their families. Over the past 25 years these enhancements and revisions to the systems have evolved into the Burial Operations Support System (BOSS) Enterprise suite of applications that support the NCA environment.  Currently the architecture faces a number of challenges and requirements gaps that are significant enough in their size that NCA and its Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) partners are evaluating new potential platforms for supporting the NCA mission going forward.

The current BOSS Enterprise provides the NCA the ability to:
o	Receive applications, determine eligibility, schedule interments, and inter decedents
o	Receive applications, determine eligibility, and provide services like Headstone, Memorials, and Markers; Presidential Memorial Certificates, and other services.
o	Manage cemeteries, employees, volunteers, and visitors.

REQUIREMENTS

With the potential for 6.5 million gravesites, the scope of assets which NCA manages makes it imperative that NCA has contemporary information systems to support the efficient delivery of memorial benefits to our Veterans, beneficiaries, and next of kin. 

NCA is interested in the delivery of cemetery tracking capabilities as a single integrated solution that may have one or more products, a solution that may be a subcomponent of a larger product, or as single product. The Cemetery Tracking Solution (CTS) should include robust functionality that will allow NCA to perform the critical tasks of Digital Mapping, INDS and Remains Tracking over a Wide-Area Network (WAN) deployment.  A commercial Cloud-based solution or Software-As-A-Service (SaaS) will not be considered.

NCA leadership has identified the below features as required of the CTS Information regarding additional cemetery management features that are not within the categories below are not desired nor are considered of additional value to NCA.

A.	Digital Mapping
o	Interactive Mapping - NCA internal users need an interactive mapping solution for the tracking of gravesites using a PC or mobile device. The system will automatically update cemetery maps from the creation of new cemetery maps and sections to the assignment and closure of an individual gravesite. 
o	Gravesite Inventory - Gravesite inventory tracking should include a visual representation of gravesites, link detailed data about the gravesite to the gravesite location on the map, and support tracking real-time inventory of all gravesites by type. 
o	Cemetery Mapping - The mapping function should track occupied graves, gravesite set-asides, gravesite reservations, obstructed sites, roads, shelters, and other landmarks. The mapping solution should allow the Memorial Service Networks (MSNs) to identify future gravesite layouts, and allow for gravesite usage forecasting that supports gravesite construction projects. 
o	User Interface - The digital mapping module should generate a visual representation of the selected cemetery on a PC or mobile device. The features will be used for broad views such as the areas within a cemetery and locations as well as granular views such as individual gravesites and their attributes.  Each cemetery will have access to their map as well as the satellite cemetery map.  The driving directions provided by mobile mapping should help NCA external users within or near the cemetery. The system should support a detailed printing of maps that can be used by the public and visitors to identify a specific gravesite location in a section. NCA needs mapping capabilities on both PC and mobile devices. For NCA external users, mapping requirements include the abilities to locate a cemetery, view the burial schedule at any national cemetery, provide information about NCA burial and memorial benefits, and send comments, questions, and feedback to the VA.
o	Data Frequency - The suggested implementation should result in real-time updating of cemetery maps displaying information regarding burials, cemetery layouts, etc.

B.	Interment Notice/Dig Slips (INDS) 
The INDS is a notice to both the office and field personnel. It informs the office personnel that an interment has been placed on the cemetery's daily schedule by the National Cemetery Scheduling Office (NCSO). It also informs the field personnel to open a gravesite and should provide specific information on the gravesite and surrounding gravesites. The INDS system shall also provide an electronic Interment Notice/Dig slip populated with data already entered in the enterprise system.

o	Creation of INDS - For all interments,  the solution must create an Interment Notice (also referred to as a Dig Slip) that informs the interment crew of the section, row, and gravesite number to be opened, the depth and position of the new interment, and type of outer container (if appropriate). The solution should provide a standardized and automated INDS that will track the cemetery staff interment process to its completion. The INDS will display information on the associated Veteran, decedent, and adjacent gravesites.
o	INDS Validation - The Interment Notice will be verified and signed off for every interment as part of a daily interment process checklist, and again at the end of day check. 
o	Gravesite Validation - The NCA needs the ability to produce Dig Slips that properly identify the gravesite to be used and incorporates the necessary checks used by the cemetery to ensure the proper burial of the remains.  
o	Tracking of Work Assignments - The solution will capture the amount of time field crews and other personnel expend on a particular duty.
o	Asset Assignment - The foreman will be able to make backhoe and dump truck assignments for gravesite excavations and closings.  
o	Hand-held Interface - The field crew will have the ability to view and update the INDS on a hand-held device. The INDS will be viewable on both the hand-held device and the enterprise system. The foreman in the office can make assignments to the field crew in the field.
o	Remains Tracking Integration - The INDS will also capture the final remains tracking from the shelter to the gravesite and associated signature(s). The INDS should be able to be printed or viewed on a remote device and would eliminate any need to look up surrounding gravesites in the system or maps.

C.	Remains Tracking
The NCA needs a system that automates the tracking of remains from the time the remains are received at the cemetery until the time the remains are laid to rest in the gravesite. This includes the transfer from the funeral home or family to the cemetery representatives to the foreman/caretaker to the final resting place. 
o	Editing of Decedent Information - The solution shall be flexible enough to allow authorized users to add and edit information in the Decedent Interment record to address real-time scenarios associated with the receipt, movement, and tracking of decedent remains.
o	AIDC - The system should use Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) technology to verify the casket, urn, temporary marker, gravesite, and permanent marker are accurately located. A hand-held device or quick way to verify proper placement of casket, temporary marker, and permanent marker is required. Integral to Remains Tracking and the identified activities, is the standardized and automated Interment Notice/Dig Slip.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)/Plant Protection Quarantine (PPQ) in Fort Collins, CO intends to award a sole source, Purchase Order to NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY for Web Access to a Dairy Herd Improvement Association Data Base which is a data capture source for dairy herd and productivity parameters in the U.S. <br />This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1
<p>The supplies or services needed are available from only one responsible qualified source at this time and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy these needs.</p>
<p>National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) has been working with 2 of Dairy Herd Improvement Association 's (DHIA) 4 Dairy Records Processing Centers (DRPC) to get access to their herd level summary data. Two of the DRPCs (Dairy Records Management System - ORMS, and AgSource) represent 16,000 dairy herds (- 35% of U.S. dairy operations) and 2.5 million dairy cows (- 25% of U.S. dairy cows) from across the U.S. NAHMS analyzes this data (over 200 variables per herd) to evaluate changes in the industry and to assess surveillance activities. For the last 2 years, ORMS and AgSource have provided the data on a monthly basis at no charge. Starting August 2014, however, ORMS with the largest number of herds (- 13,000) will begin charging for the data: tiny_mce_marker.25 per herd/month. This charge is significantly less than what DRPC charges other stakeholders for data (&gt;$1.00 per herd/month).<br />NAHMS dairy studies gather information on the industry every 5 to 7 years. To get more current and ongoing information about the dairy industry, NAHMS has the opportunity to continue receiving data from DHIA to assist in dairy cattle health and monitoring. The normal charge for these data is &gt;$1.00 per herd/month DRMS and AgSource have agreed to a discounted rate of tiny_mce_marker.25 per herd/month. Negotiations are underway for the other 2 DRPCs.<br /><br />This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored. However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products and services, as well as three (3) references from other customers who are using these services, to the Contracting Officer by 4:00pm. Central Time (CT) on the closing date of this notice. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 519130 (Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals). The Small business size standard is 500 employees.<br /><br />Responses received after the response date or without the required information will be deemed nonresponsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. Capability statements may be sent to:<br /><br />Jeanine Goral, USDA-APHIS-MRPBS, AAMD Procurement Branch, 100 North Sixth Street, Suite 510C, Minneapolis, MN 55403, or via email @ Jeanine,j.goral@aphis.usda.gov or fax @ 612-336-3550.</p>

ORP intends to award a sole-source contract modification to EnergySolutions Federal EPC, Inc., located at 2345 Stevens Drive, Suite 240, Richland, WA 99354. 
Work under Modification 006 will support development of the vitrification process for the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP).  The WTP is expected to treat both high-level waste (HLW) and low-activity waste (LAW).
CLIN 0018: Enhanced LAW Glass Correlation The extensive glass formulation development work that underpins the WTP baseline LAW glasses was captured in a correlation that was developed by VSL and EnergySolutions that permits the calculation of the glass formulation required for each particular batch of LAW delivered to the LAW vitrification facility. The correlation is based on the baseline LAW glasses developed for the WTP with particular emphasis on those subjected to melter testing, especially in the LAW Pilot Melter. The composition outputs from the LAW correlation are designed such that they can tolerate expected processing variations without adversely affecting properties relevant to processing and product quality. This LAW correlation, along with the LAW glass property-composition models, will be used to control glass compositions for LAW vitrification at the WTP. Since the LAW correlation was developed, VSL and EnergySolutions have developed considerably higher waste loading LAW glass formulations under a program directed by ORP. These ORP glass formulations explored the limits of waste loading achievable in LAW glasses for various LAW streams with varying alkali and sulfate concentrations. While these ORP glasses provide much higher loadings, which result in substantial reduction in the amount of LAW glass to be produced at Hanford, in order to utilize them for LAW processing at the WTP new LAW glass property-composition models and a new LAW correlation that incorporates these enhanced glass formulations are required. Enhanced LAW glass property-composition models that incorporate these higher waste loading ORP compositions are being developed under separate tasks in the ORP program. The objective of the present task is to develop an Enhanced LAW Correlation, which along with the enhanced LAW glass property-composition models, can be used fo r LAW processing at the WTP with the higher waste loading ORP LAW glass formulations. The proposed work will include crucible scale testing to define and confirm the correlation that is developed. These results will then be used to select LAW glass formulations for initial DM100 melter tests to verify acceptable processing characteristics and absence secondary sulfate phase formation. The glass compositions for testing will be defined such that they can tolerate expected process variations in batching without adverse effects such as secondary phase formation on very slow processing rate. The results from testing will be analyzed to support development of an initial Enhanced LAW Correlation, which will be further refined and verified in subsequent work.

CLIN 0019: Effect of Re Concentration on Re Retention One of the DM10 melter systems installed at the VSL has been equipped with the components that are prototypical of those in the WTP primary off-gas systems, specifically, the Submerged Bed Scrubber (SBS) and the Wet Electrostatic Precipitator (WESP); the DM10 system also includes a vacuum evaporator that allows testing to be conducted under recycle conditions. This is an efficient and economical system on which to obtain information on the compositions of the primary off-gas system effluents. Under a separate task, tests will be performed on this system to determine the compositions of the melter off-gas and effluent streams from the off-gas system, especially the SBS and the WESP, in order to assess potential disposition strategies for those streams. In these tests, rhenium will be added to the feed as a surrogate for technetium at a concentration of 0.05 wt% ReO2. Since the technetium concentration in the actual LAW WTP glasses is expected to be much lower (typically, around 3 ppm) , the possible effects of concentration on retention in glass and partitioning to the SBS and WESP effluents are also of importance. In the present task, DM10 melter tests will be conducted with the ORPLA20 high waste loading glass composition at two different rhenium concentrations, one at about 10 ppm Re and the other at a concentration that is intermediate between that and the concentration of 0.05 wt% ReO2 in the glass. Since there are no data on technetium retention in high waste loading ORP glasses, one test will be conducted with 99mTc to determine single-pass Tc retention in the ORPLA20 glass formulation. Since ppm, or lower, levels of Re need to be analyzed in the glass, off-gas emissions, and SBS and WESP effluents, it is necessary to use analytical techniques with low detection limits and high accuracy and precision appropriate for these low concentrations; analysis by Induction Coupled Plasma ? Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS) will be used for this purpose. A large number of Re concentration measurements by ICP-MS will be required to determine Re partitioning between the glass, SBS, and WESP, and to track Re  concentration evolution in the glass as a function of melter run time at low Re concentrations. 
CLIN 0020: High Waste Loading Glass Formulation Development for High-P HLW WTP flow-sheet projections indicate that a number of HLW streams to be processed at the WTP will have high phosphorous concentrations. These high-P HLW frequently contain other components such as Bi, Fe, Ca, and various rare earths. Previous studies for ORP have explored some of the HLW that contain relatively high concentrations of both Bi and P, but did not focus on HLW for which glass waste loading is limited solely by P, or those containing high concentrations P together with Fe, Ca, and/or rare earths. Interactions between P and Ca or rare earths are known and can lead to poor cold cap behavior and slow processing rates. 
The work in the present task will focus on developing high waste loading glass formulations with good processing characteristics to treat high-P Hanford HLW. The HLW compositions for the work will either be specified by ORP or selected in consultation with ORP. Crucible melts will be prepared and characterized to identify high waste loading glass compositions that meet all WTP processing and product quality requirements. Vertical gradient furnace tests will be used to screen the glass compositions for feed processing characteristics. The processing characteristics of a selected glass formulation will be assessed using DM100 melter testing. The melter test will be used to determine feed processing rate, cold-cap behavior, feed carry over, etc., and to identify any processing issues.
CLIN 0021: Vitrification of Inorganic Ion-Exchange Media ORP is considering direct feeding of the LAW at Hanford to the vitrification facility with minimal or no pretreatment due to currently projected delays in the completion of the pretreatment facility. The currently planned baseline technology at the WTP for cesium removal is ion-exchange with elutable organic resins. The eluants will be directed to HLW vitrification and the spent ion-exchange resins will be stored and eventually disposed of as solid waste; however, the disposal path for the spent organic ion-exchange resins has not been finalized. Inorganic zeolite-based ion-exchange media were used successfully for cesium removal at the WVDP, where the loaded media were ground and mixed with the HLW sludge stream and vitrified. Testing has also been performed on other inorganic ion-exchange media such as crystalline silicotitanate (CST), which has been considered for applications at both DWPF and Hanford. The present task will focus on cesium removal from LAW using inorganic ion-exchange media and subsequent vitrification of the loaded media. The media that will be tested will be selected on the basis of projected Cs removal performance and compatibility with Hanford LAW as well as likely impacts on HLW vitrification and loadings. Candidate media will include zeolites and CST and the selected media will be tested for cesium removal performance in simulated Hanford LAW streams. Compatibility with vitrification in combination with Hanford HLW streams will be assessed through a series of crucible melts together with gradient furnace tests to provide an initial assessment of potential impacts on melting behavior and melt rates. The results will be used to assess the achievable loadings of the ion-exchange media and potential impacts on HLW loadings in the glass. The glass formulations will be tested for compliance with applicable WTP processing and product quality requirements.

CLIN 0022: Long Term PCT Testing of LAW Glasses VSL has accumulated a large collection of on-going leach tests on a wide range of waste glasses that spans time periods of nearly 36 years. These tests employ a variety of test methods and include PCT tests that span time periods of 20 years or more (dating back to the original development of the PCT method). The PCT tests include tests in stainless steel and Teflon vessels, at temperatures from 20&#61616;C to 90&#61616;C, and over a range of ratios of the glass surface area to the solution volume (S/V). In the present task, long-term PCT test data on Hanford LAW glasses will be reviewed, analyzed, and reported. The results will be used to identify samples for which additional PCT leachate analyses would be useful and those samples will be collected and analyzed. The results will also be used to identify tests for which the altered glass and secondary phases will be analyzed. For those tests, selected vessels will be opened and small amounts of the solids will be removed and prepared for analysis that will include SEM/EDS and XRD. The data will be analyzed to determine factors such as reaction progress and secondary phase formation under various conditions, the onset of leach rate resumption, effects of surface to volume ratio on long-term PCT leaching, effects of temperature on PCT test results, and the long-term reproducibility of PCT test results.
17.	Place of Contract Performance: Catholic University of America, Vitreous State Laboratory; Washington D.C. 20064.
18.	Set-Aside Status: Not set-aside
Competition Exception ORP has determined that this requirement can only be satisfied by the unique services offered by EnergySolutions Federal EPC, Inc.  The statutory authority permitting this action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), where a determination has been made that the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  EnergySolutions Federal EPC, Inc., through its exclusivity agreement with Catholic University of America (CUA), Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL), is the only firm that is uniquely capable of providing the technical expertise and facilities necessary to complete the tasks described above.  These tasks will be performed at the glass development laboratory and melter test facility at CUA-VSL, in Washington, D.C.  Performance of these tasks requires the use of DM10, DM100, and DM1200 melters (the three melters reside at CUA-VSL); and expertise with LAW and HLW formulation/property relatio nships.  Additionally, one of the tasks involves the compilation and analysis of leaching data that has been ongoing at the CUA for ca. 2 decades.  EnergySolutions Federal EPC, Inc. is the only source with the required equipment (CUA-VSL houses the only DM10, DM100, and DM1200 melters in existence) and technical expertise to perform the work in the required timeframe.
Unsolicited Proposals  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>On February 20, 2013, NASAs Game Changing Development Program issued NASA Research Announcement NNL12A3001N, Appendix D entitled "Technology Development for Miniaturized Electrospray Propulsion (MEP) Technologies in Support of Small Satellite Propulsion Systems. NRA Appendix D involved a progressive competition process and two acquisition phases: in Phase I, the selected offerors would complete the design, development, fabrication, and testing of micro-thruster technologies; and in Phase II, the selected micro-thruster technology would be further developed to TRL 6 and for a possible space flight demonstration via the Small Spacecraft Technology (SST) Program. Contracts for Phase I were issued in September 2013.	In accordance with NASA FAR Supplement 1817.7301-4, the Government did not intend to issue a new, formal solicitation for Phase II, however Phase II would be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.201 and 5.203. <p> This is formal notification that NASA LaRC will not be proceeding with the execution of Phase II under this NRA Appendix.  This synopsis is for information purposes only.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. <p> Questions regarding this communication shall be directed to LaShonda Jacobs-Terry (<a href="mailto:lashonda.p.jacobs-terry@nasa.gov">lashonda.p.jacobs-terry@nasa.gov </a> ).

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>1. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The San Juan National Forest, Durango, CO intends to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with one or more providers to satisfy the requirement for organizing, facilitating, and Documenting meetings. However, the Government reserves the right to award a single-award BPA, if it determines it is in the Government's best interest to do so. These services will be provided in accordance with the provided Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>2. This requirement is a small business set-aside. See clause 52.212-2, Evaluation Procedures, for further details on evaluation procedures (Attached). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541618 and the Size Standard for Small Business is $15 Million. The requirement consists of establishing one or more BPAs, for a period of three (3) years from date of award, via issuance of BPA Call Orders. The BPA Master Dollar Limit shall be $150,000. The BPA Call Limit shall be $30,000.00. The Government may issue a BPA Call for one project meeting or a BPA Call for more meetings up to the BPA Call Limit specified.</p>
<p>3. The Government intends to enter into a BPA for one base year (30 January 2015 to 31 December 2015) with two (2) option years. The BPA will be reviewed annually. This BPA will have a period of performance of three (3) years from date of agreement or until the total spent on the master BPA reaches $150,000 (whichever is sooner), or until such time either party to this agreement requests that it be canceled in writing (30 day notice required).</p>
<p>4. Please note that a BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a streamlined method for acquiring services on an as-needed basis from qualified sources that are readily available and thus eliminate the need for repetitive costly re-procurements. There is no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity. All BPA Call Orders must be acknowledged by the selected vendor in order to be retained on the BPA calling list. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this notice.</p>
<p>5. Offers shall include with their quotes a completed copy of 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items or enter at website https://www.sam.gov; if Representations and Certifications have been completed on System for Award Management (SAM) provide Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) code.</p>

If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.<br /><br />Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-</p>
<p>(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p>(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-</p>

<p>(2) [ ] Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));</p>
<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>(t) System for Award Management (SAM).</p>
<p>(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p>(u) Unauthorized Obligations</p>
<p>(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:</p>
<p>(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.</p>
<p>(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.</p>
<p>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>

<p>DTAR1052.232-1 Electronic Invoicing and Payment Requirements for the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) (Aug 2012)<br />The U.S. Department of the Treasury, Financial Managements Internet Payment Platform (IPP) is a government-wide electronic payment information service that replaces the Payment Advice Internet Delivery (PAID) system. IPP allows vendors to receive their remittance information from their financial institution. Effective October 31, 2008, IPP replaced the PAID system. Former PAID users have been automatically migrated to IPP and need to complete the initial provisioning process from the new user ID, temporary password, and web address sent by Treasury. This is necessary in order to log in to the IPP and view or download payment information. New vendors may register on-line at https://ipp.gov. For additional information, refer to the IPP Customer Support at (866) 973-3131.<br />The IPP will continue to support the following notification services previously offered by PAID: Web access only to remittance data, no payment notification emails sent, payment notification without remittance detail, and payment notification with remittance detail. Users may select event-driven notifications and schedule the frequency. Vendors can only access their own payment data. IPP remittance information includes the following data: ACH trace number, supplier name, agency name, payment status, issue date, invoice number, PO number, invoice amount, discount amount, payment amount, bank name, and bank address. The IPP will collect payment data for 18 months, which will be available for search, display and download. Payment information will be uploaded to the IPP daily from Treasury systems on the date of payment.</p>

The AMC code for this item is 3H which certifies the requirement to be acquired directly from the actual manufacturer, whether or not the prime contractor is the actual manufacturer. The government physically does not have in its possession sufficient, accurate, or legible data to purchase this part from other than current source(s). Therefore, this is a sole source requirement. Even though this item is sole source, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
  

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support procure via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the Government for procurement of this item will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. Contractors interested in seeking source approval for consideration on future solicitations for this item, should seek source approval from NAVSUPWSS Source Development at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navsupwss/business_opps/SAR%20Spares%20Brochure.pdf.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), located on the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a five-year blanket purchase agreement (BPA) with Harlan Laboratories in Indianapolis, IN, for feed and bedding supplies for laboratory animal research conducted at USU and the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) in Bethesda, MD.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This requirement will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sole source determination is made in accordance with:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">FAR Subpart 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(b) Soliciting from a single source</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">FAR Subpart 13.500(a) General</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(a) This subpart authorizes, as a test program, use of simplified procedures for the acquisition of supplies and services in amounts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $6.5&nbsp;million ($12&nbsp;million for acquisitions as described in 13.500(e)), including options, if the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature of the supplies or services sought, and on market research, that offers will include only commercial items.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The type of research being conducted on laboratory animals includes: molecular biology, neurobiology, neuropsychology, and infectious disease. Harlan Laboratories currently provides specific animal feed and bedding, which have a predictable quality control and influence on the outcome of research. Changing vendors would add uncertain variability into experimental animal conditions which could have a detrimental effect on the outcome of research.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued.&nbsp; Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified.&nbsp; A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government.&nbsp; Responses must be received via email (malika.graham@usuhs.edu) by 9:00 a.m. EST on January 12, 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-15-Q-200036 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78 effective 25 November 2014.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413.  The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a competitive basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)s, Thales Avionics (Cage Code 0J2T3) and Thales Avionics France (Cage Code F0296).  Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

See Attached Spreadsheet HSCG38-15-Q-200036 - Requirements 

See Attached Document Titled HSCG38-15-Q-200036 - Terms And Conditions 

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.  The Government shall ensure all procurements are awarded without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, or a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems.  Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) H-65 aircraft. 

The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance (COC) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. Certificate of Conformance must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.  All parts shall be NEW approved parts.

There are multiple OEMs associated with the parts contained within this solicitation. Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to the manufacturer, manufacturer's COC and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on USCG aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.  

Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government.  For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.

NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449).

Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>

<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>
<p>(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;</p>
<p>(5) Terms of any express warranty;</p>
<p>(6) Price and any discount terms;</p>
<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>

<p>(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;</p>
<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.</p>

<p>(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.</p>
<p>(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any <br />Government authorized end user to such clause.</p>
<p>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The SSA will base the source selection decision on an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation (described below).</p>
<p>While the Government source selection evaluation team and the SSA will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective and, therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>B. NUMBER OF CONTRACTS TO BE AWARDED <br />The Government intends to select one contractor for this acquisition. However, the Government reserves the right not to award a contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>C. REJECTION OF UNREALISTIC OFFERS <br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract or price terms and conditions, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>D. CORRECTION POTENTIAL OF PROPOSALS<br />The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any proposal uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an Offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the Offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.</p>
<p>E. EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />1. Factors:<br />Factor 1 - Cost/Price</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Technical<br />Subfactor 1 - Security Management<br />Subfactor 2 - Program Management<br />Subfactor 3 - Technical Expertise</p>
<p>Award will be made to the Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors herein. <br />2. Order of Importance:<br />In LPTA, Proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors. <br />3. Evaluation Methodology:</p>
<p>Proposals will be first evaluated by price and then evaluated for technical acceptance. Once the offers are ranked by TEP, they will then be evaluated for technical acceptability from lowest price to highest price until a technically acceptable offer is found. When the offer with the lowest price is deemed technically acceptable, no further technical evaluations will be conducted for any of the remaining offers. Technical evaluations shall be evaluated as set forth in paragraph 5 below, with a determination of Acceptable or Unacceptable. <br />4. Factor 1 - Cost/Price:</p>
<p>(1) Total Evaluated Price (TEP)<br />The offeror's Price Volume will be evaluated for award purposes based upon the total anticipated contract value. The Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be calculated as the sum of the Firm-Fixed-Price sub-CLINs under CLINs 0001-0003, and the sum of the sub-CLINs under CLIN 0002, "over and above" shall be evaluated for balance and reasonableness by comparing against commercial market rates and or wage determination rates. The TEP will be provided to the Source Selection Authority (SSA) for consideration in the best value decision.</p>
<p>(2) Price Reasonableness<br />An offeror's Price Volume will be evaluated, using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is reasonable. A price is reasonable when it provides best value to the Government when consideration is given to the current market prices, technical and functional capabilities of the offeror and risk. IAW FAR 15.403-1(b), the Government may require submission of information other than cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to evaluate price criteria for reasonableness. When adequate price competition exists, generally no additional information is necessary to determine the reasonableness of price.</p>
<p>(3) Unbalanced CLIN Prices<br />Price analysis and evaluation of the information in the Price Volume will be used to determine if the prices for the proposed contract line items are balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total solicitation effort price, the price of one or more contract line items or sub line items appears to be significantly over or under-stated. Unbalanced pricing may result in an offer being rejected if the Government determines that it presents an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>F. TRADEOFFS<br />Tradeoffs are not permitted in LPTA procedures.</p>
<p>G. DISCUSSIONS<br />It is the Government's intent to award without discussions; therefore, it is imperative that offerors submit their best terms initially. However, if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government, they will be held in written format.</p>
<p>H. SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as complete terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide accompanying rationale.<br />5. Factor 2 - Technical:<br />Each subfactor within the technical factor will receive one of the ratings described below based on the criteria listed below. Individual subfactor ratings will be used to determine the overall technical acceptability of each proposal. To be technically acceptable at the factor level, the Offeror must be rated acceptable in each subfactor. A final unacceptable subfactor assessment will determine an overall technical unacceptable rating.</p>
<p>ACCEPTABLE - The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>UNACCEPTABLE - The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an Unacceptable rating are not awardable.<br /><br /><br />Subfactor 1: Security Management<br />The Government will assess the Offeror's proposed Security Management approach.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this solicitation will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>New equipment/parts only.  No remanufactured products. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>FAR 52.211-6 -- Brand Name or Equal is incorporated into this solicitation and any subsequent awards. To meet the Brand Name or Equal provision the Quoter must: (a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as ?brand name or equal,? the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government?s needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that ?equal? products must meet are specified in the solicitation. (b) To be considered for award, offers of ?equal? products, including ?equal? products of the brand name manufacturer, must? (1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; (2) Clearly identify the item by? (i) Brand name, if any; and (ii) Make or model number; (3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and (4) Clearly describe any modification the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modification. (c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate ?equal? products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. (d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an ?equal? product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price and total price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this quote will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>The contract price includes all applicable Federal, state, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.) <BR> <BR>The contractor shall stamp or mark the supplies delivered or otherwise furnish notice with the supplies of the existence of a warranty.  Markings shall include (i) a brief statement that a warranty exists, (ii) the substance of the warranty, (iii) its duration, and (iv) who to notify if the supplies are found to be defective. <BR> <BR>THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO ASSIST YOU, AND WILL HELP TO EXPEDITE PAPERWORK AND PAYMENT.
     a. Only one delivery will be accepted against each line item.  Backorders will NOT be accepted on individual line items.     b. Deliver on or before date specified.  Deliveries will be accepted Monday through Friday (except Holidays) from 7:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. to Block 15 of the Purchase Order.  Notify the individual in Block 16 of any delay encountered (due to strikes, factory backorders, etc.)  and give revised delivery date if possible.     c. Mark outside of all cartons.  Put packing list inside cartons.  Show the order number assigned, the PR number shown at the end of each item, and the quantity shipped.  All items will be identified by the part number by attached tag and/or stamped identification.     d. On direct shipments, have the supplier or manufacturer cite our order number on packages.  This eliminates delay caused by trying to determine the firm awarded the original order. <BR> <BR>Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the contractor shall obtain any necessary licenses and permits, give all notices, and comply with any applicable Federal, State, County, and municipal laws, codes, and regulations in connection with this award. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall not make news releases or otherwise provide information relative to the performance of this contract or information relative to any incident occurring on JBLM without prior approval of the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Thus the sensitive GFI is packaged and made available on CD(s) via classified transport.   <br>    <br>   	When the government agency determines that the solicitation contains information that requires additional controls to monitor access and distribution (i.e., technical data, specifications, designs, etc.)  <br>   	When unauthorized disclosure of the information would compromise the national security (e.g., would result in disclosure of classified information, or information subject to export controls) or create other security risks.   <br>    <br>  The information within the GFI contains classified and control unclassified military critical technologies, and technical data in which Distribution Statement F applies-further dissemination only directed by Project Manager Electronic Warfare.

<DESC>Question and Answer Two (2)  <br> Amendment #5 updates the Performance Work Statement (PWS) by adding the section 5.3 Areas to be Cleared, clarifies federal/contractor holidays and adds the revised Pricing Schedule. <br>  <br> Q3 - Would it be permissible to place storage containers to store sidewalk salt and small equipment at the salt domes (or other location) at both the Aberdeen and Edgewood areas? <br>  <br> A3 - DPW will provide a location for a storage container at the salt dome for each area. The contractor will be responsible for locking and removal at the end of the snow season. The Government offers no surveillance.  <br>  <br> Q4 - Would it be permissible to place an above ground fuel tank for fueling small equipment at the salt domes (or other location) at both the Aberdeen and Edgewood areas? <br>  <br> A4 - No above ground fuel tanks. The contractor will be responsible for the fueling of equipment and vehicles. <br>  <br> Q5 - If the area is subjected to multiple snow events it may become necessary to load and transport snow by truck to the approved stockpile locations. This work would entail additional cost to the contractor over and above the costs associated with clearing a specific depth of snow.  Are we to anticipate the potential for this to occur and incorporate those costs into the bid items presently provided or will an additional bid item be added specifically to cover loading and transport of snow? <br>  <br> A5 - Line 14 is added to the bidders list for this requirement. <br>  <br> Q6 - How will instances of freezing rain be dealt with when plowing is not required but salt is? (We believe this to be in reference to the way the contractor will get paid.) <br>  <br> A6 - This will have to be paid under a 0 quote mark  to 2 quote mark  CLIN. <br>  <br> Q7 - Will the contractor be required to wait for a call prior to mobilizing or will the contractor be allowed to mobilize and begin work as (s)he sees fit? <br>  <br> A7 -The contractor will be contacted and will have a two hour response time beginning at that phone call. <br>  <br> Q8 - How will the contractor be compensated in the event of a government delay in providing/loading of road salt? <br>  <br> A8 -The Government will have personnel on site at all snow events. <br>  <br> Statement - The fenced areas of 3090 and 3200 presently contain a significant quantity of vehicles and equipment in the secure area. <br>  <br> Q9 - Can the 90% clear requirement be reduced in these locations to allow for areas made inaccessible by these obstructions? <br>  <br> A9 - Yes, For Building 3090 there is no requirement for snow removal inside the fenced in area. <br>  <br> Q10 - Please clarify the access arrangements for the secure areas to the rear of E-3400 in Edgewood and the fenced areas at 3090 & 3200 in Aberdeen. <br>  <br> A10 - All secured areas at Aberdeen and Edgewood will be confirmed by the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) prior to access.  <br>  <br> Q11 - There is a Parking lot arm at 5100, will that be open during snow plow operations. <br>  <br> A11 - Yes, the arm will be open during snow events. <br>  <br> Q12 - The 6000 Complex, are the interior walks and court yard all part of this proposal, or is it done by housekeeping. <br>  <br> A12 - The interior court yard shall be completed by the contractor and is included in section 5.3, area description to be cleared, of the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Maps displayed during the site visit were for reference only. A complete set of maps shall be given to the contractor who wins the award. <br> (End of Q&A #2) <br>  <br> 5.3 Area description to be cleared <br>   8.5 Miles of roadway to be cleared. <br>   45,000 Linear Foot of sidewalk to be cleared. <br>   74 Acres of parking space to be cleared. <br>   20 Each of air conditioners to be cleared. <br>   80 entrance ways to be cleared. <br>   12 flights of stairs to be cleared. <br>   All locked, secured areas shall be reported to the COR immediately. <br> 		BASE YEAR			 <br> Event#	Base Year Snow Removal Contract  SUPPLIES/SERVICES	UNIT	 QTY 	 UNIT PRICE 	 AMOUNT  <br> 					 <br> 0001	Base Year Snow Removal 0 quote mark -2 quote mark 	Each	12	 	 <br> 	(On site within 2 Hours of notification)				 <br>  	 				 <br> 0002	Base Year Snow Removal 2 quote mark -4 quote mark 	Each	12	 	 <br> 	(On site within 2 hours of notification)				 <br>  	 				 <br> 0003	Base Year Snow Removal 4 quote mark -8 quote mark 	Each	10		 <br> 	(On site within 2 hours of notification)				 <br> 	 				 <br> 0004	Base Year Snow Removal 8 quote mark -14 quote mark 	Each	5		 <br> 	(On site within 2 hours of notification)				 <br> 					 <br> 0005	Base Year Snow Removal 14 quote mark +	Each	2		 <br> 	 				 <br> 0006	Base Year Snow Removal  Sidewalks 0-2 quote mark 	LF	534,000		 <br> 	(One event includes 44,500 LF of sidewalk)				 <br> 					 <br> 0007	Base Year Snow Removal Sidewalks  2 quote mark -4 quote mark 	LF	534,000		 <br> 	(One event includes 44,500 LF of sidewalk)				 <br>  	 				 <br> 0008	Base Year Snow Removal Sidewalks 4 quote mark -8 quote mark 	LF	445,000		 <br> 	(One event includes 44,500 LF of sidewalk)				 <br> 	 				 <br> 0009	Base Year Snow Removal Sidewalks 8 quote mark -14 quote mark 	LF	222,500		 <br> 	(One event includes 44,500 LF of sidewalk)				 <br> 					 <br> 0010	Base Year Snow Removal Sidewalks  14 quote mark +	LF	89,000		 <br> 	(One event includes 44,500 LF of sidewalk)				 <br> 					 <br> 0011	Base Year Ice Melt	Pallet	20		 <br> 					 <br> 0012	Salt Containers	Each	40		 <br>  					 <br> 0013	Base Year Contract Manpower Reporting	Each	1		 <br> 	http://www.cmra.mil 				 <br> 					 <br> 0014	Tandum 20 Ton Transport to secondary stockpile 3 mile maximum.

<SUBJECT>SFC Controller Replacement
<SOLNBR>R15PS00013
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<CONTACT>Somerville, Amanda
<DESC>AMENDED - Notice of Intent

This is not a request for competitive proposals. The Bureau of Reclamation, Great Plains Region intends to award a furnish and install contract to ABB, Inc. for the replacement of the Static Frequency Converter Controller at the Mount Elbert Pumped-Storage Plant (MTE) located near Granite, Colorado. The ABB, Inc. (ABB) manufactured Static Frequency Converter (SFC) was installed by ABB in 1992. The controller portion of the SFC is now near the end of its life and the current model is no longer supported by ABB. ABB will replace the presently installed controller with a compatible programmable controller capable of operating the SFC used to start both 170,000HP pumps at MTE. The contractor will be responsible for installing, programming, commissioning, documenting, training, and supporting the controller.

Reclamation is procuring this requirement pursuant to Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Reclamation intends to award this contract during Fiscal Year 2015. Reclamation believes that ABB is the only source that can successfully furnish and install the SFC Controller due to experience, manufacturing capabilities, and proprietary software information. However, Reclamation will consider vendors that recognize they can fully provide the requirement can identify themselves in written notification to the Contract Specialist. Written notification of capability statements or proposals must be received by the Contract Specialist by 4 p.m. local time on January 5, 2015. Any information received from said vendors will be solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.

A Justification for Other Than Full and Open competition has been approved and will be made available on FedBizOpps and FedConnect within 14 days after contract award.

Questions can be directed to the Contract Specialist, Amanda Somerville, at 406-247-7797 or ASomerville@usbr.gov

<NTYPE>PRESOL
<RESPDATE>030215
<ARCHDATE>04012015
<CONTACT>BAA Coordinator, Email ACDC@darpa.mil
<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals to develop prototype systems for agnostic conversion of chemical warfare agents to inert material. Destroying bulk stores of Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs) and their organic precursors abroad is a significant challenge for the international community. Current approaches such as hydrolysis, incineration and supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) to process CWAs and precursor chemicals have a number of shortcomings: 1) they are not truly agnostic due to limitations with the chemistry and/or materials of construction; 2) due to their large size, they require transport of the agent from the storage site to the neutralization site;  and 3) approaches such as hydrolysis and SCWO require consumables (e.g., water), which must be supplied locally and produce significant amounts of hazardous waste that require further processing.  In the Agnostic Compact Demilitarization of Chemical Agents (ACDC) program, DARPA will develop new technologies to address these shortcomings. The overarching objective of ACDC is to realize a transportable, agnostic prototype system that converts =99.9999% of any halogenated or non-halogenated organic compound into constitutive oxides (e.g., SOx, POx, NOx) and stable alkaline or alkaline earth metal salts (or another demonstrated safe form) with minimal consumables and no hazardous waste output.

<a href="mailto:matthew.p.hancsarik@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Sacramento</a>
<DESC>Location   <br>   Folsom Dam is located at the confluence of the North and South Forks of the American   <br>   River, approximately 29 miles upstream from the city of Sacramento, near the town of Folsom, CA.  Sheet G-002 is a location, vicinity and site map of the Folsom Dam auxiliary spillway project.  The location of this bank stabilization work is on the right bank side of the American River about 1,000 feet downstream from the main dam (Sheet B-101).   <br>      <br>   Background   <br>   The convergence of flows from the main Folsom Dam and new auxiliary spillway could destabilize the existing slope where the flows converge.  After the auxiliary spillway becomes operational changes in river hydraulics downstream of the stilling basin will occur that have not been experienced to date.  Because of the orientation of the auxiliary spillway, an approximately 400 foot reach of the American River right bank area will become more vulnerable to erosion and scour.   <br>      <br>   Summary of Work   <br>   The primary objective of this project is to ensure the increment of the slope between about elevations 125 feet  and 160 feet  (NAVD 88) remains stable during future operations of the auxiliary spillway.  To achieve this, the lower bank slopes below about elevation 160 will be reinforced with 32' long, post tensioned, rock bolts based on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineer Manual (EM) 1110-1-2907.  Bolts will generally be installed on a 20-foot by 20-foot diamond pattern as shown on Sheet B-101; however, additional bolts may be installed at up to ten (10) locations at the direction of the Government.     <br>      <br>   In addition to the installation of rock bolts as described above, it is anticipated that some dental concrete may be required to fill reentrant joint cavities to prevent the potential dislodging of several large rock blocks in the vicinity of Sta. 14+90 (see Sheet B-101).     <br>      <br>   Site accessibility and the steep topography of the American River right bank site are a challenge to the planning, design and construction of the right bank stabilization effort.  The access ramp or temporary access route to the midslope work area will be steep with a grade as much as 30%.  Rock bolts will be installed on the lower vertical slopes and as such will require limited access drilling capability in order to install the bolts while suspended alongside the vertical slopes.   <br>      <br> Disclosure of Magnitude (FAR 36.204) is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. <br>  <br>  <br>   Desired Contractor Capabilities   <br>   USACE requests that interested contractors' demonstrate their capabilities to perform the Right Bank Stabilization effort as follows:   <br>    	Access to  ''wagon'' drills or other limited access drilling equipment   <br>    	Ability to work suspended over water by ropes, climbing harnesses, or a platform   <br>    	Ability to contain all drill cuttings and fluids while suspended over the river    <br>    	Ability to safely work with limited access and staging areas   <br>    	Ability to work in close proximity of protected habitat and protected species   <br>    	Limited construction duration (June 15 -  December 15; construction expected to be completed in 2015)   <br>      <br>   Information to be Submitted by Potential Contractors:  The Government is seeking sources with the above capabilities for the work outlined in the summary and provided drawings.  The Government will utilize the submitted information to determine the type of small business set aside for this acquisition.     <br>      <br>   Thus, contractors interested in this project should submit a statement of capabilities, of no more than 10 pages, that:   <br>    	States the contractors business size (small or large) and subcategory (i.e. 8A, HUBZone, Women Owned, etc.);    <br>    	Demonstrates the contractors experience and capability with similar types of work; and   <br>    	Outlines the types of and access to equipment that will be used in performance of the work.   <br>      <br>   Information received in response to this Sources Sought will help determine the Government's acquisition planning including but not limited to Socio-Economic Set Asides (i.e. Small Business or Large Business), solicitation method (i.e. Sealed Bid or Best Value Tradeoff), and Evaluation Criteria should the solicitation become a Best Value Tradeoff.   <br>      <br>   Statements of Capability are due to the Government no later than 1630 PST on Monday December 22, 2014.     <br>      <br>  Statements of Capability should be email to Mr. Matthew Hancsarik at matthew.p.hancsarik@usace.army.mil by the deadline presented above.  Acceptable formats for the submission include PDF and Word (.docx)  <br>

<DESC><p>The intent of this notice is for the USCG to provide all questions and answers as a direct result of the Sources Sought (HSCG44-14-R-TEITIS2), posted on November 20, 2014 (See Attached).<br /><br />Also, based on the questions received as a direct result of the posting of this Sources Sought, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Telecommunication and Information Systems Command (TISCOM) wants to make the commercial industry fully aware of 1) TISCOM's current IT support status, 2) TISCOM's need for interim support, and 3) TISCOM's future support requirements as follows:<br /><br />1) TISCOM's current IT support services are being performed under Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Eagle I IDIQ Contract HSHQDC-06-D-00024, Task Order HSCG23-09-J-TEITIS. The Period of Performance (POP) for these services will expire on February 16, 2015. These services are currently being performed by General Dynamics.<br /><br />2) Posting HSCG44-14-R-TIS001 to FedBizOps on April 02, 2014 was for procurement planning purposes for the needed follow on services of Task Order HSCG23-09-J-TEITIS. Note that the follow on PWS requirements are not totally identical in nature to the PWS requirements for HSCG23-09-J-TEITIS.<br /><br />3) TISCOM estimates that a time period of a 1 month Base and three 1 month Option Periods may be needed to allow TISCOM to complete the recompete process leading to award of the follow-on contract to Task Order HSCG23-09-J-TEITIS. The Sources Sought, HSCG44-14-R-TEITIS2, posted to FedBizOpps on November 20, 2014, is a necessary notice based on various Federal and DHA procurement regulations for the consideration of continuing services under Task Order HSCG23-09-J-TEITIS for a POP of 1 month Base and three 1 month Option Periods while TISCOM finalizes the recompete process.<br /><br />TISCOM will give due consideration to all responses to the Sources Sought before deciding whether to exercise the right to a logical follow on extension of the services to General Dynamics for the estimated needed POP of a 1 month Base and three 1 month Option Periods.</p>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 11,  John D. Dingell Medical Center
NCO 11, Ann Arbor is the contracting activity.  2237 number is 553-15-1-139-0015.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:    This is a sole source request for a new Firm-fixed price contract to Varian Medical.

3.	 Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  VARIAN will provide emergency and nonemergency service repairs/replacement to the TrueBeam (SN: H191582) & sub equipment, attachments, and software (as specified in Maintenance Agreement KMH20140422-001).    The referenced maintenance agreement is for the Varian Premier Assurance Essentials Maintenance Plan which carries a 97% up-time guarantee, mandatory upgrades coverage, Firmware and software upgrades coverage, comprehensive parts coverage, discounted labor rates etc.  It is a full service coverage plan.  Truebeam is a linear accelerator system used to provide treatment to cancer patients used in radiation.   A nine plus month contract (12/10/2014-9/30/2015)  (Est. $199,018.00)

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  

	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;


5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):     

Varian Medical Systems is the original equipment manufacturer.  Only Varian Medical Systems can perform the required maintenance and repairs to this equipment.   The vendor has access to their servers with a VA national agreement to access them via VPN communication which means that they are able to log into our servers remotely and be able to resolve any software issues as well as provide software upgrades and system diagnostics.  In addition, the software and hardware components make the system impossible to work on without manufacturer training and service keys.   Accordingly, Varian Medical is the only firm capable of providing the supplies and services described in Section 3 above without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition.



6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

Robert Hijazi searched GSA advantage.gov and the internet for applicable FSS contract or an open market contractor that could provide the services and supplies required and was unable to locate one.  The Contracting Officer issued a sources sought announcement on FBO on 9/19/2014 and only one source replied to date, Varian Medical.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:   The Contracting Officer will determine the price fair and reasonable through price analysis through comparison of the proposed contract price to other contract prices for the same or similar service plans prior to contract award.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Robert Hijazi searched GSA advantage.gov and the internet for applicable FSS contract or an open market contractor that could provide the services and supplies required and was unable to locate one.  He also obtained a quote from Varian Medical for the proposed services so that the VA would know exactly what was covered and what was not.  The Contracting Officer searched the internet and found no other vendors that could provide the services or supplies and contacted Varian Medical via phone and e-mail to verify whether the service plan was available on FSS or nott.  According to Ms. Cora Servanda, of Varian Medical, it is not available under any FSS contract.  The Contracting officer also issued a sources sought announcement on FBO on 9/19/2014 and only one source replied to date, Varian Medical.


9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:    N/A

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Varian Medical

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  				
The VA will research the market again prior to any future purchases for these services and supplies but plans to take no immediate action to overcome any barriers to competition at this point.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, 


which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
