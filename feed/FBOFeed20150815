<DESC>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government.  This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business or HUBZone small businesses capable of providing  following items: Optica Environmental Sensor.
<p>Human metabolic rate can be calculated from the rate at which a person consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. This can be measured in a specialized human metabolic chamber by measuring the changes in the concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the room air over time when the room is occupied by a human subject.  A number of on-going clinical protocols use the metabolic chamber as the primary tool to measure changes in human metabolism in response to various pharmaceutical agents, disease states, dietary interventions, or environmental conditions. A necessary condition for this measurement is consistent environmental conditions in and around the metabolic chamber. Currently, there are 3 GE Optica Sensors installed in metabolic chamber setup and they are necessary for monitoring the environmental conditions within the metabolic chamber. The sensors were purchased in 2007 and 2008, as the metabolic chambers were being constructed, and several are in need of replacement. We would like to purchase backup/replacement sensors in the event of failure due to overuse/age of the current sensors.</p>
<p>The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 334516 with a size standard of 500.  All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce and the NOAA Air Resources Laboratory in College Park, MD intend to award a purchase order to the University of Delaware School of Marine Sciences and Policy to service the Atmospheric Integrated Monitoring Network (AIRMoN) research site. In 1992, the Air Resources Laboratory began funding the (AIRMoN), a network designed to determine the effectiveness of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments in reducing deposition of various chemicals via atmospheric pathways and to address regional source-receptor issues. The wet deposition segment of the AIRMoN program is structured to answer many of the questions originally contemplated by MAP3S and mandated for NOAA to study as part of the Title IX of Clean Air Act Amendments. The University of Delaware station at Lewes, DE is a critical member of the A IRMoN precipitation network. In order to continue to generate useful data, the station must remain at the current location and must be managed by a competent operator who has unlimited access to the site. Moving the site would require at least one year of inter-comparison between the current site and the new site, followed by several months of data comparison and statistical comparison. A competent operator must follow all the approved protocols and be able to meet routine maintenance and troubleshooting requirements.
<p>Duties include:<br />1. Continue monitoring precipitation chemistry on a daily basis according to the methods<br />specified by the AIRMoN Central Analytical Laboratory in Champaign, Illinois. This<br />effort requires the following:</p>
<p>a. Maintenance of the AIRMoN station located at the University of Delaware of Marine<br />Science &amp; Policy, in Lewes, DE, according to the NADP Site Selection and <br />Installation Manual found at (http://nadp.sws .uiuc.edu/lib/archive/siteinst-a .pdf).</p>
<p>2. Operation of the Lewes, DE AIRMoN station according to the AIRMoN-wet site <br />operator's manual found at (http://www .isws.illinois.edu/pubdoc/MP / ISWSMP- <br />184.pdf).</p>
<p>a. Routine (at least weekly) maintenance of Aerochem Metris precipitation<br />chemistry collector and manual &amp; electronic precipitation gauges<br />b. Collection of all precipitation samp les on a daily basis, 365 days per year<br />c. Conductivity and pH analysis for all precip itation samples with greater than 50 ml volume<br />d. Packaging and shipping of samples according to NOAA AIRMoN protocols at least once per<br />week</p>
<p>In addition, operators shall be called upon to participate in AIRMoN program development efforts through telephone conference calls or formal meetings and to participate in special field studies and equipment testing programs.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541990. The proposed contract action is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source. This sources sought is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by closing date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; and a detailed capabilities statement.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Oceanic Atmospheric Research, intend to award a purchase order to the National Academy of Sciences to provide support (Base year and One Option Year) for the Roundtable on Risk, Resilience and Extreme Events (or Resilient America Roundtable, RAR). The Resilient America Roundtable convenes experts from the academic, public, and private sectors and undertakes one or more demonstration projects that catalyze or implement activities that build community resilience to extreme events at the local, regional, or national levels. The National Academy of Sciences is the only known entity conducting this particular project in conjunction with the key external stakeholders of major interest to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Groups currently engaged with the study include Carnegie Mellon University, the UPS Foundation, F.H. Best Associates, FEMA, Urban Resilience Strategies, Cargill Foundation, Georgia Institute of Technology, OH,. University of Maryland, USGS, Wharton Risk Center, Stanford University, US Chamber of Commerce Foundation, Dewberry, Virginia Tech. and more. Per Executive Order12832 of January 19, 1993, signed by President Bush. "When a department or agency of the executive branch of the Government determines that the Academy, because of its unique qualifications, is the only known source that can provide the measure of expertise, independence , objectivity, and audience acceptance necessary to meet the department's or agency's program requirements, acquisition of services by the Academy may be obtained on a noncompetitive basis if otherwise in accordance with applicable law and regulations." The Roundtable shall provide a venue for current research, science, and evidence-based foundations to inform whole community strategies for building resilience. The mission of the Resilient America Roundtable is to convene experts from the academic, NGOs, public, and private sectors to design or catalyze activities that build resilience to extreme events. These activities could be exercised by community, regional, national, or international partners. The Roundtable shall provide the venue for current research, science, and evidence-based foundations to inform whole community strategies for building resilience. Roundtable activities also help decision makers build approaches for deciding how and where to invest resources to mitigate risk and build resilience in ways that (1) allows them to explain or defend those investment decisions; and (2) it helps to shape a bigger picture of national resilience. The Roundtable shall engage decision makers at the community and local levels and use four mechanisms in its work: improving risk communication and behavior; identifying means to measure community resilience; developing mechanisms to share data and information related to hazards, disasters, risk, and resilience; and developing or strengthening partnerships and coalitions within and among communities to build resilience. The RAR has a two-year plan of action. In each of the two years, the Roundtable shall convene discussions and meetings on topics and activities selected by the Roundtable members and partners. These meetings shall include at least one annual, public workshop in Washington; the other meetings would be executive meetings of the Roundtable members, expert meetings, or other activities that take place in other US or international cities. The Roundtable shall provide a means for its members to engage with policymakers, federal agencies, legislative staff, local communities, or the private sector in relevant resilience discussions, activities or projects. As appropriate, workshop and meeting summaries, internal working documents or white papers, as well as other, non-written products, shall be the deliverables over the entire course of the program period. <br />The RAR shall facilitate several real-time community-based projects that mitigate risk or build community preparedness and resilience to floods, weather-related disasters, and other extreme events across the United States. These projects could take the form of: initiating or partnering with existing city-based resilience programs; providing a forum for stakeholders to identify, discuss, and analyze different community approaches to resilience in communities across the United States; enabling connections among resilience experts in the public, private, and NGO sectors within communities; or catalyzing other implementable projects. The Roundtable shall provide a productive outlet for programs and initiatives of NOAA. It shall offer opportunities for NOAA to leverage its ability to lead and coordinate national programs focused on risk, resilience, and extreme events. In addition, the Roundtable shall help further expand and strengthen NOAA's strong partnerships with federal agencies, research and academic groups, and/or the private sector.

All travel shall be approved, by the COTR, prior to commencement of travel. Consultant shall provide supporting documentation and a detailed breakdown of incurred travel costs with each invoice. 

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

In keeping with this designation, unclassified information related to USSOCOM military technology acquisitions managed by USSOCOM or any of its component commands, will be designated Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). As such, the contractor hereby unequivocally agrees that it shall not release to anyone outside the Contractor's organization any unclassified information, regardless of medium (e.g., film, tape, document, contractor's external website, newspaper, magazine, journal, corporate annual report, etc.), pertaining to any part of this contract or any program related to this contract, unless the Contracting Officer has given prior written approval.

<DESC><p>Official Solicitation:<br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in<br />subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6 is being utilized in conjunction with FAR 13.</p>
<p>Solicitation number HSHQDC-15-R-00148 is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) by the Office of Procurement Operations (OPO) on behalf of the Office of Health Affairs (OHA), National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC).</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a contract entitled "Biosurveillance Real-Time Data Feed" as a result of this solicitation. The contract will be awarded as a Firm Fixed Price contract.</p>
<p>The contract will have a base period of performance of twelve (12) months and four (4), twelve-month optional periods.</p>
<p>The objective of the contract is to provide a real-time data feed that supports biosurveillance across multiple domains (e.g., human health, animal health, etc.). To advance its mission, NBIC requires a real-time data feed product for use in biosurveillance. Product may include, but is not limited to, data feeds that aggregate open source information from news media, forums, blogs, and other publicly available sources providing relevant biosurveillance information. Specific requirements and deliverable schedules are outlined in the SOW, Attachment 1.</p>
<p>The evaluation of proposals will be based on the following criteria listed in descending order of importance:<br />(1) Technical Approach and Understanding (Rated)<br />(2) Management Approach and Capabilities (Rated)<br />(3) Past Performance (Rated)<br />(4) Price (Non-rated)</p>
<p>Evaluation factors (1), (2), and (3) are all of equal weight, and when combined, are significantly more important than evaluation criterion (4). Award may be made to other than the offeror that submitted the lowest priced proposal if the Government determines that a higher price is warranted due to greater technical merit. As the technical evaluations become more equal, price becomes more important in making the award determination. In the event that two or more proposals are determined to have no substantial technical differences (i.e., are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced proposal.</p>
<p>Awards may also be made on the basis of initial proposals without clarifications or further interactions. As such, initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms and Firm Fixed Price.</p>
<p>All proposals shall include a completed copy of 52.212-3 "Offeror Representations and Certifications -<br />Commercial Items (Mar 2015)".</p>
<p>See Section I - Contract Clauses, for applicable clauses.</p>
<p>The due date for response to this RFP at the addresses specified below is on or before August 24, 2015, 10:00 AM Eastern. Each volume shall be clearly marked by Volume Number and Title. It is the responsibility of the Offeror to get their submission in on time and ensure successful delivery to the Government. Submission shall be via e-mail to Contracting Officer, Carla Davis at Carla.Davis@hq.dhs.gov and Contract Specialist, Charnelle Brown at charnelle.brown@hq.dhs.gov.</p>
<p>Offerors must submit questions concerning this solicitation in writing by e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Carla Davis at Carla.Davis@hq.dhs.gov and Contract Specialist, Charnelle Brown at charnelle.brown@hq.dhs.gov. All questions must be submitted via e-mail, and received no later than August 18, 2015, 10:00 AM Eastern. Responses to questions will be posted as an amendment to this solicitation no later than August 19, 2015, 10:00 AM Eastern. Please be advised that the Government reserves the right to transmit those questions and answers of a common interest to all prospective Offerors. The Offeror or source of the question will not be referenced when issuing an amendment to the solicitation.</p>
