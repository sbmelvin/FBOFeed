<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). This solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-58. The NAICS code is 423830. The following commercial item is requested:

CLIN 0001:	Right-hand drive Truck Maintenance: Line Construction 4x4 for U.S. Army Garrison, Japan, in accordance with attached specifications.

Quantity:	1

Delivery to:	USAG-J Torii Station, DPW, Okinawa, Japan

The item under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Purchase Agreement.
 The contract requirements for the requested item are outlined in Attachment 1 – Vehicle Specifications.

The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price related factors considered.  Technical capability and past performance are of equal importance and, when combined, are approximately equal to price.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate the proposals:

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

Factor 1, Technical Capability of the Item Offered 

Solicitation Submittal Requirements:  Technical proposal shall be submitted separate from price proposal.
 Technical proposal shall be submitted in hard copy – one (1) original and one (1) copy – and include:

(1) A list of deviations from specifications, if any, submitted on Deviation form (Attachment 2, Tab 2);

(2) Two (2) sets of catalogue(s) or other product literature identifying the features and specifications of each vehicle offered.

Basis of Evaluation:  Overall compliance of the item offered with the stated specifications, including terms and conditions of warranty offered and the offeror’s ability to meet the required delivery date as stated in the solicitation.

Factor 2, Past Performance

Solicitation Submittal Requirements:  Provide a list of up to three (3) contracts similar in size and complexity of this solicitation completed during the past 3 years from date of this solicitation.
 Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers.  Provide the information on Exhibit A for each contract.

IF A COMPLETED CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM
(CPARS) EVALUATION IS AVAILABLE, IT SHALL BE SUBMITTED WITH THE PROPOSAL.
IF THERE IS NOT A COMPLETED CPARS EVALUATION, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ), included in the solicitation is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes in its proposal for Factor 2, Past Performance. AN OFFEROR SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS IS AVAILABLE.

IF A CPARS EVALUATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.
  Completed PPQs should be submitted with your proposal.  If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing date, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ (Exhibit A), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).  Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.  If the client requests, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government’s points of contact, Janeen Bais, Contract Specialist, via email at janeen.bais@fe.navy.mil and Carla Echols, Contract Specialist, via email at carloso.echols@fe.navy.mil prior to proposal closing date.
  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their proposal PPQs or CPARS previously submitted for other RFPs.  However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation.

Also include performance recognition documents received within the last two years from date of this solicitation such as awards, award fee determinations, customer letters of commendation, and any other forms of performance recognition. 

In addition to the above, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance.  Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture, teaming arrangement, or parent company/subsidiary/affiliate) identified in the offeror’s proposal, inquiries of owner representative(s), and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.
  

While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the offeror.

In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)).  Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance, and will receive an Unknown Confidence (Neutral) rating for this factor.  Any offeror’s proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated Unknown Confidence (Neutral), may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may not be competitive when compared to proposals of other offerors.

Basis of Evaluation:  The degree to which past performance evaluations and all other past performance information reviewed by the Government (e.g., PPIRS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), performance recognition documents, and information obtained for any other source) reflect a trend of satisfactory performance considering:

	- A pattern of successful completion of projects / contracts; 
	- A pattern of deliverables that are timely and of good quality; and in conformance with applicable law and industry standards;
	- A pattern of cooperativeness and teamwork with the Government at all levels (task managers, contracting officers, auditors, etc.);
	- Projects / contracts that are identical to, similar to, or related to the project / solicitation  task at hand; and
	- A respect for stewardship of Government funds.

Ratings obtained from PPQs submitted shall be evaluated as follows:

	- Exceptional (E) and Very Good (VG) shall be assigned a rating of “Substantial Confidence”;
	- Satisfactory (S) shall be assigned a rating of “Satisfactory Confidence”;
	- Marginal (M) shall be assigned a rating of “Limited Confidence”;
	- Unsatisfactory (U) shall be assigned a rating of “No Confidence”; and
	- Not Applicable (N) shall be assigned a rating of “Unknown Confidence (Neutral)”.

Factor 3, Price

Solicitation Submittal Requirements:  Price proposal shall be submitted separate from technical proposal and priced in Japanese Yen ONLY (use exchange rate of ¥75/$1).
 Price proposal shall be submitted in hard copy – one (1) original and one (1) copy – and include:

(1) Price Proposal form (Attachment 2, Tab 1) with all highlighted blocks completed. Offered manufacturer’s name/model number and proposed delivery date shall be stated;

(2) Period for Acceptance: Proposals shall indicate that prices are valid for a minimum period of ninety (90) days;

(3) Representations and Certifications, and Other Statements of Offerors (Attachment 3) with all representations and certifications executed;

(4) Latest Financial Report;

(5) One (1) electronic copy of Price Proposal, Technical Proposal and Catalogue(s), submitted as one document on CD in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF).

Basis of Evaluation:  The Government will evaluate price based on the total price.
  Total price consists of the basic requirements and all option items.  Analysis will be performed by one or more of the following techniques to ensure a fair and reasonable price:

(1) Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the RFP.

(2) Comparison of proposed prices with the IGCE.

(3) Comparison of proposed prices with available historical information.

(4) Comparison of market survey results.

A price that is found to be either unreasonably high or unrealistically low in relation to the proposed work may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in the overall proposal being considered unacceptable.
