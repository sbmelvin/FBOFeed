<DESC><p>Through the Focused Long Term Challenge (FLTC) process AFRL has established high level goals for future space access systems. These goals relate to cost, reliability, availability, and responsiveness. The AFRL has identified mid-term (15 years out) goals of 24 hour turn around, 10X lower ops cost, 0.999 vehicle reliability, 95% all weather reliability, 500 sortie airframe, 250 sortie propulsion and systems and far term (25 years out) goals of 4 hour turn around, 100X lower ops cost, 0.9998 vehicle reliability, 98% all weather reliability, 1000 sortie airframe, 500 sortie propulsion and systems.
<p>This BAA is targeting technologies that help advance toward the mid and far-term goals listed above. Specifically, this BAA seeks to develop and mature ceramic matrix composite (CMC) thermal protection systems (TPS) for future reusable space access vehicles.</p>
<p>The high level goals described above have implications for a CMC TPS. The CMC materials must be durable. They must be resistant to environmental degradation, oxidation and impact damage. They must be waterproof (i.e. to enable rapid vehicle turn-around, elimination of TPS re-waterproofing is crucial).</p>
<p>This solicitation will consider the full range of ceramic matrix composites including SiC/SiC, C/SiC, oxide/oxide and others. The offeror should propose a material system(s) and present arguments to support their proposed material system(s.</p>
<p>This is a materials development and maturation effort. This solicitation is not targeting a specific vehicle or a specific flight profile. Ideally the CMC TPS will be broadly applicable to a range of vehicles. TPS that is potentially applicable to both stages of a two stage reusable launch vehicle is desirable.</p>

<DESC><p>The AF Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/RXM) is interested in identifying potential manufacturing improvement programs that significantly impact cost, schedule, or availability of Air Force weapon systems. In this case the focus is on the manufacture of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) with specific emphasis on unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). Manufacturing improvement programs ultimately lead to advanced manufacturing processes, techniques &amp; systems that enable timely, reliable, high quality, economical production and sustainment of Air Force weapon systems. Manufacturing improvements to ground stations, training systems, datalinks or exploitation techniques (generally software focused), are not the focus of this manufacturing improvement BAA.</p>

<p>In order to ensure preparedness and competency with LRN procedures, LRN Member Laboratories must participate in the Proficiency Testing (PT) Program provided by LRB. The LRN PT Program is designed to simulate real-world scenarios involving potential bioterrorism agents; requiring the preparation, packaging, and distribution of prepared biological samples in a variety of sample matrices. LRN PT challenges are distributed one to four times a year to as many as 200 LRN member laboratories.&nbsp;&nbsp; The LRB and associated Bioterrorism Rapid Response and Advanced Technology (BRRAT) Laboratory do not have the capacity or production capabilities to produce sufficient sample quantities to meet LRN PT Challenge requirements.&nbsp; Therefore, the purpose of this procurement is to obtain services from a qualified&nbsp;contractor to produce and distribute samples for a limited number of LRN Proficiency Testing challenges for biological threat agents.&nbsp;</p>

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of the Department of the Under Secretary of Defense - Quality of Life Office, the Department of Defense (DoD) requires a contractor to provide services in support of the Military and Family Counseling Services/Military Community and Family Policy.  This program develops, administers and monitors the establishment of a non-medical counseling program for military Service members and their families at locations worldwide.  The non-medical counseling support is intended to augment existing military and civilian support services but is not to replace Service funded staff positions.
This effort represents a follow-on requirement to DOI/NBCAQD contract number 1406-04-07-CT-66523.

BACKGROUND
The Global War on Terror has resulted in an unprecedented level of deployments of American military personnel to Iraq, Afghanistan and other international areas of extreme conflict.  These deployments into harm's way, which are viewed nightly on national television, have placed extreme stress on military families.  Stress on marriages is at unprecedented levels and divorce rates, particularly in the Army, are at all time highs.  Military families are struggling to balance complex and competing demands requiring a wide range of problem solving skills:  being a single parent; communications; child care; financial stability; spouse employment; fluctuating family income; frequent relocations; isolation from other extended families, children's education, etc.  The Department of Defense recognizes that families also serve and is committed to supporting military families.  
The Department intends to make short term, situational, problem-solving counseling services available to Service members and families world-wide as needed.  This non-medical counseling is designed to help Service members and their families cope with the normal reactions to the stressful/adverse situations created by deployments.  Situations meeting the diagnostic criteria for the most common mental disorders found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) will be referred to TRICARE or other providers of professional mental health care.  With the exception of mandatory state, federal and military reporting requirements (i.e., domestic violence, child abuse, and duty to warn situations) this problem-solving counseling will be private and confidential to encourage the widest level of participation.  This Military and Family Life Counseling Service fills a widely recognized need for private counseling services.  

OBJECTIVE
The counseling program will consist of an as needed, short-term, situational, problem-solving counseling service for Service members and families that addresses the stressors of the military lifestyle. The counseling service will assist Service members and families in dealing with relationships, crisis intervention, stress management, family issues, parent-child communications, family separations, reunions and reintegration due to deployments.  The counseling service will also assist military members and families volunteering their support for military communities and families (i.e., Family Readiness Group Leaders, Family Support Volunteers).  	There will be four systems of counseling service delivery.  The scope of care for all four systems of delivery will cover only DSM-IV V-Codes.  	1)	Outreach/Rotational: Counseling services may be delivered by counselors enrolled in the contractor's network of providers.  Service delivery will be provided both on and off the military installations within the civilian community, but it will not be provided in military Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF). Counseling services will consist of face-to-face counseling, outreach/awareness services, and educational services provided on a short-term rotational basis to meet the need.  Contractor will provide rotational (not to exceed 90 days) counseling staff for a minimum of 84 military installations/locations world-wide.  The 84 installations include all 4 military services located in the Continental United States (CONUS) and overseas (OCONUS) and specific National Guard and Reserve Component locations (see Attachment 1 for a list of locations). The staff will be sent in teams of two counselors/consultants based on the needs of the installation/location specifically around the schedule of deployments, redeployments and return/reintegration of the Service members.   The Contractor shall develop protocols for assessing need at the installation and plan for rotation that is understood by the Service.  Installations also need to be briefed on the outset that these services are to augment existing services and meet the need of all families.  Outreach/rotational counseling may also include short-term specialized programs such as the Department of Defense Education Activity and Child and Youth Program Summer Enrichment Program which operates during the summer months to support summer school, camps, and summer child and youth programs DoD-wide. The summer program counseling staff and any specialized short-term services may be sent individually rather than in a team of two. The outreach/rotational counseling services are expected to be approximately 60% of the contract. Travel, per diem and lodging will be covered for counselors/consultants living 50 miles outside of the installation where they are working.
2)	Fulltime: Counseling services delivered by full-time counselors hired by the contractor and placed on the military installation in a social service delivery program (i.e., Family Centers, Chaplains, Child or Youth Center).  The counselors providing full-time services may be credentialed by government personnel in addition to the contractor credentialing process and depends upon specific service needs and regulatory guidance.  Counselors may keep written records of counseling sessions as appropriate in accordance with service requirements.  Fulltime counseling positions may include specific pilot initiatives which may be time limited, but should not be filled with rotational staff. Fulltime positions are primarily staffed with clinical providers.  A small percentage is staffed with Personal Financial Counselors (PFM) with specific skills related to finance.  Fulltime counseling services are expected to be approximately 20% or less of the contract.  3)	On-Demand: Non-medical counseling support and psycho-educational presentations on a variety of topics focused on deployment and reintegration, communication, and grief and loss and is primarily for drill weekends and family events for the National Guard and Reserve Component.  Counseling support is requested through the military Service HQ to the contractor and OSD.  On-demand events include support for Service members and family members to include activities for children. A contractor call center for this on-demand service is recommended for commands to call to request services ensuring consultants are available to attend this primarily weekend events. On-demand support must be requested a minimum of 7 days in advance for the contractor to meet staffing and travel requirements. On-Demand services are expected to be approximately 15% of the contract. 
4)	Counseling Referrals: Counseling referrals to a network of providers for 1-6 sessions is offered within 30 minutes of the individual requesting service primarily targeted for National Guard and Reserve Component members and their families. Counseling referrals are expected to be approximately 5% or less of the contract.  These referrals shall be provided to families via a telephone hotline which can be accessed 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, year round.   The contractor shall maintain complete call logs for each call, and complete documentation of the referral, including the number of visits utilized (maximum of six per individual), cost, service provider and dates of service.  Costs of referred services shall be tracked and invoiced on a cost reimbursable basis.

Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the offer to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  
(d)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 
PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. 
Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:
NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.
OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance.
SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.
MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

(f)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design controlactivity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique designcapability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualifiedsource(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). Theapproved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technicaldata that are not economically available to the Government, and the data orknowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternatesource must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualificationprocedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity havingjurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requiresGovernment source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flightcritical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate tosupport acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previouslyapproved by the government for this item have been solicited.

Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the SourceApproval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by theSource Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under thissolicitation.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 611699   The US EPA/OCEFT/CID/Homeland Security Division (HSD), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 19 Small Business Programs, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Hyperion LegionInternational, LLC for Tactical Rifle I and Tactical Convoy Operations II courses, weapons rental, Rifle Range Rental/Instructors and Classrooms Rental.  The justification is as follows.  
Hyperion Legion International (HLI) has provided training to HSD in the past and is familiar with the specific training requirements required for HSD to expeditiously and safely fulfill HSD's force protection/personnel security mission.  HSD knows of no other source of training that can provide the required components with qualified instructors and the associated infrastructure (i.e. classrooms, shooting ranges, firearms, etc.).  Additionally, HSD knows of no other source of training that can provide the required components with qualified instructors and the associated infrastructure (i.e. classrooms, shooting ranges firearms, etc.) and have the ability to do delivery within the timeframe required by HSD.  Due to the exigencies of the government's business, HSD requires initial and recurrent training to commence as soon as possible with the various weapons systems.  Proper training with the HSD duty weapon, the M-4 carbine and 870 shotguns are critical to the safety and security of the Special Agent in the field, his/her protectees and the public, and substantially reduces the liability to the Agency.  HSD requires training of its staff in advanced methods utilized in force protection/personnel security to be able to expeditiously and safely fulfill its mission pursuant to the Agency's Homeland Security Strategy; the National Response Framework and Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD) 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10.
Furthermore, under the auspices of FAR subpart 19.1406, HLI is a service-disabled veteran owned small business source.  HSD knows of no other service-disabled veteran owned small business source of training that can provide the required training with qualified instructors and the associated infrastructure (i.e. classrooms, shooting ranges firearms, etc.) and have the ability to do deliver within the timeframe required by HSD.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the contracting officer at daniels.ryan@epa.gov.

<DESC>In support of Naval S&T Focus Areas identified in the Naval S&T Strategic Plan, ONR is interested in receiving proposals on the use of innovative material concepts, engine components and integrated propulsion system technologies for highly reliable, low-cost, advanced gas turbine engines and propulsion systems that are significantly lighter, more powerful, more fuel efficient and that offer an overall higher capability than state-of-the-art propulsion systems.  Specifically, ONR is committing resources to develop and validate the technologies up to and including a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6.   The development, maturation, integration and transition of these advanced technologies into legacy, emerging, and potential future Naval aviation systems will significantly enhance Warfighter capability, flexibility and readiness with a substantial reduction in acquisition, support, and life cycle costs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT SEEKS EXPRESSION OF INTEREST
FOR OFFICE SPACE IN CAPE GIRARDEAU, MISSOURI


Requirement:  

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 3,299 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 2,869 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet.  The lease term requirement is for ten (10) years.  The space must be available for occupancy by June 1, 2009.  The delineated area is within the city limits of Cape Girardeau, Missouri.

Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:

	Within six (6) blocks of amenities (restaurants, hotels, etc.)
	Accessibility to the general public

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost/benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.  

Please send expressions of interest to:

Shari Ertz, Realty Specialist
General Services Administration
1500 E. Bannister Road
Room 2211-6PRE
Telephone:  816-823-5791
Fax:  816-926-3571
Email:  shari.ertz@gsa.gov


Expressions of Interest must be submitted to the above address by 5:00 PM on January 23, 2009, and must include the following information:
	Building name and address and location of the available space within the building.
	Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.
	ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced.  Indicate whether or not the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.
	Date of space availability.
	Method of rentable space measurement.
	Building Ownership Information.
	Amount of parking available on-site and its cost  include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).
	List of building services provided.

The Governments decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.  

This is an expression of interest for space only, not an invitation to bid.  Responses by other than the owner or manager of a property must include written permission of the owners of the space.

<DESC>Note: The previous announcement/notice on this subject published at www.fbo.gov 11/2007 (#CBP-IC-2008-1) with subsequent modifications is canceled and superseded by the notice that follows. 

INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR/SUBJECT-MATTER EXPERT (SME). Background: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous international training and assistance programs in various countries throughout the world which address the entire range of customs and border control operations. To effectively implement these programs, CBP requires the services of skilled and knowledgeable individuals (i.e., contractors) on an intermittent (short-term) basis. Short-term or intermittent is defined as a single assignment for 180 calendar days or less. Intermittent Contractors (ICs) will be required to perform various tasks such as those associated with training, utilizing specialized equipment, or to provide professional and technical assistance in specific topical areas. The following is a delineation of the types of general services that ICs are expected to provide under their contracts, as required. A more specific description of services or tasks shall be identified and provided to the ICs upon selection and award of an order/contract. 

Note: While some elements of performance under an order/contract may be performed in the United States (such as but not limited to meeting with program officials in Washington, DC or in other locales, telephonic and/or email correspondence, etc.), performance is primarily overseas.
       
TRAINING: The IC may be required to present customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum. The IC shall serve as a subject matter expert and/or presenter. Instruction may include, but is not limited to, the areas of narcotics interdiction, port security, customs investigative techniques, money laundering, intellectual property rights, control of weapons of mass destruction, commercial import/export operations, or customs valuation. In general, the topic and contents of the course will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction.

COURSE DEVELOPER: The IC may be required to develop a set of course materials on a given topic for later presentation by either CBP personnel or in-country advisors, as required. Courses to be developed could be in any customs or border control-related areas such as those described for TRAINING above. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training in course development for one or more related areas.

ASSESSMENTS: The IC may conduct on-site assessments of customs administrations and other border control agencies located in foreign countries, as required. Assessments may be general in scope or geared to specific areas (e.g., control of weapons of mass destruction, assessment of aviation equipment assets or of aviation programs, intellectual property rights, etc.). Tasks could include such actions as physical border surveys, and broader surveys of the entire governmental enforcement system. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the necessary experience and skills to complete an authoritative and professional review of the specific agencies or programs, and to prepare summaries, analyses, recommendations, trip reports, and/or other written work product(s).

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as legal reform, inspectional technology (high and low tech), port security, or specialized field operations. For example, in the area of legal reform, tasks may include the review of customs laws and regulations of a country, making recommendations for improvements, and/or providing technical assistance in the preparation of new laws and regulations that meet the needs of a specific country. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess specialized knowledge, experience, and background related to specific areas of expertise.

AUGMENTATION and REPLACEMENT: The IC may augment a technical team or temporarily replace a technical team member. As an additional team member, the IC will undertake general or specific tasks associated with various projects such as the development of an interagency taskforce or the review of personnel policies. As a replacement or fill-in, the IC may replace and assume the tasks of a technical team member who may be away from post for an extended period of time. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills to serve as an additional team member, or replacement member.

TERMS and CONDITIONS: It is not envisioned that an IC would be on duty more than 180 days in a 12 month (consecutive) period. Most IC assignments will be less than 30 days, with adequate advance notice given prior to assignment/deployment, while some IC assignments may last up to the full 180 calendar days. In the event that a requirement must be extended beyond the 180 day period, a modification will be issued on a bilateral basis for such extension. ICs should note that international travel may occur on more than one occasion for a given order. If an IC declines more than two assignments, he or she may be excluded from further consideration at the discretion of CBP. 

POSSIBLE DUTY LOCATIONS: ICs must be willing and able to work in any country in which CBP conducts operations. CBP training and assistance projects are currently ongoing in all regions of the world.

COMPENSATION and OTHER REIMBURSEMENTS: 1) ICs will be compensated for their performance on a fixed-priced basis at the rate of $2,400.00 per week for all ICs or prorating thereof (i.e., $480.00/day, $60.00/hour), for the period of time estimated by CBP for completion of the assignment, excluding travel days. 2) All authorized hours worked will be paid at the above hourly rate. 3) There are no provisions for an overtime or premium rate. Work is generally to be performed during the normal workweek however, the Contractor may work on weekends and be compensated at normal hourly rate (i.e., $60.00) with the express authorization of the Contracting Officer and/or Program Manager. 
 
OTHER REQUIREMENTS: 1) Prospective ICs may be required to undergo updated background investigations to obtain a SECRET security clearance from CBP. If for some reason a clearance cannot be granted, the prospective IC may be excluded from consideration from any assignments calling for such clearances. 2) For some specific assignments, foreign language ability may be a requirement for selection. 3) All materials provided to or developed by the IC under a contract are the property of CBP, may not be released to any other party without express permission from CBP, and are subject to return to CBP upon conclusion of the contract (or sooner upon receipt of a request from CBP).

TRAVEL: All travel will be under U.S. Government travel orders (separate and apart from the contract) and in accordance with applicable U.S. Government travel regulations. ICs will be reimbursed for all official travel upon completion of a travel voucher in accordance with an approved travel authorization. The IC will be responsible for purchasing airline or other common carrier tickets subsequent to approval of travel. ICs are not authorized to receive an advance for expenses for lodging, meals and/or travel incidentals. The embassy will be making travel arrangements in country. Travel time to and from the United States (and within the United States) is not compensable for pay purposes. 

CONSIDERATION of APPLICANTS: Both individuals and organizations are welcome to apply. Applications are to be submitted on an individual basis (one for each proposed IC applicant/person). Interested parties are to submit their qualifications in resume format, to be accompanied by a completed CBP - QUESTIONNAIRE FOR INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR available at FedBizOpps (accompanies this Notice). Beginning with the date of this notice, all applicants must submit the most recent revision of the questionnaire (currently Rev 8-07) in order to be considered.

In order to ensure that full consideration is given, applicants are encouraged to review the form OF-612, available at    http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of612.pdf. A copy of the 6/2006 version available at the above website at the time this notice was published is also available at FedBizOpps. Applicants are encouraged to review the information and topics covered on the OF-612 form and ensure that their resumes contain the same data elements that appear in that form. Applicants should NOT use the form OF-612 for the purpose of submitting an application, however.

Resume packages (i.e., resume & completed questionnaire) will be accepted by e-mail only. 

INTERESTED APPLICANTS ARE TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS AND RELATING DOCUMENTS TO: 

CBPIC@cbp.dhs.gov 

DO NOT SUBMIT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICE STAFF. A representative of the designated receiving office (above) will acknowledge receipt of applications via email within 5 business days of receipt. If no acknowledgement is received within 5 business days after transmitting, applicants are encouraged to follow up by sending an email inquiry to the email address above to ensure receipt of their applications. 

NOTE: Applicants who applied under a previous notice/announcement are encouraged to submit new application packages in accordance with the guidance and requirements herein, to include a completed questionnaire.

METHOD of SELECTION/OPERATION, INSURANCE and PHYSICAL EXAM REQUIREMENTS: The CBP Office of International Affairs will evaluate the resume and questionnaire packages received for technical ability. CBP may exclude any applicant from consideration if it is unable to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of his/her qualifications from the documents submitted. Qualified and otherwise acceptable candidates will then be added to a Qualified Bidders List from which ICs are selected and may be awarded an order/contract for one or more assignments in the future as needs arise. Prospective ICs must be physically fit, able to perform the duties of an assignment and may be required to obtain a physical examination and certification that they are fit for travel anywhere in the world for assignments up to 180 calendar days. If selected for a contract award and CBP elects to require that the prospective IC obtain a physical, CBP will reimburse the IC for reasonable actual costs (not to exceed $500.00) by including this item on the order/contract, as described above. 

ICs are required to obtain emergency evacuation insurance coverage when traveling to foreign locations. The order/contract document will provide for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs for this coverage (not to exceed $500.00). In situations where an IC currently has emergency evacuation insurance coverage in place which will extend through the period of proposed performance, new coverage need not be obtained. In such cases, the IC must present written proof of coverage to the officer making the inquiry as to availability before an order will be placed.

REQUIRED REGISTRATION @ WWW.CCR.GOV: Prospective ICs must be registered and have ACTIVE status in the government CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR) system at www.ccr.gov prior to issuance of an order/contract. CBP strongly recommends that applicants complete their registration as soon as possible after submitting an application. The process involves input of business information and registration with Dun and Bradstreet to obtain a D&B number. Applicants must include their D&B/DUNs # on the questionnaire (see above). 

NOTE: Applicants must follow up this process aggressively to ensure that ACTIVE status is attained. Registration data is valid for one year and must be updated at time of expiration in order for status to remain ACTIVE.

ORDER/CONTRACT DOCUMENT, COMMENCEMENT OF PERFORMANCE, ORDER CEILING: Once CBP identifies a requirement and selects a prospective IC, a CBP officer will contact the applicant and inquire as to availability for an assignment. If the selected applicant is available, a CBP Contracting Officer will prepare a suitable order/contract document in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (i.e., FAR, viewable at http://www.acqnet.gov/far/). The order/contract will be in the form of a Labor Hours type contract awarded in accordance with FAR 16.602 and the document will contain the detailed statement of work for the specific assignment, including services required, estimated time required, country/destination, travel dates, materials and topics to be addressed, and other applicable information. The Contracting Officer will submit the completed order/contract document to the selected IC for review, concurrence, and acceptance. The order will become a legal binding contract once the Contracting Officer receives written acceptance from the IC. The duration of contract performance shown on the contract document and resulting dollar amount constitutes a ceiling, beyond which the IC performs at his/her own risk. If needs arise which call for the IC to provide services for an additional period of time, the Contracting Officer will issue a modification which provides necessary funding and authorization for continued performance within specified limits.

ORDER/CONTRACT INVOICING and PAYMENTS: Payments are processed by CBP in arrears, in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act as implemented by FAR clause 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, with its Alternate 1.  ICs are to submit an invoice for services rendered under their contract no more frequently than once per month (in arrears), unless otherwise specifically authorized in the order/contract document. It is suggested that ICs submit their monthly invoice during the first week of each calendar month for services performed during the previous calendar month. IC monthly invoices must comply with the requirements of FAR 32.905. Travel-related reimbursements are handled separately in accordance with applicable travel regulations as indicated in the text above.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS: All taxes (federal, state and/or local) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) income reporting requirements are the responsibility of the IC as a 1099 type vendor. 

CONTRACTOR - MISSION RELATIONSHIPS, CONDUCT:
(a) The Contractor acknowledges that any resulting order/contract is an important part of the U.S. Foreign Assistance Program and agrees that his/her duties will be carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate with the responsibilities, which this entails.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; There is no solicitation available at this time.  No responses will be provided for request for a solicitation.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks potential sources concerning bulk neutralization of chemical and biological (CB) agents in storage with unique conventional weapon payloads.  The Government will use the responses to this Sources Sought Notice to possibly plan and conduct research and development of one or more candidate concepts as a technology demonstration project.

The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to solicit information on new and innovative conventional weapon technology ideas and concepts that can neutralize (e.g., kill or decompose) large quantities of containerized CB warfare agents with no or minimal intentional release, significantly reducing collateral effects.  This type of capability is envisioned to directly transfer the neutralizing energy, environment, or materials into the containers negating the need to intentionally release agents.

Note that ionizing radiation technologies for bulk neutralization have shown promise in this area, but are beset with potential political and legal issues, and may create further collateral damage concerns.  Consequently, alternative conventional technologies are sought that can neutralize large quantities and a wide variety of CB agents, and can easily be integrated into weapon systems.  Possible ideas have included but are not limited to energy storage materials/devices and long-term combustion systems/cycles.

Proposed technologies must satisfy the criteria below to be considered within the scope of this Sources Sought Notice.

1.The proposed technology or concept does not rely on nuclear or atomic energy to produce its neutralization environment and effects.  
2. The proposed technology or concept must attempt to minimize the release of viable CB agents during and following a weapon attack.
3. Describes the underlying theory of the technology and its effect(s), and proposed concept(s) of operations.
4. The proposed technology or concept has potential to be incorporated into existing or near-term inventory weapons configurations.  Modifications to current weapons configurations are permitted within reason.
5. The proposed technology or concept does not violate any existing domestic and international laws, policies, or treaties. 

GOVERNMENT INFORMATION

DTRA uses service contractors in fulfilling its mission requirements, including the review of the technology capabilities solicited in this Sources Sought Notice.  Service contracts contain an organizational conflict of interest clause that requires service contractors to protect the data, and prohibits them from using the data for any purpose other than that for which it was presented.

This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered as a Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  This Sources Sought Notice does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs of charges by the Government will arise due to contractor submission of responses to this Sources Sought Notice or the Government's use of such information.  

The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this Sources Sought Notice.  The information you provide will be used by the Department of Defense in determining whether it is feasible to conduct research and development of one or more technologies, and in selecting the method(s) for subsequently testing and demonstrating concept(s).

Funds have been appropriated and received for the express purpose of performing research and development of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Defeat technologies.  The Government does not plan to award a contract at this time, based solely on the responses from this Sources Sought Notice.  Near-term research may be pursued via a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) RFP, or other appropriate means.  

Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights.  However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately.  

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a formal RFP, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government.  All information contained in this Source Sought Notice is preliminary, and subject to modification.

RESPONSES

Responses should include information about all relevant and applicable technologies available within the aforementioned timeframes and based on requested criteria.  They should include information as described in requirement criteria.  Respondents should also include company size and applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes.

Responses should be single-spaced, 12-point font, with numbered pages, and should not exceed 25 pages in length, including cover page, appendices, tables, and figures.

Electronic submissions should use the following subject heading:  Bulk Neutralization R&D Candidate.  These submissions must be properly marked, and sent to the following e-mail addresses:  jerry.fairchild@dtra.mil and ronald.mccreary@dtra.mil.  

Paper responses should be properly marked and hand-carried or mailed to the following address:

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide:

Scientific, technical and operational support to enable the Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to fulfill its regulatory responsibilities as sponsor of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) and to assist DAIDS staff in arranging provisions of investigational drug and vaccine products for clinical trials by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

The information from this market research will help the NIAID, DAIDS plan their acquisition strategy.  Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.

THIS IS STRICLY MARKET RESEARCH.  NIAID/DAIDS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.

BACKGROUND

The mission of DAIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health (NIH), is to bring an end to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of HIV, supporting the advancement of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supporting the development of HIV/AIDS vaccines and other prevention measures.  This mission is carried out by four major programs within the Division: the Basic Sciences Program, the Therapeutics Research Program, the Vaccine Research Program and the Prevention Sciences Program.  In conjunction with these programs and through a variety of grants and contracts, NIAID/DAIDS sponsors Phase I, II, III and IV clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutics, vaccines and other preventive modalities.  NIAID/DAIDS currently funds more than 300 clinical trials in over 50 countries at more than 1,000 domestic and international clinical research sites. Since its inception in 1987, NIAID/DAIDS has designed, developed and sponsored extramural Clinical Trials Networks, supported investigator-initiated clinical trials, and partnered with other Government and private organizations to assist in carrying out the Divisions scientific objectives.

As the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug Application (IND) sponsor for a large number of NIAID/DAIDS-supported clinical trials, there is an established requirement for NIAID/DAIDS to provide regulatory support for these clinical trials to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, including Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 50, 54, 56 and 312, and Title 45 CFR Part 46.  Clinical trials must also be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines:  E2A Clinical Safety Data Management and E6 Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and country specific regulatory requirements.  In order to provide regulatory support services for NIAID/DAIDS clinical trials, a seven-year contract was awarded on October 3, 1995 to Social and Scientific Systems, Inc. to operate the Clinical and Regulatory Operations Center (CROC); the centers name was eventually shortened to the Regulatory Operations Center (ROC).  Subsequently, a recompetition of that contract resulted in the award of a 7-year contract to Technical Resources International, Inc. (TRI) on July 1, 2003 (Contract No. N01-AI-30032) under which NIAID/DAIDS regulatory support services are currently being provided.  Over the past six years, TRI has operated the Regulatory Compliance Center (RCC) to provide regulatory support services to over 1,000 clinical research sites in over 50 countries, with approximately half of the sites located in the United States and the remaining sites located in developing countries with a high incidence of HIV/AIDS.  The purpose of this contract is to continue and expand clinical regulatory and technical support services for NIAID/DAIDS-supported clinical trials.

Applications accepted - January 15 until 3:00 PM on March 16, 2009
Important information:This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will be administered by Everglades National Park (EVER), National Park Service (NPS)
Applicants are strongly encouraged to read the entire BAA before submitting applications or questions to avoid processing delays in the event that their proposal is selected for funding. 
Official information and updates related to this BAA will only be made available through www.Grants.gov and www.fbo.gov.  Please notify the Contracting Officer if you wish to create a link to this announcement from another website.  The Contracting Officer's contact information is provided in Section X of this BAA.
I)   SUMMARY
The Critical Ecosystem Studies Initiative (CESI) is a science program managed by Everglades National Park.  CESI was established in 1997 to fund science activities and projects that help Department of Interior managers, including National Park Services, make decisions about how to move forward with Everglades restoration. Since 1997, more than 250 separate projects have been selected and funded by CESI.  
Information about the CESI program can be found on http://www.nps.gov/ever/naturescience/cesi.htm.  Important guidelines for applicants related to permitting and compliance can be found on the South Florida Natural Resources Center website, http://www.nps.gov/ever/naturescience/sfnrc.htm.
This BAA is administered following the limitations and requirements of the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR), Part 35 -Research and Development Contracting.  For detailed information, please see http://www.arnet.gov/far/.
Successful proposals will:"	Be complementary to ongoing work"	address overall priority science DOI need"	define deliverables that include"	progress reports"	a technical final report, and "	summary fact sheet prepared for presentation of the project on the SFNRC/CESI website.
II. PRIORITY SCIENCE NEEDS 
Proposals are requested that are oriented toward addressing the science needs listed in this section.  Please note that some of these science needs are fairly specific, and others are more general.  By use of a BAA, CESI anticipates the submission of meaningful proposals with varying technical/scientific approaches.    
For background on DOI science needs listed in this BAA, the following reference information is provided:"	The DOI Science Plan in Support of Ecosystem Restoration, Preservation, and Protection in South Florida, May 2005 (DOI Science Plan).   is available online and can be downloaded athttp://www.sofia.usgs.gov/publications/reports/doi-science-plan/.  It is recommended that the "What is needed" sections in each chapter are reviewed before submitting to this BAA.  Please send all questions and comments to the contact person listed in this BAA, who will forward your inquiries to the CESI Project Management Specialist.
"	An overview of Everglades restoration issues, including the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), Acceler-8 (8 CERP projects on an accelerated schedule), CERP Interim Goals and RECOVER, may be viewed at   http://www.evergladesplan.org/ .  RECOVER and the Monitoring and Assessment Plan can be found at http://www.evergladesplan.org/pm/recover/recover.cfm.  Interagency science priorities can be reviewed at http://www.sfrestore.org.  Information about the hydrologic models developed by the South Florida Water Management District can be found at http://www.sfwmd.gov/org/pld/hsm/hsm.html/ .  

A. Hydrologic and Ecological Modeling:  Tool DevelopmentWork is needed on modeling of surface water and ground water dynamics to simulate the impact of projects on water patterns, water quality, and ecology in the following areas:  Biscayne National Park and associated basins and upstream systems; the eastern border of the Water Conservation Areas and Everglades National Park; Northeast and Central Florida Bay; Picayune Strand and Ten-Thousand Islands area of SW coastal areas; and A.R.M. Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge.  Refinement of existing models will, in general, be given priority over new model development.  Models and project effects simulated may be of the scale of planned pre-CERP and CERP hydrologic restoration projects, or may be of a more local scale so as to capture effects of, for example, localized operational deviations, quarries, or species with localized ranges. 
We expect fund 2-3 projects in this area for 3 years.

B. Water Management Operations and Climatic Variability:  ApplicationsResearch is needed that assists in determining the effects of water management operations (e.g. structure discharge, canal stages, and operating plans such as Regulation Schedule[s], Rainfall Plans, Marsh Operations, and Minimum Deliveries)  and climate variability (inter-annual variability in rainfall, hurricane frequency, drought frequency), on biological resources including community composition and function in the following areas: "	Ridge and slough"	Tree islands"	Florida Bay and Biscayne Bay"	Picayune Strand restoration project watershedThis research may utilize existing or new field information, and/or modeling tools.  CERP and pre-CERP projects that are of most interest in the context of this science need are the Modified Water Deliveries project and the C111 South Dade project, the WCA3A Decompartmentalization project, the C111 Spreader Canal project, and the ENP seepage management project.
We expect to fund 2-4 projects in this area for 3 years.

C. Climate Change and Sea Level RiseWe require studies that address the impacts of climate change and sea level rise on DOI trust resources in the South Florida ecosystem, in the context of Everglades restoration.  Some questions that are pertinent to management decision-making, and that should be considered in the development of proposals are: "	What are the predicted effects of sea-level rise on coastal ecosystems in South Florida (including the natural and built system), and how do these effects relate to restoration activities?  We are looking for refinement and applications of tools (including existing models, and remote imagery) that provide quantitative landscape-scale assessments of surface water distribution, vegetation type, critical habitat status, and estuarine conditions. "	Can increased freshwater flow ameliorate the effects of sea level rise in South Florida built and natural systems, and to what extent?  "	What is the status of coastal ecosystems/coastal communities/coastal species within the DOI trust resources of South Florida?  The focus should be on ecosystems that are affected both by sea level rise/climate change and by Everglades restoration activities. "	What are the best (i.e. the most parsimonious suite of) physical or ecological indicators to monitor that track the effects of climate change and sea level rise on DOI trust resources in South Florida?  Indicators that are tracked by other State and Federal agencies should be distinguished from those that should be tracked by DOI.
We expect to fund 1-5 projects in this area for 3 years.

D. Invasive Exotic Organisms (both Plant and Animal)  We require studies that provide information on the impact, prevention, management and control of invasive exotic organisms within federally managed areas.  Management questions that should be addressed in proposals are the following:"	What are the best systems for early detection of and rapid response to incipient populations of non-native invasive animals and plants in the South Florida Ecosystem, particularly those that pose a threat to DOI resources?"	How can managers predict which non-native invasive animals (particularly fish and reptiles) currently in the South Florida system pose the greatest risk of invasion and/or impact to communities of native species? (predictive risk-assessment studies)"	What are the best alternative structural designs to use in pre-CERP or CERP projects that would prevent or limit the spread of non-native species?"	What are the impacts to and responses of native animals to introduction and persistence of exotic organisms in terrestrial and aquatic environments in federally managed areas?
We expect to fund 2-5 projects in this area for 3 years.

E. Avian Ecology and Multi-species ManagementSnail Kites:  Work is needed to integrate research on habitat quality, apple snail reproduction and availability, and population parameters of the snail kite in South Florida.  The outcome of this work should be an "integrated suite of recommendations that identifies the range of acceptable water management strategies and expected outcomes [for the Snail Kite], with respect to their short term and long term effects on the status of the vegetation communities, Apple Snails and Snail Kites, and their interactions." (SEI report, 2007, www.sei.org .)  
We expect to fund 1-2 projects in this area for 3 years.

F. A Synthesis of Freshwater Everglades Research  A synthesis of field data, historical information and modeling results of the last 1-2 decades of intensive Everglades freshwater research is needed.  This synthesis should review the literature for emerging scientific results that are pertinent to the refinement of long-term restoration goals and targets in South Florida, and to the design of restoration projects to move toward those goals.  Identification of gaps in scientific knowledge should also result from this work.  The synthesis should focus on the Everglades freshwater ecosystem from Lake Okeechobee southward, and include such topics as hydrology and water flow patterns, water quality, sediment transport, vegetative habitats (tree islands, ridge and slough, marsh, wet prairie), and ecological communities.  
A book or a dedicated journal issue is envisioned as the result of this work.  The resulting work should provide resource managers with information for decision-making.  For example, a synthesis of water quality research might include a review of how nutrients in the water column as compared to the effects of local or regional dry downs affect the trajectory and timeframe of ecosystem restoration upon re-hydration.  
We expect to fund 1 project in this area for 3 years.

III)     BAA OBJECTIVES
A)	The long-term objective of the DOI science initiative is to provide support to initiate and accelerate research for critical science in support of the Greater Everglades ecosystem restoration initiative.

The chronology of the evaluation process will be as follows:1)	The NPS Contracting Office will review the proposals to ensure compliance with element, format, and assembly requirements.
2)	Technical review:  (a)	First, proposals will be reviewed by an independent science committee for scientific merit and ability to address the stated need.  (i)	General evaluation criteria in order of importance are:1.	(30%) the project's ability to effectively define and achieve objectives, with methodologies, study designs, and critical analyses that can successfully meet peer reviews and critical evaluations by subject matter experts, and effective definition of deliverables that address a restoration science objective in a significant manner (acquisition of specific data, quantitative functional measurements, tests of hypotheses, development of a useful predictive model, etc.)
2.	(20%) urgency or timelines: proximity to restoration-related decision deadlines, which may be based on restoration implementation activities, such as water control project designs or project environmental impact assessments.
3.	(20%) the offeror's capability, related experience, facilities, techniques, past performance, or unique combinations of these, which are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principle investigator.
4.	(15%) relevance to past and current studies in the topic area: objectives and results of a project shall avoid redundancy to add significantly to what is already known about a technical issue. 
5.	(15%) technical review of effectiveness, in terms of cost (including cost-share opportunities), timeliness, and quality of information.
(b)	Second, a DOI science committee will review the proposals and determine if they adequately address a DOI science need.  The proposals will also be reviewed at this time for their applicability to on-going Greater Everglades restoration activities.  
(c)	Third, the management and science committee rankings will be combined and final recommendations for funding will be forwarded to the CESI Manager, Everglades National Park Superintendent, for approval and implementation through their respective administrative procedures.  
3)	Cost review:(a)	The CESI Project Manager and Contracting Office will perform a cost review of the proposed budgets to consider the Best Value Continuum (viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/) and the Tradeoff Process, which is appropriate when it may be in the best interest of the government to consider an award to other than the lowest priced applicant or other than the highest technically rated applicant.  
(b)	Applicants are encouraged to have competitive indirect cost rates.  Cooperative Ecosystems Studies Unit (CESU). 
4)	Applicants whose proposals are selected for CESI funding will be notified in writing and assigned a NPS technical representative.  Guidance on the information required for the development of a scope of work and funding distribution will be made available at the time the award announcements are made.  IX. AWARD PERIOD AND TYPES
A)	Recipients and sub-recipients will be subject to all applicable federal laws and agency policies, regulations, and procedures.  
B)	Each award will have an expiration date of one (1) year from the award date. Projects with approved scheduled over one year will be reviewed annually to extend the term via award modifications.  Award modifications are generally reviewed annually in a process separate from this BAA.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible small business firms capable of performing Design/Bid/Build (Pipeline removal) services for Casco Bay-to-Brunswick Naval Air Station Pipeline, Harpswell and Brunswick, Maine  Description of proposed project: The Navy proposes to remove a 7.25 mile portion of pipeline that extends through privately held properties from the northern boundary of Mitchell Field in Harpswell, Maine (formerly the Defense Fuel Support Point (DFSP)-Casco Bay fuel terminal) to the southern boundary of the Brunswick Naval Air Station.  This portion of the pipeline consists of a 30 foot wide easement and right-of-way through South Harpswell and Brunswick, Maine.  The pipeline consists of two separate pipes that were used to transfer jet fuel, primarily JP-5, from 1952 until 1991 when the pipeline was taken out of service.  The pipeline is constructed of two separate carbon steel pipes with welded joints, tar exterior coating, and a fire resistant asbestos wrapping.  The depth of the pipeline ranges from approximately 1.7 to 7.3 feet below ground surface with an average depth of 3.5 feet below ground surface.  The total amount of land disturbance that would be required to re! move the pipeline is approximately 26.36 acres.  The proposed pipeline removal includes clearing selected portions the land easement containing the pipeline; excavation of the pipeline; and processing removal of the asbestos containing wrapping and steel pipe.  
Portions of the 7.25 mile long easement and right-of-way may need to be cleared.  The easement consists of 115 parcels of private property in South Harpswell and Brunswick, Maine.  A utility survey is required to identify utility right-of-ways and where public and private utilities are present within the easement.  Wetlands are present along the easement.  Routine maintenance of the pipeline easement ceased when the pipeline became inactive in 1991; therefore, clearing selected portions of the 30 foot wide easement would be necessary to allow movement of excavation equipment and haulers to transport the removed sections of pipeline.  
The entire 7.25 mile pipeline is required to be removed and includes aboveground and underground fuel system piping and associated appurtenances located within the easement.  From the fuel terminal in Harpswell, the pipeline consists of a 6 inch diameter pipe and a 10 inch diameter pipe which both extend one mile to a concrete "scraper pit."  The scraper pit is a partially buried concrete vault, approximately 26 feet long 22.5 feet wide , and 7.5 feet deep, used for accessing and cleaning the pipelines.  At the scrapper pit, the 10 inch pipe is reduced to an 8 inch pipe.  From the scraper pit, the 8 inch pipe and the 6 inch pipe extend the remaining 6.25 miles to Brunswick Naval Air Station.  Associated appurtenances include concrete markers, pipeline signage, cathodic protection system test stations, the scraper pit structure, and various values, fittings, and flanges connected to the pipeline (including asbestos-containing gaskets) located within the scraper pit structure.!   The pipeline was drained, cleaned ("pigged"), and pressurized with nitrogen in 1991 when the pipeline became inactive.  Pressurization with nitrogen was maintained until August 1995, when the pressure was lost due to demolition of the valve system at the Brunswick Naval Air Station fuel farm.  Following removal of the pipeline, an assessment of soils directly below the original location of the pipeline is required.  Soil samples are required to be collected in duplicate at 25 foot intervals along the length of the pipeline and initially screed on-site using a photo ionization detector.  Site restoration includes rough grading along the easement with imported clean backfill, as well as driveway and roadway crossings repaired to applicable State or Town requirements.  Stabilization of disturbed soils includes finish grading and native grass seed application.
The steel pipe is wrapped with a tar exterior coating and a fire resistant asbestos wrapping.  The asbestos wrapping may be considered friable under deteriorated conditions; however, in general this type of wrapping in non-deteriorated condition may be considered a non-friable asbestos-containing material (ACM).  
Transportation and disposal of ACM waste are regulated by Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).  Friable asbestos can be transported by Maine DEP licensed "non-hazardous waste transporter" to a landfill approved to accept friable asbestos.  Intact non-friable asbestos waste, which is removed whole, can be disposed of at landfills in accordance with the landfill's license requirements.
The budget magnitude is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. 
All Service Disabled Veteran (SDV) small businesses, certified HUBZone small businesses, certified 8(a) small businesses, and other certified small businesses are encouraged to respond.  Large Business submittals will not be considered.  Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Synopsis, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Government's best interest.  This office anticipates award of a contract for these services prior to 30 August 2009.  The appropriate NAICS code for this procurement is 237120.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  This synopsis is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential small business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and ultimate issuance of an award.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from the potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  ! It is requested that interested small businesses submit to the contracting officer a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum) demonstrating ability to perform the requested services.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Superfund/RCRA Regional Procurement Operations Division (SRRPOD), is conducting a sources sought FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY to determine whether small socioeconomic business capabilities exist to support this requirement.
PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. This notice is applicable to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services (covering 15% of the need), code 541513 - Computer Facilities Management Services or code 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services (covering 85% of the need) and the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 8999; and size standard $7 Million. EPA is in search of small socioeconomic businesses (such as 8(a), HUB Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs)) to provide Enforcement Support Services for Enforcement and Information (E & I) activities in the following major areas: Community Relations, Enforcement, Administrative Records, Freedom of Information Act Response, Superfund Records and Documents, and Special Projects; for the Superfund Programs of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Regions 5 (Chicago, IL) and 6 (Dallas, TX).  
The services to be provided shall be in accordance with all environmental statutes as appropriate.  A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) will be posted on the EPA HQ website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/solam.htm.
Interested parties must possess the experience and capabilities to provide Enforcement Support Services for the Enforcement and Information (E & I) activities listed above and to provide (1) Progress Reports for Monitoring Costs and Progress of Work; (2) Task Order Work Plans; (3) Project Reports; and (4) Cost Recovery Documentation.  The Contractor shall perform in accordance with all applicable guidance, regulation, and law.  The contractor must be familiar with all U.S. environmental statutes (e.g., Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA),  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Clean Air Act (CAA), Clean Water Act (CWA) and Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), or successor statutes), but must possess particular, demonstrable knowledge of the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amended by the  Superfund Amendments Reauthorization Act (SARA), and the Small Business Relief and Brownfield Revitalization Act ("Brownfield's Amendments"), as well as the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements.  	Successful completion of enforcement activities at Superfund sites requires close coordination of these activities in concert with other site events.  The pace of enforcement activities is often dictated by removal actions, mandatory notice to Potential Responsible Parties (PRPs), public comment periods, and statutes of limitation (SOL).  Each of the enforcement support activities listed in this PWS is interrelated with and dependent upon the others.  Site complexities such as divisible harm, multiple operable units, and both cooperative and recalcitrant PRPs at the same site make it difficult to delineate the end of one enforcement activity and the beginning of another.  Enforcement should be considered an ongoing process rather than a discrete event.  Each activity has a direct bearing on the others, and successful performance of each activity is essential to the successful completion of all activities.  Therefore, in order to competently provide support in the following major areas of Community Relations, Enforcement, Administrative Records, Freedom of Information Act Response, Superfund Records and Documents, and Special Projects, the contractor must be capable - in terms of knowledge, experience and personnel - to provide support for them all.	The Agency's responsibility to the public requires the creation and maintenance of records which document every type of Superfund activity and the cost of those activities. These records, regardless of media, must be preserved to ensure their integrity and their availability during the site life cycle for the site and beyond.  This contract entails support of the Agency to accomplish these dual missions of preservation and production.  All aspects of the Superfund Program require records management characterized by efficiency, efficaciousness, and excellence.
Interested parties shall provide all of the following information:  (1) business name, address, telephone number and business site and socioeconomic category for NAICS code 541620, 541513 and 541611; (2) a concise capability statement showing that your firm is qualified to perform the above mentioned tasks, limiting the response to no more than five (5) double sided pages. Capability statements should respond to all items requested herein to allow for an accurate business assessment. Standard brochures and paraphrasing of the PWS will not be considered as a sufficient response to this notice; (3) a list of current and past contracts with similar requirements not to exceed 1 page. 
Feedback and/or evaluation information will not be provided to any firm regarding their individual capability statements. Telephone calls and/or requests for a solicitation will be not be accepted or acknowledged. All responses should be sent via the e-mail link provided in the section entitled point of contact(s) listed below.
Firms shall ensure responses are documented to the extent the Government can determine the firms qualifications to perform this requirement. If it is determined that there are not enough firms of a specific category such as 8(a), HUB Zone or SDVOSBs to ensure adequate competition, this procurement will be set-aside for small business. This sources sought does not constitute a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>The Coast Guard is seeking potential suppliers and sources for Test & Repair of the VAMP. The VAMP provides computational, control, data storage, and workstation interface capabilities for the U.S. Coast Guard C-130J Long Range Surveillance (LRS) Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA). The VAMP will employ internal Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) general purpose video processing cards and removable hard drives to allow for common logistics support and maintenance.  The VAMP processes operator inputs from the keyboards, trackballs, Programmable Entry Panels (PEP) and from a flight deck workstation.  The VAMP outputs high resolution Red Green Blue (RGB) video to two workstation displays and one flight deck display.  The VAMP chassis is a rugged enclosure designed for airborne applications.  The current design utilizes 16 slots, leaving growth for five additional standard single slot VME modules.  The internal processing and electronics consist of the following:? 2 Intel? processors for Deepwater software applications; 
? 2 Scalable Processing Architecture (SPARC?) processors for Defense Information Infrastructure Core Operating Environment (DIICOE) and sensor application software;
? 3 Intel? processors for graphics processing, the one for the CTD requires a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Mezzanine Card (PMC) due to the orientation difference of the display; 
? 3 video window cards to blend radar video and display live and/or recorded radar and EO/IR video; 
? 2 video cross-point switch cards for video routing internal to the VAMP; 
? 1 Ethernet switch for network routing 
? 1 logic board that provides antenna switching control logic for the communications subsystem 
? 1 logic board that holds the converter modules for the keyboard interfaces. The VAMP also utilizes four (4) 73 GB removable disk drive modules to provide the necessary mission software and data storage capacity for the system. There are additional modules installed in the VAMP to support the various data interfaces. 

The response must include a brief statement to attest to the vendor?s qualification. After the review of the responses to this announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the FEDBIZOPS. Responses to this sources sought notice are not an adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. Telephone responses will not be accepted.  All firms responding to this notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.

Services require Global travel to survey COCOM intelligence, surveillance reconnaissance (ISR) staffs as well as travel to local Washington DC area locations.

The Government anticipates releasing a single solicitation from which multiple contracts may be awarded.  Requirements in the solicitation will be divided on a functional basis.  The Government may award as few as one (1) or as many as five (5) contracts and anticipates that portions of this requirement will be subject to Full and Open Competition, and small business and 8(a) competitions only.

<p>Description</p>
<p>Special Notice DARPA-SN-09-13: Wound Stasis System Workshop; <br />WORKSHOP DATE: Feb 18, 2009; <br />REGISTRATION DEADLINE: Feb 6, 2009; <br />TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Jon Mogford, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (571) 218-4928, Fax: (703) 741-7845; Email: BAA08-22@darpa.mil; URL: http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/index.asp?MeetingID=634</p>
<p><br />The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a workshop to discuss innovative research that will create a targeted wound stasis material and delivery system for the treatment of all hemorrhaging wounds, compressible and non-compressible, regardless of geometry or location. The primary function of Wound Stasis System (WSS) is hemostasis through exploitation of damaged tissue as the nucleation site for a materials-based, cross-linking response that provides focal pressure on damaged blood vessels. Metabolic control at the wound site is a secondary goal including management of pain, infection and inflammation. Specific challenges of the WSS program will include, but are not limited to, the development of: 1) delivery formats effective on intracavity and irregular surface wounds, 2) novel material(s) that bind specifically and selectively to damaged tissue, and 3) material(s) that can be easily removed and does not impede normal healing. The WSS material will be compatible with co-delivery of FDA-approved agents. The WSS deliverable will be a hand-held delivery device carried by the individual soldier that maintains therapeutic capability and stability of the wound stasis material under military operating conditions, carries enough material to effectively treat 0.2 m2 of tissue, and is operable with one hand. The WSS product represents an easily self-applied wound therapy that addresses military needs for control of blood loss and improved wound outcome. Complete program metrics will be specified in a forthcoming Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).</p>
<p>The goals of the workshop are to detail the WSS program milestones and to promote discussion of the scientific challenges. Workshop participants are encouraged to prepare posters describing previous or potential research consistent with the program goals in order to facilitate discussions and formation of well-rounded teams to meet the program metrics. It is anticipated that successful teams will be led by a strong Systems Integrator and possess expertise in biomaterials engineering, computational protein design, cellular/extracellular biology, emergency and veterinary medicine and knowledge of the FDA approval path for like devices and products. For poster submissions, a detailed description of the poster must be submitted by Feb 6, 2009 4:00PM ET. A maximum of twenty (20) 4ft x 4ft posters can be accommodated and will be accepted in order of submission.</p>
<p>The WSS Workshop will be held at 3601 Wilson Blvd, Suite 600, Arlington, VA, 22201. There is no registration fee. Details on the workshop, including registration and poster information, can be found at the following URL: http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/index.asp?MeetingID=634. The password for login is: WSSArlington</p>
<p>Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 50 people, maximum 2 from each institution). The registration cutoff date is February 6, 2009, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first. If there is additional space available after the registration deadline, institutions will be permitted to add participants on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>
<p>Further administrative questions about the workshop should be directed to the attention of Ms. Carol Higgins (Carol.Higgins.ctr@darpa.mil). For those interested but unable to attend, requests for DARPA materials presented at the workshop also should be directed to Ms. Carol Higgins. Further technical questions about the workshop should be directed to the attention of Dr. Jon Mogford (Jon.Mogford@darpa.mil). Please refer to the Wound Stasis System Workshop in any correspondence.

4. Background: The NGJ system is intended to replace the capability currently enabled by the ALQ-99 jamming pods, providing a significant enhancement to the EA-18Gs EA capabilities at a reduced operations and sustainment cost.  First identified in the 2002 AEA System of Systems (SoS) AoA, there is a compelling need, founded in both capability and sustainability to move beyond the ALQ-99. This need was recently re-validated in the Joint AEA (JAEA) Study, conducted by the Office of Secretary of Defense Program, Analysis and Evaluation [OSD (PA&E)].  A subsequent Program Decision Memorandum in December 2007 provided funding to initiate the Technology Development phase of an NGJ program.  On October 15th 2008, the AEA/EA-6B Program Manager, PEO-T/PMA-234, posted a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for NGJ Trade Studies, awards for which are anticipated early in 2009.  These 6-month studies will analyze NGJ mission needs, explore trades related to system effectiveness and architectures, develop a system technical baseline, and define corresponding program planning documentation.  In November 2007, the Office of Naval Research initiated the Next Generation AEA (NGAEA) Future Naval Capabilities Enabling Capability project.  This 5-year project will pursue high-risk, high-payoff component technology development capable of transition to future NGJ sub-systems.  Phase 0 of the NGAEA project explored NGJ system concepts and identified critical technology needs.  The remaining four years of the NGAEA project will develop component technologies capable of integrating into NGJ sub-system designs and providing improved performance and/or reduced cost, size, weight and prime power consumption.


5. AoA Guidance: Information below provides a summary of key information contained within the approved AoA Guidance. More complete AoA Guidance will be provided in the NGJ AoA Directives Extracts Document (See GFI). In accordance with Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff instructions; the USN completed a NGJ Functional Solutions Analysis (FSA) to illustrate how the NGJ system can provide a solution to current and projected EA-18G/ALQ-99 program of record gaps in war fighting capability.  The FSA concluded that no non-materiel solutions to the acknowledged EA-18G/ALQ-99 gaps exist.  The materiel solutions explored in the FSA show the NGJ system provides increased war fighting capabilities over the ALQ-99 on the EA-18G.  The FSA cost estimates for NGJ found the potential program to be an Acquisition Category (ACAT) ID level program.  

An AoA is required to determine courses of action to correct current and projected gaps in ALQ-99 capability and supportability.  The scope of the NGJ AoA will include analysis of the ALQ-99 TJS baseline and potential NGJ candidates to be initially integrated onto the EA-18G and potentially the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. When employed against a target set that includes conventional and irregular warfare radar and communications systems, NGJ-equipped aircraft are expected to have the same, or better, level of airborne electronic attack capability as an EA-6B ICAP3 aircraft, operating the ALQ-99 and ALQ-218 systems.  NGJ should provide improved Reliability, Maintainability and Availability (RMA) over that of the ALQ-99. All NGJ alternatives will be assessed as candidates for use by the EA-18G and F-35.  There are three alternative categories for the NGJ AoA.  They are as follows:

Alternative Category 1: Incremental modernization of the current ALQ-99 TJS sub-system, starting with the oldest and/or most critical bands (such as Bands 4 and 5/6).

Alternative Category 2: Fielding of a new jamming system that draws on technology at technology readiness level (TRL) 5 or 6.  Concepts within this alternative should incorporate commercial off-the-shelf technology as feasible.  

Alternative Category 3: Exploration of the costs and benefits of a new jamming system based on a lower initial TRL.  Concepts within this alternative should initially address the core component requirement currently filled by the ALQ-99.  However, it should use technologies that could be adapted for future jamming systems that address all AEA system of systems mission areas


6. RFI Response Input to AoA: The Navy requests from interested sources information for system concepts that fit within the AoA Alternatives Categories described in Section 5. One or more concepts may be submitted for each alternative or sources can limit information to only one concept for one alternative. For each concept, technical and program-related information is desired that addresses each of the following areas:

a.	Identification of the AoA Alternative Category which the concept addresses
b.	The platform or platforms (EA-18G, F-35A/B/C, both platforms) to which the concept applies 
c.	Concepts of operations, expressed through DoD Architectural Framework Operational Views, depicting use of NGJ-equipped platforms, within the AEA System of Systems, for Suppression of Enemy Air Defense and Irregular Warfare missions
d.	A description for the concept that illustrates its major sub-systems, estimated size, weight and prime power demands, and its installation on the platform(s). Information explaining how the concept addresses needs for modular and open architecture is desired.    
e.	The technical aspects of the platform integration for the system concept, including its interfaces with other systems (weapons systems, controls/displays, etc) on the platform and any projected platform modifications.  Interfaces with and required modifications to existing AEA receivers, ES/ESM receivers & Radar systems should be described, as should impacts to platform performance (e.g. range, ceiling, on-station time, signature).  If the concept involves the use and integration of new hardware/software with a portion of the ALQ-99 (e.g. Low Band Pod containing Low Band Transmitters and Universal Exciter Upgrade), a description of such and identification of associated issues is desired.  
f.	An assessment of the performance of the concept compared to the NGJ System Capabilities Document and the QFD Final Report (see GFI). This assessment should include information concerning RMA improvements over the current ALQ-99. Specific information is desired concerning the concepts functioning within the AEA SoS and its attributes or functions relating to EW Battle Management.  
g.	An assessment of interoperability considerations for the concept  (including own-ship, friendly forces, civilian systems, quality of service, and battle management) and the architecture implications. 
h.	Identification and discussion of the component and sub-system technologies required to develop the concept, their current TRL, the time lines required to achieve TRL 7 (based on program initiation in 2010), any NGJ-specific technology maturation required, and the ability and degree of difficulty to integrate component technologies into sub-systems and sub-systems into a system.
i.	A description of any assumed product support strategy, including maintenance concepts and associated integrated logistics support elements, such as support equipment, spares/provisioning, training/trainers, manpower & facilities, and technical data.  
j.	A rough-order-of magnitude cost estimate of the major program phases to develop and field the concept program, possibly including Technology Development, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, Production and Deployment up to Initial Operational Capability (IOC), and full rate production required to meet Full Operational Capability (FOC). IOC is defined as the successful testing and fielding of a sufficient number of NGJ systems and all required logistics support elements in order to meeting initial training requirements and deploy a single 5-aircraft EA-18G squadron. FOC is defined as the fielding of a sufficient number of NGJ systems and all required logistics support elements, including spares, to outfit all ten Navy EA-18G squadrons, plus the Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS). If possible, provide a high level work breakdown structure against which the major cost elements of the program would be allocated.  In addition, cost estimates for integrated logistics support elements and other life cycle cost elements are desired.   
k.	An assessment of the ability to develop and field the concept system in a manner that achieves IOC in late 2018 and identification of alternative schedules required or recommended.  In addition to this assessment, provide an estimated schedule of major events and milestones for the concept.  
l.	An assessment of technical, schedule and cost risks envisioned for the concept and recommendations for mitigation of risks assessed as moderate or high.   
m.	Identification of any opportunities to capitalize on other military and commercial investments/programs in order to improve capability or reduce costs, schedule and risks.  If possible, please cite names of any programs cited and describe a vision for capitalizing on the stated opportunity.  Describe any opportunities for which an NGJ concept could fulfill a capability gap outside of the AEA war fighting area.

<DESC>Q1 Coverage for GBD's is either one or the other but with the current spec it's not possible for both to happen.  The spec calls for the GBD's to be mounted by the PIR's, but at the same time it's calling for them to detect the breaking of glass form all windows in the building.  Because of range and obstruction issues mounting the GBD's "only" by the PIR's you will have range issues.A1 Bid as indicated in the specifications.Q2 In the spec you are calling for a surface mounted DSR contact, but in a later paragraph you spec that all DSR contacts most be able to be either surface, recessed or flush mounted.  This spec will require three different styles of contact.A2 Bid as indicated in the specifications.Q3 Spec calls for both "Standard DSP fixed" "or" "pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras for all indoor applications with the only exception being when backlighting issues are observed.  We need to have clarified which ones you want at which locations.A3 All cameras shall be fixedQ4 Current spec does not call for contractors to provide any access control strike / magnetic lock work.  Our assumption is all strike / magnetic lock work to be provided by us.A4 All physical access control to be provided and installed by the contractorQ5 What type of electric locks are required at each door?A5 Bid as indicated in the specifications.Q6 When there is a "Power Failure",. should these doors remain secure or unlock?A6 Bid as indicated in the specifications.Q7 Are door contacts required on each door?A7 Bid as indicated in the specifications.Q8Are any remote signals sent from the system? If so, what signals, to whom are they sent, and by what transmission method?A8 Bid as indicated in the specifications.Q9 Please explain in 2.3.1 your definition of overlapping.A9 Bid as indicated in the specifications. Q10 In section 2.2 C   Please explain "Provide redundant communication links from control units to CPU"A10 Bid as indicated in the specifications.Q11 In section 2.2D Please clarify - "archived alarm events with recorded video at two seperate locations"A11 Bid as indicated in the specifications.Q12 In section 2.2E   The sentence ends after the word two.  ( please elaborate)A12 Strike the words "at two." at the end of the paragraphQ13 In section 2.3.8 (2) is this calling for wireless devices?A13 Bid as indicated in the specifications.Q14 In section 2.3.11.1 (G) We so not believe this will be possible on the four rear porch camera's - Will this exception be allowed? A14 Bid as indicated in the specifications.Q15 Who is responsible for the cooling of the closet?A15 Bid as indicated in the specifications.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 13.5, the U.S. Army, REDCOM, Natick Contracting Division, Kansas Street, Natick, MA on behalf of the United States Army  Soldier System Center, Natick, intends to negotiate a purchase order to Malvern Instruments, Inc 117 Flanders Road, Westborough, MA.  0158102035.   This is for the purchase of ZEN3602 Light Scattering Instrument Package.  Malvern Instruments is the only Company that can meet the following requirements.<BR><BR>1.	The backscatter optics. At 173 backscatter, the volume observed is about 8 times the volume observed with 90degree scattering optics. This gives 8 times the detected count rate. This improvement relates directly to improved sensitivity.<BR><BR>2.	The fiber detection system. The fiber detection optics ensure that the Signal/Background ratio or more correctly, the Intercept, is not degraded at these high detection volumes as it would with 'classical' optics. Increasing the count rate while simultaneously reducing the intercept is of little value.<BR><BR>3.	The high efficiency detector. A high efficiency avalanche photodiode detector (APD), specially selected for dynamic light scattering applications is used, giving typically ten to fifteen times the efficiency of a photomultiplier, and hence ten to fifteen times the sensitivity. There are currently no other systems that use a backscatter configuration that have a high efficiency APD.<BR><BR>4.	The patented optics. The design of the optics means that losses in the light collected are minimized.<BR><BR>5.	The suppression of 'noise'. Sensitivity is not all about count rate, for example heterodyne backscatter systems have a very high count rate but low sensitivity. This is because most of the count rate in a heterodyne system is a reference signal that does not contribute to the data. What is as important as the count rate is the suppression of noise or flare, so that all the photons detected contribute to the data. There are a number of ways this is done in the ZETASIZER NANO SERIES:<BR>"	Suppression of reflections in the optics set up, including the tilting of the sample cell.<BR>"	Optimizing the Signal/Noise automatically, by moving the cell to the optimum position to maximize the Intercept and the count rate.<BR>"	Using symmetrical normalization in the correlator. This compensates for the statistical fluctuations between channels as the count rate varies, and gives a more reliable value for each channel. This achieves the same data quality in a shorter time, or conversely better data over an equivalent time.<BR>"	Stabilization of the optics and electronics, so that count rates only 50% in excess of the count rate obtained from the dispersant are high enough to enable a measurement to be made.<BR>"	Use of a He-Ne laser gives an exceptionally low noise stable source, with an excellent polarization ratio and mode stability. <BR><BR>6.	The high concentration capability. If we define 'Sensitivity' at high sizes, i.e. particles over a micron, as meaning the ability to measure a precise size, then the higher measurement volume, and being able to measure at higher concentrations, reduces number fluctuations, and improves the result accuracy and precision dramatically.  Questions concerning this acquisition may be addressed to the above address, Attention: Mr. Greg Wilson (AMSRD-ACC-NS) or by greg.n.wilson@us.army.mil.  This synopsis expires Janurary 22, 2008 at 8:00 am local time. <BR>

<DESC>NAICS Code:  541620 Environmental Consulting Services, this is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) and is designated as full and open competition.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Exposure Research Laboratory in Research Triangle Park, NC (RTP), under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13, on a fixed price basis, intends to purchase Scientific and Technical Consulting in support of a study that will collect needed data on selected green infrastructure technologies.
The EPA has established a partnership with many national groups in promoting the use of green infrastructure as a preferred approach to stormwater management.  While much data have been generated on green infrastructure performance so far, much more data and case studies are needed on, for example, optimal media composition, parameter estimation for predictive models, and cost/benefit analysis, for widespread implementation of green infrastructure.   This effort/study shall comply with the specifications listed below. TECHNICAL APPROACH: 
Phase 1: Green Roofs vs. Blue Roofs
1.	The contractor shall collect basic data on rainwater and stormwater runoff characteristics in the study watershed.  
2.	The contractor shall design, construct and provide a new or retrofitted full-scale green roof, blue roof, and conventional control roof for the study.  Each of the three roofs shall be at least 100 ft square.
3.	The contractor shall provide the necessary flow quality and quantity monitoring instrumentation.  Roof runoff shall be controlled by a static valve such as the Reg-U-Flo   ? (Hydro Brake) (or approved equal) for the study to compare a green vs. blue vs. conventional (control) roof.
4.	The contractor shall conduct a roof analyses which shall include a minimum of the following hydrological parameters:?	  rainfall?	  runoff?	  substrate moisture?	  temperature (air, roof surfaces, base of growth media, indoors below roof ceiling)?	  humidity?	  wind speed/direction?	  net solar radiation
5.	The contractor shall conduct a roof analyses which shall include a minimum of the following quality parameters:?	 solids (suspended, volatile suspended, dissolved)?	 turbidity?	 BOD5/BODu/COD?	 nutrients (N&P)?	 pH?	 metals
6.	The contractor shall analyze experimental results of analyses indicated in items 4 and 5, above and integrate those results with available literature data for similar analyses.
Phase 2:  Bioretention Cell
1.	provide a pilot-scale bioretention facility for the study having a plan area of at least 9 square.
2.	provide the necessary flow quality and quantity monitoring instrumentation.
3.	collect data on media mix and effects of vegetation types on the performance of bioretention cells in managing stormwater runoff quantity and quality.  The analyses shall include a minimum of:?	rainfall?	runoff?	media moisture?	solids (suspended, volatile suspended, dissolved)?	BOD5/BODu/COD?	nutrients (N&P)?	pH?	metals
4.	analyze experimental results and integrate results with literature and data
Phase 3:  
	The contractor shall organize and conduct an international conference on urban watershed management emphasizing green infrastructure.
DELIVERABLES
The contractor shall provide the following deliverables for both Phase 1 and Phase 2.1.	Workplan.  The contractor shall prepare and submit a Workplan to the EPA Program Officer (PO) for approval within two months of contract award.  The Workplan shall contain a cost proposal and a schedule with a list of milestones and assumptions. The workplan shall include rooftop and bioretention facility descriptions with diagrams and monitoring locations; study duration, installation and research schedule (including deliverables) and frequency and number of monitoring events; a complete description of 
sampling, flow measuring, rain gauging, and all other instrumentation to be used; functions to be performed by the Principal Investigator (PI) and contract team staff; complete set of data to be collected, e.g., rainfall and runoff, weather (solar-radiation, wind speed, temperature, and humidity), water quantity and quality, analytical measurements; analytical results, e.g., green and blue roof performance and efficiency compared to control roof, bioretention facility performance and efficiency, implications, sustainability as a water management tool, hydrologic (including evaportranspiration) and water quality balance components, economics, and recommendations for implementation.  
2.	Quality Assurance.  The contractor shall comply with all requirements as delineated in Attachment 1 ?NRMRL QA Requirements and Definition? included with this extramural action.  EPA requires a QA narrative statement.  The QAPP shall contain the data collection strategy and target ending date in relation to QAPP approval.  The QAPP shall contain a project experimental design and sampling plan and monitoring needs to address the long-term maintenance and calibration requirements of real-time monitoring equipment.  The QAPP requires a schedule of monitoring equipment checks and calibrations.  The QAPP should determine the amount of storms necessary to develop statistically valid results of the study.  No work can start prior to EPA PO approval of the QAPP.
3.	Progress Reports.  The contractor shall provide brief technical reports to the PO via e-mail upon completion of deliverables listed in the Schedule.  The report shall be in a letter format.  An interim meeting with the PO can be proposed.
4.	Study Results.  The results of this study will be made available to the public.  A manuscript shall be prepared and submitted for peer-reviewed journal publication.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached. 

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>The following additional questions and supplemental answers are provided for all potential offerors for the FedRooms Program.

1.  RFP Page 4, Paragraph q requires that the Contractor shall obtain and make available to distribution channels the hotel propertys green criteria for environmentally friendly measures in the lodging sector . . . for travelers to consider in selecting a FedRooms property.  Please define distribution channels and clarify what is expected here on the part of the Contractor?  We ask because the hotels enter information on green initiatives in their property descriptions available through the GDS.

A. GSA would like the vendors proposal to address the current industry practice(s) on how hotels communicate their environmentally friendly initiatives to customers through the various distributions channels in which FedRooms rates are to be available.  

2.  RFP Page 8, Item D., Performance Measures, requires the contractor to include a quality assurance plan including the following Performance Measure:  1.  Timeliness of rate loading in all GDSs. The contractor has not control over timeliness as this function is performed by hoteliers. What does the government expect here?

A. GSA would like the vendors proposal to address current industry best practices on the timeliness of program rate loading in all major GDSs as a benchmark for how much time our program hotels shall have to load rates after they receive notification from the vendor that they are accepted into the lodging program.

3.  RFP Page 8, Item D., Performance Measures, requires the contractor to include a quality assurance plan including the following Performance Measure:  3.  Demonstrated savings of FedRooms utilization compared to industry benchmarks. To our knowledge, there are no industry benchmarks that would be applicable. Please define exactly to which industry benchmarks the government is referring? 

A. GSA would like the vendors proposal to suggest what industry benchmarks are most appropriate to compare program utilization based on the size and scope of the governmentwide lodging program.  If no benchmarks exist, please address in your proposal.

4.  RFP Page 8, Item D., Performance Measures, requires the contractor to include a quality assurance plan including the following Performance Measure: 4.  Percentage discount of FedRooms rates off the top 100 Business Travel News U.S. city per diems. While this in itself seems reasonable, RFP Page 10, Item c.iii requires a plan to rate benchmarking to demonstrate savings under FedRooms versus corporate rates, per diem rates, best available rates and other appropriate benchmarks.  Performing constant research to track and report benchmarking against corporate rates, best available rates and other rates that may be offered by hoteliers is excessively expensive and highly problematic. Would the government consider removing these benchmarks from the requirement to ensure that contractor costs do not exceed the benefits of providing this program?

A. Yes.  GSA would collaborate with the vendor to decide which benchmark is best to show the percentage discount in an effort to provide program effectiveness and validation.

5.  RFP Page 8, Item D., Performance Measures, requires the contractor to include a quality assurance plan including the following Performance Measure: 6.  Number of rooms available in each non-standard area s defined by GSAs domestic per diem rates . . . As FedRooms is not a blocked room program, please clarify what is expected here?

A. GSA would like to know how many rooms are represented by our program hotels in the top travel destinations defined by the domestic per diem rates in the Continental United States.  This may be approximately 400 non-standard destinations based on the FY09 per diem rates.

6.  RFP Page 10, Item c.v. requires that the contractor track and report customer satisfaction results on number of room-nights available at each location. Please advise how the government believes that customers would know the actual number of room nights available at each property so that the contractor could report on such information?

A. Same answer as #5.

HSAR 3052.209-70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006) 

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

<DESC>1.  (Question) Does the Coast Guard own any load testing software tools?  (Answer)NO, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY LOAD TESTING SOFTWARE AND/OR TOOLS. THIS WILL NEED TO BE LICENSED AND PROVIDED BY THE VENDOR.

2.  (Question)It looks like the Coast Guard has in mind that this can all be done in 2 weeks? (Answer)I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE IDEA OF 2 WEEKS CAME FROM. IT DOESN'T STATE HOW LONG IN THE STATEMENT OF WORK. THE PREP WORK (INSTALLING THE LOAD TESTING SOFTWARE, TESTING, GETTING FAMILIAR WITH OUR PRODUCT, ETC.) WILL BE WHATEVER THE VENDOR DEEMS NECESSARY TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE ACTUAL LOAD TESTING. THE ACTUAL LOAD TESTING WILL BE DONE DURING ONE WEEKEND.

3.  (Question) Is the total to be Tested at 500, 1,000 or 1,500?  What is the official goal?  (Answer)OUR GOAL IS TO LOAD TEST THE SYSTEM UNTIL IT BREAKS AND TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF USERS THE SYSTEM WILL HANDLE.

4.  (Question) Theres no description of the complexity and number of test cases.  Depending on the complexity and size of the application the testing process could take 3 hours or 3 years; its impossible to say.  Load testing is essentially executing on a test plan, and so a plan needs to be developed in order to come up with a cost estimate.  I can do something ad-hoc, but I still need to know how users interact with the system. (Answer)OUR GOAL IS TO LOAD TEST THE SYSTEM UNTIL IT BREAKS AND TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF USERS THE SYSTEM WILL HANDLE. THE TEST PLAN WILL BE DEVELOPED BY THE VENDOR. THE SYSTEM CURRENTLY HAS OVER 7000 ACTIVE USERS; HOWEVER, APPROXIMATELY 400 OF THEM CONCURRENTLY ACCESS THE SYSTEM AT ANY ONE TIME.

5.  (Question) Is the application accessible remotely, either over the open internet, or through a VPN?  If so, the testing could be done remotely, and would thus be cheaper than having someone on-site. (Answer)FOR VENDOR PURPOSES, THE APPLICATION IS ONLY AVAILABLE HERE ON SITE.

Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached. 

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

Since 2001, USAID/OFDA has provided more than $180.8 million in humanitarian assistance programs addressing needs of returning populations, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and other vulnerable or drought-affected rural populations.  Funded activities have included the provision of emergency relief supplies; support for food and agricultural needs; improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure; improved coordination and information sharing among humanitarian agencies; and the establishment of livelihoods opportunities and income generation projects.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, USAID/OFDA supported three emergency assistance programs, valued at nearly $17 million, including urban shelter and settlements activities in Kabul, emergency winter assistance to vulnerable Afghans, and support for increased production of certified seed.  

According to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), most of the estimated 1.2 million IDPs displaced under the Taliban regime, have returned home.  As of early 2007, UNHCR estimated the protracted IDP caseload at 130,000 people, displaced due to insecurity, drought, landlessness, and tribal conflict.  An estimated 29,000 people were displaced during 2007, primarily from Kandahar, Helmand, Uruzgan, and Zabul provinces in the south and Heart and Badghis provinces in the west.  No precise tallies of the number of current IDPs exist.  Although displacements often occur following outbreaks of fighting, UNHCR noted that most IDPs displaced by fighting return to areas of origin once the situation stabilizes.  Approximately 21 percent of all IDPs and refugee returnees to Afghanistan since 2002more than one of every fivehave moved to two of Afghanistans 398 provincial districts: Kabul and Bagrami districts in Kabul Province, which are located within Kabul Municipality (KM).  An additional 14 percent of all returning refugees have moved to other districts of Kabul Province since 2002, including portions of KM.

OBJECTIVE

The Europe, Middle East and Central Asia regional team (EMCA) requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor to be based in Kabul, Afghanistan, to ensure that OFDAs objectives for disaster assistance, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Kabul, and, subject to U.S. security considerations, willing to travel within and outside of Afghanistan on short notice for up to two-three weeks at a time, or longer.  The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Afghanistan, as well as for other disaster risk reduction and training programs.  The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/Afghanistan Mission, international organizations (IOs), non governmental organizations (NGOs), the United Nations (U.N.) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-led forces where appropriate, to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will be responsible for program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA Washington, USAIDs Regional Missions, as required, and U.S. Embassy staff. 

The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will serve as the primary point of contact for OFDA implementing partners working in Afghanistan and will monitor, evaluate and report on OFDA-funded programs while helping to coordinate with other USAID-funded programs.   This position requires substantial coordination with representatives from other USAID offices, the Government of Afghanistan (GOA), U.S. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), as well as with relevant U.N. agencies and NGOs, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  

Working under the guidance of USAID/Afghanistan and the additional guidance and supervision of the Regional Coordinator for EMCA at OFDA/Washington, the incumbent will:

	Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in Afghanistan for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues among the USAID mission, U.S. Embassy, NATO-led coalition forces, OFDA/Washington and the overall humanitarian community.
	Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDAs programs in Afghanistan.  
	Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance landscape in Afghanistan.  Regularly review partners reports, coordinate with OFDA/Washington on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated Washington and field feedback to the partners.
	Coordinate closely with OFDA/Washington, the USAID Mission, PRTs, U.S. Embassy in Kabul, and NATO Forces as well as the U.N. and NGO agencies working in Afghanistan.
	Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:
o	Capacity and level of activity of indigenous institutions to carry out relief programs;
o	Capacity and ability of UN, IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;
o	Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;
o	Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;
o	Impact of GOA activities on humanitarian programs; 
o	Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA; and  
o	Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.
	Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDAs Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/ Washington.
	Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and U.N. agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies and priorities, including OFDAs approach to humanitarian protection.  Work closely with OFDA/Washington to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.
	Visit OFDA-funded projects, as security permits, and report on a timely basis to  OFDA/Washington on the quality of grantees work, noting deficiencies, attributes, and evolving operational conditions.  
	Represent U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian interests at national and international meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.
	Maintain regular liaison with U.N., NGOs, IOs, the GOA, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.
	Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with OFDA/Washington.  
	Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as humanitarian protection and coordination.
	Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary, including monthly official reporting cables or as the situation warrants.
	Ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA Regional Coordinator for the Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia Region in Washington.  However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/Afghanistan, and in collaboration and consultation with other USAID and U.S. embassy staff.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from the EMCA Regional Coordinator.   

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.  The EMCA Regional Advisor, presently based in Washington, D.C., will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary. However, the incumbent should be prepared for a potentially physically demanding environment, which could include the need to evacuate an area on foot.  During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds) as well as wearing of protective gear.  OFDA staff serving in Afghanistan are strongly encouraged to maintain their physical well being. The USAID compound offers several options including a fitness center and pool. Walking and jogging within the compound is also an option.

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Most work activities take place in an office setting, although a fair amount of work can take place outside of the office, including visits to counterpart offices and project sites in Kabul, trips to various governorates, as allowed by security, and/or travel to Washington, D.C., for consultation and meetings with USG and partners.  During site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

12.  START DATE:  Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.

13.  POINT OF CONTACT:  See Cover Letter.

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement only.  This synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of the 55th Contracting Squadron to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:  This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing systems engineering and technical services with emphasis on precise Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) technologies and operational support to the Joint Navigational Warfare Center (JNWC).  JNWC is the Department of Defenses focal point for Navwar.   JNWC will operate as a coordinating organization between organizations responsible for operating Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Systems, maximizing the protection of the systems for the warfighter, preventing the use of systems by the enemy, and integrating capability with U.S. Government agencies (e.g. Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation) and coalition/allied partners.  
The mission of the Joint Navigational Warfare Center is to provide operational-level joint warfighter support through planning, integrating and coordinating navigational warfare (Navwar) policy and activities within and across geographic Areas of Responsibility (AOR), functional communities and DoD organizations in coordination with HQ STRATCOM.  The JNWC provides Navwar support to the combatant commanders Navwar operational planning and execution responsibilities, current and timely Navwar information to the warfighter, and participates in Service and joint training and exercise events globally.  Functions include independent Navwar testing, demonstrations, experiments, and assessments.  The JNWC develops, maintains and disseminates standards for Navwar analytical tools and methods, and develops and maintains Navwar modeling and simulation expertise for the DoD.  The JNWC has been designated as the sole repository of Navwar research, development, experimentation and development, and will function as an Information Analysis Center (IAC) to consolidate research, scientific and technical analysis on Navwar topics.  The requirement for this expertise is most notable in the engineering and analysis support provided, where the contractor will assess the performances of military weapon systems in Navwar environment, and then generate reports and studies that may provide advice both on the use of the weapon system, and on future engineering upgrades of the system.   The JNWC customer base includes joint and coalition warfighter, mission planners, tactics developers, system developers and testers.

<p>NAICS CODE: 541712</p>
<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/RV)</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE: Plug-and-Play (PnP) Spacecraft Technologies</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement (One Step)</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER: BAA-RV-09-01</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND TIME: Proposals for all areas will be due by 12:00 p.m., Mountain Time, 17 Feb 2009 delivered to 2251 Maxwell Ave SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5773. Proposals received after this due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c) (3). It should be noted that this installation observes strict security procedures to enter the facility. These security procedures are NOT considered an interruption of normal Government processes, and proposals received after the above stated date and time as a result of security delays will be considered "late". Furthermore, note that if offerors utilize commercial carriers in the delivery of proposals, they may not honor time-of-day delivery guarantees on military installations. Early proposal submission is encouraged.</p>
<p>BRIEF PROGRAM SUMMARY: The Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/RV) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the performance of research, development, and design, to support the development of plug-and-play technology for spacecraft systems including busses, components, payloads and flight and ground software. AFRL intends for this solicitation to be used as a means to develop plug-and-play (PnP) technology for space systems. It is anticipated that multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with a shared ceiling will be awarded with period of performance of 60 months. One subsequent task order is anticipated to include the development of a PnP Spacecraft Bus (TacSat-5). The full BAA announcement can be accessed at the FedBiz Ops website: http://www.fbo.gov and in the event this announcement is amended.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED PROGRAM COST: Funding has been identified up to $200M from FY09 to FY14. Task Orders will be issued for Five Years (5) from award of the contract.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: This acquisition is unrestricted. This BAA is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation paragraph 6.102(d)(2) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition In Contracting Act of 1984. There will be no other announcement issued for this requirement.</p>
<p>TYPE OF CONTRACTS/INSTRUMENTS: The Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation or Other Transaction (OT) for Prototype/ Research. It is anticipated that awards under this BAA will generally be IDIQ contracts with the initial task order being a FFP Level of Effort (FFP LOE) and the subsequent task orders being Cost Plus Fixed Fee or other contract type(s) required to fulfill a need to support the program, which require successful offerors to have an accounting system considered adequate for tracking costs applicable to the contract.</p>
<p>ON-LINE REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS: Potential offerors are notified that effective 01 Jan 2005 to be eligible for an award, they must submit annual Electronic Representations and Certifications, otherwise known as On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) via the Business Partner Network (BPN) at http://www.bpn.gov/orca . These FAR level representations and certifications are required in addition to the representations and certifications specific to this acquisition. Before submitting the Electronic Representations and Certifications, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database. On-line registration instructions can be accessed from the DISA CCR home page at http://www.ccr.gov .</p>
<p><br />ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF AWARDS: The Air Force anticipates awarding a minimum of one contract. However, the Air Force does reserve the right to make multiple awards or no awards pursuant to this BAA.</p>

<DESC>Below are questions that DDC received from a contractor concerning this solicitation, and DDC's responses to those questions.

Question No. 1: The temporary toilet facility shown on Drawing A-101 makes no reference of needing the Unisex portion to be ADA compliant, is this a requirement?

Response to Question No. 1: No

Question No. 2:  Also in the notes for the toilet facility it is to be self-contained, unless this project is not started until late spring the unit will require heat. The 20 amp breaker that we are to use to supply power to the temporary toilet will not be sufficient to run both the lights and heat. Please advise.

Response to Question No. 2:  The Electrical Engineer for the project was aware of the power requirement for a unit as specified and is aware of an available unit (lights and heat included) that will run off of the power source to be supplied.

There is no change to the closing date for this solicitation (closing date for submittal of quotes is still January 23, 2009).

The closing date for receipt of proposals is January 15, 2009 (unless changed by an official amendment to the solicitation). The solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis using full and open competitive procedures. The procurement will be conducted using source selection procedures and the award will be based on the best value to the Government considering price and non-price factors cited in this announcement and the solicitation. Any resulting contract will be firm-fixed price. NAICS Code: 236220 with a current size standard of $33,500,000. The Federal Supply Code is Y163. Offerors are advised that a contract resulting from this solicitation is contingent upon funding and Congressional approval.

If a large business is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirements for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The FY08 subcontracting goals for this contract are a minimum of 70.0% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses, 6.2% of that to small disadvantaged businesses, 7.0% to woman-owned small businesses, 9.8% to HUBzone small businesses, and 3.0% to veteran-owned small business, and 0.9% to service disabled veteran-owned small business.

We advise contractors to begin this process when they prepare their proposal in order to ensure registration is in place should they be selected for the award.

This acquisition is a 1-Phase solicitation where performance capability and price are evaluated in a single phase. SELECTION CRITERIA: Award will be based on the Best Value approach. Offerors will be evaluated based upon the following non-price evaluation factor: Performance Capability to include: specialized experience; past performance; proposed contract duration and summary schedule; key personnel capabilities and experience; small business utilization; and Price. The Subcontracting Plan required for Large Businesses will be evaluated on a Go/No Go basis. The overall non-price evaluation rating is considered more important than price.

<DESC>*********THIS MODIFICATION IS TO CORRECT THE EMAIL AND WEBSITE ADDRESS FOR AMSCA********This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the United States Army Test and Evaluation Command  (ATEC) Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate (ABNSOTD). The purpose of this Notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The ABNSOTD welcomes Corporate Capability Statements from all individuals and organizations. ATEC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or ABNSOTDs use of such information. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of ABNSOTDs evaluation of the information received. As a result of this Notice, the ATEC may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP). However, should such a requirement fail to materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this Notice.<BR><BR>Scope:<BR><BR>The purpose of this notice is to seek possible vendors capable of enhancing the design, development, and production for the Geometric Automated Video Enhanced Location System (GAVELS), a one-of-a-kind Government system.   The GAVELS system was originally developed in 1998 by Integrated Sensors Incorporated (ISI) of Utica, NY, which is no longer in business.<BR><BR>GAVELS is used to locate exploding artillery rounds and to track parachute<BR>airdrop items, including personnel and cargo, using the Universal Transverse<BR>Mercator (UTM) coordinates and altitude. The system has one major subsystem that records events or targets using digital video and records vital<BR>information such as GPS time, event number, and other information the user<BR>desires to include on each frame. The event must be recorded with multiple<BR>video cameras in order to calculate position using triangulation techniques.<BR>A second analysis subsystem uses the information from the camera sites and<BR>associates them with the GPS time as the common attribute.<BR><BR>The existing GAVELS employs Government owned software which must be modified, updated or replaced as necessary to accommodate new cameras, facilitate improved accuracy and improve usability.  Factors to consider in terms of improving usability must include all processes involved in setting up for test, collecting data and data reduction.  The contractor must also integrate new hardware and software into a complete, functional system. The intention of the enhancement is to make the system more accurate, easier to use and add the capability to use it during night tests.<BR><BR>The system enhancement will be conducted in a phased approach.  Phase 1A will be a design phase to include the development of a comprehensive system Enhancement Plan.  In Phase 1A, the primary tasks are to analyze the current GAVELS system capabilities and weigh those capabilities against the requirements; develop an Enhancement Plan; and design, build and demonstrate a prototype as a proof-of-concept.  Phase 1B will include producing and testing the system designed in Phase 1A.   The comprehensive Enhancement Plan will also include planning for follow-on phases to include planning for sustainment.  Due to this phased approach, it is crucial that the system be designed in an open and upgradeable architecture to facilitate the planned improvements.<BR><BR>Additional information about the GAVELS system is posted to the AMSCA website: https://www.amsca.atec.army.mil.<BR><BR>Any interested organizations should submit the Corporate Capability Statement which demonstrates the firms ability and interest in no more than 20 pages to perform the key requirements described above.
