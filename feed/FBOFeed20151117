<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541513 with a small business size standard of $27.5 million dollars. <br /><br />AFRL requires the purchase of profile migration support from a Mailroom system to the Decision Agent ITS Gateway (DA I-Gate) commercial off the shelf system currently being deployed to the White House Communications Agency (WHCA). The contractor shall provide technical assistance to migrate a total of about 500 existing profiles from the White House Situation Room (WHSR) stand-alone Mailroom system to the WHCA DA I-Gate system and modify the existing output formatting (ATGs) to support the ITS information. <br /><br />The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Northrop Grumman Information System (NGIS) 2340 Dulles Corner Blvd Herndon, VA 20171-3400.<br /><br />The Government has determined that no other source can meet this state of the art requirement; as the DA I-Gate system is a Northrop Grumman proprietary commercial-off-the-shelf system that is developed and licensed through NGIS, the profile migration support required is also proprietary and only offered through NGIS, there are no other vendors who can provide these services and these services are required by WHCA to ensure ITS information is properly disseminated to WHSR.<br /><br />This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to <a href="mailto:Brooke.Hoffman@us.af.mil">Brooke.Hoffman@us.af.mil</a>. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.<br />Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 31 January 2016.<br /><br />A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award.<br />

<DESC>Inu Teq, LLC has a requirement for the purchase to upgrade the current Tecom Communications Dish utilized by the DATR to provide UHF Communications. One (1) each System NRE for the new design to interface to Tecom Pedestal, One (1) each Rack Mount inside Riser extension Pedestal Interface Unit with GFE PCB and Power Module, One (1) each Custom Slip Ring Assembly, One (1) each Internal Pedestal Cabling, One (1) each Systems integration, Documentation Package, FATP & 1 day SATP, One (1) each Camera over MM Fiber, 36X Optical Zoom, F 3.3 to 119mm. Auto/Man focus. Camera Mounting Bracket. Inu Teq, LLC intends to purchase the items from Telemetry Communications Systems, 10020 Remmet Avenue, Chatsworth, California 91311. This is a follow on procurement upgrading an existing highly specialized communications antenna. The integration of a new ACU-M1 requires the modification of proprietary software and hardware throughout that existing system, and procurement through another vendor would require significant duplication of costs at the antenna and antenna controller. Procurement falls under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements (10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)).

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) - Wheelchair Washer Installation

Introduction and Overview: This Statement of Work is to relocate and install a wheelchair washer and the removal of a large station scale.   

Background: The scale in need of removal is a large 2,000 lb. inlaid, Detecto station scale.  The wheelchair washer is an Aqua Phase AQ4000 sealed washer.  The Wheelchair Washer's total Outer Dimensions are: Width 63 "  Length 96 3/4 , Height 73". Effective Chamber Dimensions-Width 40 " Length-93 ".  Height 93 "

Objectives: VAMC Northport's wheelchair washer, once installed, will allow the station to clean our rolling stock in-house without seeking the services of an outside contractor.  This will result in significant savings for Veterans Affairs.

Period of Performance: Contractor is expected to complete work within 45 days of award.

Place of Performance: Building 200, Scale Room near loading dock area.

Scope of Work: The scope is to install a wheelchair washer and remove a large station scale. After removal of the scale, the area must be filled in with rebar and cement to make level with existing floor.  The double doors in this area must be removed to install the new wheelchair washer.  Connect electric to existing electrical outlets.  Connect water supply to existing water lines.  Test unit operation after installation.

Safety Codes: It will be expected that VAMC safety codes will be adhered to with the hardware to be installed.  Installers should follow safety guidelines pertaining to professional code standards. 

Special Material Requirements: The Aqua Phase wheelchair washer, once relocated, needs hookups to two hoses-one for hot water and one for drain.  The Aqua Phase 4000 will then have to be connected to the appropriate power source.  

Type of Procurement:
The responses to this Request for Information (RFI) will help determine what, if any, type of set-aside.

Contract Vehicle:
The resulting contract vehicles from this process will be a firm fixed price.

<DESC>THIS REQUIREMENT WAS ORIGINALLY SYNOPSIZED VIA PRESOLICITATION NOTICE POSTED ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2015, UNDER SOLICITATION NUMBER R15PS00175.  PRESOLICITATION NOTICE FOR R15PS00175 WAS MODIFIED ON NOVEMBER 03, 2015, TO ADVISE A CHANGE TO THE SOLICITATION NUMBER FOR THIS REQUIREMENT FROM R15PS00175 TO R16PS00076, AS WELL AS TO CHANGE THE ANTICIPATED REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) DATE FROM SEPTEMBER 30, 2015, TO NOVEMBER 16, 2015.  WITH THIS MODIFICATION ON NOVEMBER 17, 2015, THE ANTICIPATED REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) DATE IS CHANGED FROM NOVEMBER 16, 2015, TO FEBRUARY 01, 2016.  ATTENTION IS ALSO DIRECTED TO SOLICITATION NUMBER R16PS00086, FOR A SIMILAR AND MORE IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENT, TITLED 'UPPER NV INTERIOR LATERAL SPOT COATING REPAIR, HOOVER DAM, NEVADA'.

Protective Coating IDIQ for Hoover Dam, Hoover Dam, Arizona - Nevada. 

The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Lower Colorado Region, has a requirement for the application of protective coatings to mitigate corrosion on steel and cast steel surfaces on turbine generators, steel structures, water tanks and various power plant equipment at Hoover Dam.  The work is located at Hoover Dam, on the Colorado River, approximately 7 miles northeast of Boulder City, Nevada, and 32 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, in Clark County, Nevada and Mohave County, Arizona. There may also be task orders issued for two other facilities on the Lower Colorado River, one at Davis Dam which operates in Nevada/Arizona and the other at Parker Dam which operates in Arizona/California.

The areas of steel to be coated vary depending on the work schedule.  In some years, less than one hundred square feet per year is coated, whereas in other years thousands of square feet are coated in a single year.  Due to time constraints, it is often necessary to schedule coating work into specific calendar timeframes to insure that coating does not interfere with other critical-path major maintenance schedules at Hoover Dam.

The work includes, but is not limited to, the following: 

(1) Furnishing, erecting and relocating scaffolding system for the external 30-foot diameter and 25-foot diameter penstock sections; both interior and exterior surfaces. 

(2) Furnishing, erecting and relocation scaffolding system for the external 13-foot diameter penstock laterals. The 13-foot diameter laterals in the lower penstocks are nearly horizontal.  However, the upper penstock 13-foot diameter laterals slope at an angle of 45 degrees. Each lateral is nearly 275 feet long. Work to include interior and exterior surfaces. 

(3) Furnishing, erecting and relocating scaffolding systems for the scroll cases, outlet work piping, steel water tanks, steel support towers, intake towers, draft-tube stop logs, intake gates and numerous other steel hydro facilities. 
	
(4) Coating removal, surface preparation, and coating of damaged areas in the interior and exterior of 30-foot diameter and 25-foot diameter penstock, outlet works piping and 13-foot diameter penstock sections, as well as the structures mentioned in item (3) directly above.

(5) Surface preparation and furnishing and applying protective coating for isolated spot repair of damaged areas. In certain cases, the work will be 100% removal and replacement and be determined by individual task orders.

(6) Control of leakage water, odors, pollutants and waste when applicable.

(7) Water blasting is the required coating removal method to control odors for Visitors Center and Powerhouse. The Visitors Center and the Powerhouse both use penstock tunnels as the source of building ventilation air. Sandblasting or needle-scaling methods will be approved on a case-by-case basis only when the contractor is able to control the atmosphere to breathing air standards.

(8) Waste management and mitigation is a requirement. Due to the age of the facilities, many steel structures have lead based paint and primers, which must follow Hazmat Regulations for exposure and mitigation.

(9) Work may also include other steel structural components such as towers, tanks, spillway gates and intake gates, which all require special equipment and procedures.

This solicitation is Unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 238320 Painting and Wall Covering Contractors, which has a small business size standard of $15M.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE: The objective of this contract is to acquire contractor services to provide non-personnel Phase I Environmental Site Assessment(s)(ESA) services, over a five year period, and required reports within 30 days of a Task Order being placed. It may also include a Phase II process based on the results of the Phase I determination. Federal law [40 CFR 312] requires that federal agencies perform a Phase I ESA which provides for due diligence or all appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of a real property. This is an effort to identify potential liability and risk associated with environmental and public health considerations concerning a property or real estate transaction. A Phase I ESA addresses the potential for or actual release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminates. It evaluates readily-available evidence to determine whether substances, pollutants, or contaminates may be located on or under the property surface, and attempts to determine if existing conditions may violate known, applicable environmental laws or regulations. The results of the inquiry are issued in the Phase I ESA report.  The work to be performed under this contract will be at locations throughout the State of Utah and will be identified on each Task Order that is issued. Most of the work will be performed in the following counties: Utah, Salt Lake, Summit, Wasatch, Duchesne, Uintah and Juab; however, work may be assigned in any country within the State of Utah. A determination that includes substances, pollutants or contaminates of the property may result in a Phase II process for further testing and a separate task order may be issued. COMPETITION: Solicitation R15PS001782 is anticipated to be a total small business Set-Aside.  The requirement shall be procured in accordance FAR 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures as a 5 year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract.  
NAICS AND SIZE STANDARD: The NAICS code for this project is 541620 with a small business size standard of $15 million.

Interested parties are encouraged to monitor this announcement for updates and the release of the solicitation documents.  The solicitation documents for this procurement will be accessible from the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, www.fbo.gov. It is, and will continue to be, all potential offeror's responsibility to monitor the FBO website for any amendments, updates, responses to questions and answers, etc. as the Government will not be providing any other methods of information dissemination.

<DESC>Item Description: NSN 2815-01-385-6803- Cylinder Sleeve Kit, bought in accordance with Cummins Inc. (15434) part number 3803447. Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item with 15 days of this notice. The required quantity is 430 kits with a 100% option shipping to (W25G1U) New Cumberland, PA 17070-5002. This solicitation is being issued under the First Destination Transportation (FDT) program. FOB origin and inspection at destination are required. This solicitation will be available on the internet at http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp after the issue date of 07/30/15. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery and past performance. The required delivery is 165 days. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. All interested parties may submit an offer.<br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br />Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. E-mailed proposal shall not be transmitted directly to the contracting officer. Submit e-mailed proposals to the Bid and Abstract Room at: ContractorProposalDLALandandMaritime@dla.mil. E-mailed proposals cannot exceed 15MB.<br />

Contractor shall provide current software updates to the operating system and shall provide Carl Zeiss parts and accessories if required during service.</p>
<p>These Carl Zeiss confocal instruments were designed by Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC and require professional maintenance including scheduled service visits and periodic part replacement. Zeiss confocal models have internal components and mechanisms that are proprietary and thus, Carl Zeiss LLC is the only known source capable of fulfilling the service contract on these instruments. <br />Carl Zeiss service engineers have the highest qualification for repairing the Zeiss confocal microscopes; they are specially trained in Germany on the latest models of the instrument. Carl Zeiss holds multiple patents on these instruments and is the sole source of most of the replacement parts. The parts of the confocal instrument require special handling and this handling needs the approval of Carl Zeiss in order to obtain warranty replacements. CCR is constantly upgrading this confocal system with the newest versions of their software and hardware; these new pieces require fine-tuning, which is only available if done as part of the service contract. <br /><br />Furthermore, only a Zeiss maintenance agreement provides access to unlimited phone support and onsite training by qualified service engineers and application specialists including preparation of macros for specialized experiments. Such support and continuous training are essential because of the sophistication level of the equipment. A maintenance agreement also guarantees elective enhancements and upgrades to existing equipment followed by complete performance check of the entire system. In addition to this, a maintenance agreement with Zeiss covers reinstallation of software if necessary. For the aforementioned reasons, Carl Zeiss is the only known source for this procurement.<br /><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The responses and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 AM EST on December 2, 2015. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed 240-276-5401 or emailed to Reyes Rodriguez, Contracting Officer at reyes.rodriguez@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) through the System for Awards Management (sam.gov). No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number N02RC62510-57 on all correspondence.</p>

For a complete list of all items to be repaired or any questions concerning this notice, contact Robert Devlin, N722.05, 215-697-5841).

The subject items require Government Source Approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
  Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for repair of these items has been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the U.S. Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure (available at: https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx).  This brochure identifies the technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in repair of the same or similar item(s), or if your company has never repaired the same or similar item(s). If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this procurement.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<p>Offered buildings must be located within 1,320 walkable linear feet (wlf) from a light rail station measured along accessibility compliant, paved pedestrian pathways from a main entrance of the offered building to the accessibility compliant entrance to the light rail station.  Offered buildings must have an existing LEED Gold or Platinum certification, under either the LEED-NC rating system, the LEED for Building Design and Construction: New Construction and Major Renovations (LEED BD+C: New Construction) rating system or the LEED for Building Operations and Maintenance: Existing Buildings (LEED O+M: Existing Buildings) rating system.

In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this notification.  In the event that a potentially acceptable offer fails to provide required information as part of its response to this notification, the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Submission by anyone other than the owner or manager of a property must be accompanied by a letter from the ownership granting permission to make a general offering of space.  In instances where the Offeror is representing more than one property, the Offeror is hereby notified that they may only participate in negotiations on behalf of one owner.</p>

<strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">INFORMATION REQUESTED:</p>
</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">(a) Background: The Government is conducting market research to identify possible sources that may possess the expertise, experience, and capabilities to schedule, manage and modify HC/MC-130J aircraft. Upgrades add multiple capabilities to achieve new HC/MC-130J Block configurations. Possible activities include:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. Install: crew station hardware, additional processing/computer hardware (for running unique mission software) and larger displays<strong></strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">2. Install a federated aircraft system</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">3. Install a secure mission network and communication suite</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">4. Install cargo ramp side anti-buffeting boards</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">5. Install significant capability upgrades (Block modifications)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Contractors will be dealing with unclassified systems, 3rd party proprietary applications, and system architectures that will require confidentiality agreements; identify your ability and any inability to obtain nondisclosure agreements.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">(b) Roughly 50 aircraft will require modification at a planned rate of 4-6 ea. per year, funding availability may increase or decrease this number. Some individual modifications may be conducted at a flexible rate depending on parts availability and funding. Record type Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO's) will be used as instruction for performing modifications with access to available engineering drawings. Some modifications may require support from the Original Equipment Manufacturer when technical data is not readily available. Modifications do not require hangar facilities; however, access to an on-site hangar large enough to support an HC/MC-130J is desired. Completion of some Block modifications may require a limited Functional Check Flight (FCF). Possessing the capability to perform a FCF is not required; however, documentation of how you will arrange for a qualified FCF aircrew must be included.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">(c) Purpose: The purpose of this RFI is to assist the program office with ascertaining interest in competing for a single modification event that involves multiple TCTO's, to gain synergy and avoid downtime. Interested parties should respond to this RFI with capability statements which include/address the following information:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. Describe your past experience of like activities (no more than five examples) to include:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">a) Program name and branch of service responsible for management of program</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">b) Description of the effort</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">c) Date and period of performance</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">d) Contract information (number, POP, POC etc.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2. Respondents to this RFI should assume the Government will be unable to provide a complete complement of HC/MC-130J support equipment (SE) required for sustainment of the aircraft during modification activities. Respondents should fully explain how they plan to obtain SE. Respondents should define how HC/MC-130J equipment and technical data will be stored /safeguarded to prevent unauthorized access and/or disclosure.<strong></strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">3. Respondents should identify their organizations ability to accommodate changes, their flexibility to increase/decrease quantities and timeliness to add scope. Additionally, the Government is interested in respondents' disposition towards accommodating third-party access during modification activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">4. Respondents should briefly describe their internal quality assurance process. If respondent intends to make teaming arrangements to meet requirements, the RFI response should identify potential teaming arrangements and roles and responsibilities. The prime contractor will be responsible for the overall performance of this effort.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">5. Responses should address any risks foreseen in performing this effort. Respondents should address any steps they would likely take to mitigate the risks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">6. Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a Historically Underutilized Business zone small business concern, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Native American-Owned Small Business, and should also indicate if the company is foreign-owned.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">(d) RFI Format: Interested sources must respond with a complete RFI package of no more than 10 pages, providing all information requested above. All parties are asked to provide a point of contact, a telephone number, and an e-mail address in their response.</p>
<p>(e) Date Response required and Point of Contact: Responses should be received no later than 30 days from date of RFI submission. Responses should be sent electronically to Kevin.Bridges.1@us.af.mil; Ms. Katherine Hamblin at katherine.hamblin@us.af.mil; and Keith Pfeffer at keith.pfeffer@us.af.mil. One Hard copy should be provided to AFLCMC/WISK, 1895 5th Street; Room 210 WPAFB OH 45433. Technical questions concerning this RFI should be directed to Mr. Kevin Bridges (937-656-8511).</p>

<SUBJECT>Market Survey for Request for Information (RFI) in support of Software Defined Radio Software Interoperability, Operation and Sustainment
<SOLNBR>W15P7T16R0007
<RESPDATE>120715
<CONTACT>Michael M. Gomes, Phone 4438614967, Email michael.m.gomes.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><p>1.0 Purpose<br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gain knowledge of and help the Government understand vendor interest in providing software lifecycle support for the Department of Army (DA) Software Defined Radio (SDR) marketplace. This market survey is also to understand vendor interest and insights in maintaining SDR network interoperability in this marketplace that includes SDR terminals developed under government development contracts and industry innovation through internal investments. Information gathered from this survey will assist the Government in determining the acquisition strategy for SDR networking software in various phases of the product lifecycle (e.g. development - SDR integration - testing - fielding - sustainment). The Government's intent is to enable a mature SDR networking marketplace based on the most enhanced, operationally relevant, and sustainable tactical waveforms, Radio Frequency (RF) network services, and RF network management software available. The Government is currently contemplating a Multiple Award - Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (MA-IDIQ) contract with a base ordering period of five (5) years and an optional ordering period of five (5) years. <br />The information provided and received in response to this announcement is subject to the conditions set forth in FAR 52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes.<br />2.0 Background<br />The Product Manager Waveforms (PdM WF) office is a critical piece of the Program Executive Office Command Control Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) Project Manager Tactical Radios (PM TR) system portfolio focused on the delivery and sustainment of the lower and middle tier tactical RF networks for the DA. In order to enable and maintain network interoperability for tactical RF networks, PdM WF implemented a dual acquisition strategy that included government laboratories focused on SDR network management and terminal testing/certification in parallel with acquiring industry support in the development and sustainment for SDR network software products and services (e.g. Software In-Service Sustainment or SwISS). For Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) interoperability, PdM WF coordinates with the Navy's MUOS program office on SDR network and terminal testing/certification. PdM WF is investigating the optimum strategy to synchronize the fielding of enhanced or new tactical waveforms across all of the PM TR portfolio of SDRs. <br />3.0 Requested Information<br />Interested vendors are invited to submit their prospective approach to include a description of the required software/hardware to meet the requirements listed in this section (3.0). Additionally, each vendor should provide a list of anticipated challenges (e.g. data right restrictions, intellectual property restrictions) and their prospective approach in assisting the Government in maintaining SDR network interoperability. Include corporate experiences, validation and/or verification data to allow for the Government to assess the maturity of any included technology, methodologies or processes. RFI anticipated requirements include:<br />(1) Maintain SDR networking waveforms (Soldier Radio Waveform-SRW, Wideband Networking Waveform-WNW, MUOS, Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System-SINCGARS, Ultra High Frequency Satellite Communication-UHF SATCOM) post Initial Operational Capability in a streamlined manner that allows for individual system Engineering Change Proposals and industry innovation but allows the Government to affordably manage SDR terminal interoperability<br />(2) Enhance SDR networks (networking and legacy), network services (e.g. Enterprise-Over The Air Management-OTAM) and network management software tools (e.g. Joint Enterprise Network Manager-JENM) in a manner that allows the government to distribute SDR network changes to other SDR terminal vendors to maintain terminal interoperability<br />(3) Introduction of new capabilities on existing SDR networks, network services and network management software tools synchronized across all PM TR SDR terminals. (e.g. SRW Narrowband, Coalition Wideband Networking Waveform)<br />(4) Support a robust SDR marketplace by (i) ensuring sufficient government data rights and configuration control of SDR network waveforms, network services and network management software and associated development tools, (ii) developing software and design artifacts to maximize portability (including the Software Communication Architecture and Application Programmable Interfaces), (iii) supporting a common development environment(s) that is readily available to the DA SDR Industry, and (iv) delivery of all artifacts to the Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) Information Repository (IR)<br />(5) Adhere to a streamlined approach to meeting National Security Agency Information Assurance requirements and DA Risk Management Framework security requirements<br />(6) Ensure rigorous technology protection practices are adhered to during all phases of the product life-cycle. <br />(7) Support government configuration management of SDR networks, network services and network management software tools in an effective and efficient manner.</p>
<p>4.0 Submission Instructions and Format<br />Responses shall not be above the level of Unclassified//For Official Use Only (FOUO). <br />Interested vendors are invited to respond to this market survey by providing information in the following format: <br />(1) Name, address, and Cage Code of applicant/company (Corporate/Principal Office)<br />(2) Name, telephone number, and e-mail address of point of contact<br />(3) Label the cover page clearly with RFI title: "Software Defined Radio Software Interoperability, Operation and Sustainment Acquisition Strategy."<br />(4) Responses to this RFI shall be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) format (1-inch margins and 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font). All documents shall be submitted by email to the POC (included in Section 3.0) no later than 10:00 AM EST on 7 December 2015.<br />(5) Limit response to 20 pages, to include cover page and table of contents</p>
<p>Interested vendors should ensure that they address the following in their response:<br />(1) Summarized approach of how to solve the anticipated requirements listed in paragraph 3.0. <br />(2) Comment on the Government's consideration of a MA-IDIQ contract vehicle. <br />(3) Suggested contract type (Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF), Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF), Fixed-Price-Incentive-Firm (FPIF), Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), etc.) and rationale for each of the anticipated requirement listed in paragraph 3.0.<br />(4) Suggested Government Furnished Information (GFI) and/or Government Furnished Property (GFP) needed, if applicable.<br />(5) Any timeline recommendations (suggested period of performance, time from release of Request for Proposals (RFP) to proposal submission, etc.)</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals. PdM Waveforms is only seeking sources through market research at this time to determine industry interest in participating in software operation and sustainment for the DA SDR marketplace. The Government does not make any promise or guarantee that by submitting a response to this RFI that the vendor will be selected to participate. The Government will respect proprietary markings submitted for this market survey. The Government requests that vendors segregate and mark proprietary documents. The Government will provide the vendor with an acknowledgement of receipt of its response to this RFI. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this market survey or any follow-up information requests. Submittals will not be returned to the sender. If a vendor is interested in participating in this RFI but is not able to meet the submission parameters as stated below (section 5.0), please contact the POC for further guidance.</p>
<p>The Government intends to use contractor support in its review of RFI responses. Respondents that wish to execute Proprietary Data Protection Agreements (PDPA) and/or Non-Disclosure Agreements working this RFI must contact the POC and conclude agreements prior to the deadline for submission.</p>
<p>All questions and submissions regarding these anticipated requirements should be addressed to the Government Point of Contact (POC): <br />Michael Gomes<br />Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) <br />Phone: 443-861-4967<br />Email: Michael.m.gomes.civ@mail.mil</p>

<p><br />PROJECT DETAILS: CFL anticipates awarding three to five Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) for construction services for Gravel Roads.</p>
<p>CFL has a need for a rapid response road construction and repair contracting tool for repetitive 1R, 2R and 3R work on gravel roads in the Midwest and Inter-Mountain Regions. Projects primarily include improvements to low-volume and low-speed roadways. Projects may be located in environmentally sensitive areas that necessitate context-sensitive construction techniques and processes. The predominant geographic area includes Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas. These projects are primarily part of the Air Force Space Command OMAD program, the Refuge Road Program (RRP),) and to a lesser extent the Emergency Relief for Federally Owned Roads Program (ERFO) and the Forest Land Access Program (FLAP).</p>
<p>The government anticipates individual task orders ranging from $50,000 to $10,000,000.00. Potential contractors will be required to demonstrate bonding capacity of up to $10,000,000 per task order with a yearly aggregate capacity of up to $20,000,000. Bonding will only be required for individual task orders. Request for Task Order Proposals will include Davis Bacon wage determinations and specific plans and specs for the project.</p>
<p>The first Task Order Request for Proposals (TO-RFP) will be issued simultaneously with the MATOC Request for Proposal. Contractors will be required to submit a proposal for the first task order as well as the base MATOC RFP. The proposal for the first task order will be used to evaluate price for the best value MATOC RFP.</p>
<p>Contractor team must be able to demonstrate their ability to mobilize in all of the aforementioned states. Each contract awarded will consist of one base year and options to extend the contract for four additional one-year periods. The contract will have a maximum not-to-exceed five year total of $50 million. Each contract will operate with individually negotiated task orders issued in accordance with the terms of the contract. Task orders will be predominately for construction activities.</p>
<p>The scope of task orders may include, but are not limited to construction services including mobilization, contractor sampling and testing, production and placement of aggregate, roadway pulverization, roadway excavation, embankment construction, drainage improvements, placement of aggregate surface course, slope stabilization (MSE wall, gabions, etc.) minor asphalt surfacing and minor structural work.</p>
<p>This is a best value negotiated type procurement and evaluation factors for award are fully stated in the RFP which will be available as noted below. Evaluation factors will include Contract Team and Qualifications including organizational qualifications and key personnel, Contractor Past Performance, Financial capability and bonding capacity, location of Contractor headquarters, and QA/QC Program and Operations. The Government may award up to four contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose offers conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, technical, and other factors considered.</p>
<p>Tentative advertisement date is on or about January 1, 2016.</p>
<p><br />PLEASE NOTE: The Request for Proposals will be available for download on or about January 1, 2016, from the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION/SYNOPSIS
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics and devices, which is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts. <br />The evaluation of new and improved vaccine, therapeutic, diagnostic and device candidates in clinical trials and clinical studies is an essential element of DMID's efforts. Through an extensive network of grant and contract research programs, DMID supports a broad range of clinical research, including single-site and multi-center Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 4 (and occasionally Phase 3) clinical trials for the evaluation of bacterial, viral and parasitic vaccines, other biologics, drugs, diagnostics and devices as preventive, therapeutic, and diagnostic measures against infectious diseases in people of all ages and risk categories. Much of this clinical research is devoted to addressing critical public health needs, such as those related to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, including avian influenza and antimicrobial resistance, and those supporting the evaluation of safety and efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates against potential agents of bioterrorism, including NIAID priority biodefense pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm), <br />BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The purpose of this Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is to identify qualified small or small disadvantaged businesses, capable of and interested in performing the work described herein. The NIAID does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.</p>
<p>In August 2008, NIAID awarded a 7-year contract to Fisher BioServices Corporation (HHSN272200800044C) to provide for the operation of a Clinical Agent and Specimen Repository (CASR) that adheres to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP), for the acquisition, receipt, storage and shipping of clinical agents and clinical specimens in support of DMID-sponsored clinical trials and research programs in the U.S. and abroad and ensures that all work performed is done in compliance with federal and/or local clinical trial related regulations.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The anticipated solicitation will be for the management and operation of a cGMP-compliant clinical materials services facility including receipt, aliquoting, labeling, packaging, repackaging, shipping, acquiring, testing and disposing of clinical agents and clinical specimens. All work performed under the anticipated contract must be done in compliance with federal and/or local clinical trial related regulations.</p>
<p>Clinical agents include investigational study products (drugs, vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and devices), commercial products, placebos, syringes, and other protocol/Manual of Procedures (MOP)-mandated supplies to be used in DMID-sponsored clinical trials. Clinical specimens include sera or other protocol-mandated specimens obtained from DMID-approved clinical research sites, to be distributed or tested at DMID-approved testing laboratories.</p>
<p>Any awardee resulting from the anticipated solicitation will be transferred samples and data as part of initial transition activities. It is anticipated that on the effective date of the contract, 1,000,000 vials of specimen and 500,000 vials of product will need to be transferred. It is also anticipated that performance will require shipments to clinical trials in both domestic and foreign locales, for up to 100 trials. NIAID recognizes that a single organization or institution may not have the expertise and facilities required to perform all of the activities set forth in the Statement of Work and, consequently, that the Contractor may need to be supported to a certain extent by the expertise and resources of subcontractors to perform some of the tasks required. The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed under the anticipated contract including that performed by any subcontractor(s).</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The Government anticipates awarding one cost reimbursement, Level of Effort type award; with a one year base period of performance beginning on or around April 1, 2017. It is anticipated the award will include six (6) one-year Option Periods. The total potential period of performance, including options, will be seven years. The Government's base level of effort requirement is anticipated to be 20,325 labor hours per contract year. In addition to the base level of effort, each year of performance is anticipated to contain an option for 10,163 additional labor hours.</p>

<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.</p>
<p>The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which mission it is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.<br />The NCATS Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) is tasked with identifying and developing novel small molecule leads against a wide spectrum of human disease targets, which it accomplishes by screening thousands of small molecules in collaboration with both intra-and extramural researchers. In pursuit of this goal, the Center has a strong internal transdisciplinary team of scientists who continually discover novel small molecules for application against a wide range of human diseases.<br />Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase type-2 alpha (PIP4K2) catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns5P) on the fourth hydroxyl of the myo-inositol ring, to form phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2). It may exert its function by regulating the levels of PtdIns5P, which functions in the cytosol by increasing AKT activity and in the nucleus signals through ING2 and ay regulate the pool of cytosolic PtdIns5P in response to the activation of tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, PIP4K2 may also negatively regulate insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by lowering the levels of PtdIns5P and may be involved in thrombopoiesis, and the terminal maturation of megakaryocytes and regulation of their size.<br />Lysine-specific demethylase 5B (KDM5B) is a histone demethylase that demethylates 'Lys-4' of histone H3, thereby playing a central role in histone code. KDM5B does not demethylate histone H3 'Lys-9' or H3 'Lys-27'. It demethylates trimethylated, dimethylated and monomethylated H3 'Lys-4' and acts as a transcriptional corepressor for FOXG1B and PAX9. It favors the proliferation of breast cancer cells by repressing tumor suppressor genes such as BRCA1 and HOXA5. In contrast, KDM5B may act as a tumor suppressor for melanoma and represses the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer-mediated transcriptional activation of the core clock component PER2.<br />Both these proteins are of great interest to study for NCGC and hence, we seek to profile 5 proprietary compounds against these proteins (each) using surface plasmon resonance. We have previously worked with this vendor who developed a custom, proprietary method for running the SPR against another target, IDH1. The results were used as part of the CBC project and we now expect to continue using these precise services to allow for continuity of data.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this requirement is to obtain bioanalytical testing services to characterize PIP4K2 and KDM5B and then assess 5 compounds for each protein.</p>
<p>The vendor shall characterized ATP, ADP, and 1 control compound against three forms of PIP4K2 and characterizes full-length and truncated form of KDM5B. Upon completion of these services, the contractor shall profile 5 small molecules for PIP4K2 and KDM5 each using a proprietary method used previously against IDH1. The contract shall aslo provide binding constant to NCGC within 4 weeks of start of experiment. The NCATS Chemical Genomics Center NCGC is responsible for providing vendor with proteins and compounds.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance: 5 weeks after receipt of the contract award</p>

<DESC>This is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a Sources Sought Notice only.
<p>NOAA is a federal agency within the Department of Commerce that is focused on the condition of the oceans and the atmosphere. The NOAA mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our nation's economic, social and environmental needs. As a supplier of environmental information products, NOAA provides the nation with information that pertains to the state of the oceans and the atmosphere. This is clearly manifest in the production of weather warnings and forecasts through the National Weather Service, but NOAA's information products extend to climate, ecosystems and commerce as well. NOAA serves as the steward of national coastal and marine environments. In coordination with federal, state, local, tribal and international authorities, NOAA manages the use of these environments, regulating fisheries and marine sanctuaries as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species.</p>
<p>NOAA is a trusted source of accurate and objective scientific information in four particular areas of national and global importance which constitute its long-term mission critical and strategic goals:<br />&bull; Ecosystems: Ensure the sustainable use of resources and balance competing uses of coastal and marine ecosystems, recognizing both their human and natural components. <br />&bull; Climate: Understand changes in climate, including the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon, to ensure that we can plan and respond properly. <br />&bull; Weather &amp; Water: Provide data and forecasts for weather and water cycle events, including storms, droughts and floods. <br />&bull; Commerce &amp; Transportation: Provide weather, climate, and ecosystem information to make sure individual and commercial transportation is safe, efficient and environmentally sound. <br />To assist it in framing its long-term strategic course and assist in policy discussions, NOAA requires input in many complex and interrelated scientific and technical topics. This requires an understanding of the current state of science as well as an intimate knowledge of newly emerging scientific and technical methodologies to support recommendations for future directions NOAA should take into consideration while laying out its strategic plan to meet its mission goals.<br />The government needs to acquire independent scientific, technical, and policy guidance from scientists and others in a variety of environmental and public policy issues through the conduct of roundtable discussions and/or scientific studies which result in compilation of written reports <strong><em>by an institution that has been formally chartered by the U.S. Congress to provide independent scientific advice to the Congress and federal agencies. </em></strong></p>
<p>Areas to be investigated through studies, but are not limited to, the following areas of interest:<br />&bull; Integrated Observing and Data Management System<br />&bull; Assessments and Forecasts of Coastal and Marine Ecosystems<br />&bull; Scenario Development to Support Specific Management Actions and Decisions<br />&bull; Exploring Unknown and Little Known Areas of Earth's Oceans<br />&bull; Capacity Building and Effective Knowledge Transfer<br />&bull; Integrated Global Observation and Data System<br />&bull; Documenting and Understanding Changes in Climate Forcings and Feedbacks<br />&bull; Improving Climate Predictions and Projections<br />&bull; Understanding Impacts of Climate Variability and Change on Marine Ecosystems<br />&bull; Enhancing NOAA's Operational Decision Support Tools<br />&bull; Improving Weather Forecasts and Warnings<br />&bull; Water Resources Forecasting<br />&bull; Providing Information to Air Quality Decision Makers and Establishing and Improving a National Air Quality Forecast Capability<br />&bull; Improving Understanding and Forecast Capability in Coasts, Estuaries, and Oceans<br />&bull; Reduced Risks to Life, Health, and Property<br />&bull; Issues that Slow or Stop Movement of Goods<br />&bull; Reduced Risks and Adverse Environmental Impacts<br />&bull; Security</p>
<p>Due to the nature and impact of these types of studies and roundtables,<strong><em> NOAA has previously procured these services through the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">National Academy of Sciences</span> because of its unique qualifications. They have been the only source that can provide the measure of expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance necessary to meet all of NOAA's program requirements. </em></strong></p>
<p>Firms, that they have the necessary expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance necessary to meet our needs, may submit a capability statement for the government to further review. This announcement is open to both small and large businesses.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) code 541990 (size standard in gross annual receipts of income as defined in 13 CFR 121.104) ) possess the capability to support National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to provide scientific studies related to NOAA's mission. Responses to this sources sought notice shall not constitute responses to any solicitation, which is not currently available. As stipulated in FAR 5.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a small business set-aside, full and open competition, or sole-source procurement.</p>
<p>Firms may submit a capability statement or proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The capability statement shall be no more than twenty (20) single-sided pages in length and shall address the following topics:<br />&bull; Organization's Name, Address, Phone Number, Email, and Point of Contact Information<br />&bull; Brief summary describing your organization and purpose.

<DESC><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"> </span>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong>National Managed Care Contract (NMCC) for the United States Marshals Service (USMS)</strong></p>
<p>The (USMS) is preparing to re-compete its NMCC. This is a market survey/sources sought for informational purposes only, and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal. The DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) for this requirement and the associated attachments are included herein. No contract will be awarded based on this announcement; no reimbursement will be made for costs associated with responding to this announcement; and no telephone calls about this announcement will be accepted or acknowledged.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that small businesses are able to submit comprehensive capability packages. Interested small businesses that are certified and qualified as a small business concerns under NAICS code 524114 with a size standard of $38.5M are encouraged to submit their capability packages outlining their experience in providing the requested services. A draft PWS is attached.  The capability package should be thorough enough to determine whether the vendor is capable of providing the services.  USMS is seeking vendors who can provide and bid all services.</p>
<p>The USMS has the following questions concerning this requirement and would appreciate an industry response.   The questions are as follows:</p>
<p>NMCC Services<br />&bull;	Is there a database or source of information that can identify hospitals that have locked prisoner medical wards?</p>
<p>Electronic Prisoner Medical Request (ePMR) Approval Task:<br />&bull;	The prisoner medical services enumerated in Attachment B1 are  proposed for pre-approval by the contractor  using the USMS's ePMR system.  What type of employee (ie. Registered nurse, licensed professional nurse, or other) would industry propose to fulfill this function and why?</p>
<p>Claims Payment Task<br />&bull;	What process does industry recommend or have in place to ensure that the government receives the services that it paid for?  Is there an industry process for offsetting prisoner medical payments to a provider made by a contractor acting on behalf of the USMS in cases where a provider was improperly paid or paid an amount in excess of amounts owed?<br />&bull;	What evidence should the Government require to ensure the contractor has an adequate line of credit as required in the PWS?</p>
<p>Pricing/CLIN Structure<br />What type of CLIN structure does industry recommend given the following structure? The USMS proposes to reimburse the Contractor for processing and repricing claims on a per claim basis.  The Contractor would be re-imbursed for each valid claim, exception claim, duplicate claim, adjustment claim and rejected claim that it processes.  The Government will not reimburse the contractor for processing revision claims.  Duplicate claims and rejected claims do not require any re-pricing.  The Contractor should consider that exception claims require a lower level of processing and no re-pricing (see Attachment C). During the formal source selection phase it is anticipated that the Contractor will propose one fixed price per claim processed.  The price will be the same for every type of claim processed whether the claim is re-priced or not.  The Government estimates that the contractor will be required to process approximately the following number of claims on an annual basis (based on FY 2014 and 2015):</p>
<p>2015/2014<br />&bull;	Valid Claims&nbsp; - 		68,393/71,888<br />&bull;	Exception Claims -&nbsp;	2,200/2,200<br />&bull;	Duplicate Claims&nbsp;- &nbsp; 	1,634/1,442<br />&bull;	Adjusted Claims -	1,454/2,254<br />&bull;	Rejected Claims&nbsp;- 519/1,416</p>
<p>&bull;	The Government seeks industry input on this re-imbursement proposal.  Is there a more optimal way to compensate contractors for processing and re-pricing prisoner medical claims, and if so why?</p>
<p>&bull;	The Government seeks industry input on the best way for the Government to reimburse the Contractor for making payments to medical providers on behalf of the Government after claims have been processed and re-priced.  The Contractor will be required to bundle claims from the same provider together and make one payment to the provider wherever possible avoiding duplicate payments solely for the purpose of reimbursement.  In 2015, the incumbent Contractor made 17,217 payments to medical providers on behalf of the Government.</p>
<p>&bull;	What is the industry standard for terms of payment of invoices to the contractor and frequency of billings for the types of services outlined in this Request for Information?</p>
<p>Transition In/Out<br />&bull;	Does industry have any recommendations concerning the approach and time frames needed to ensure a smooth transition from one contractor to another when a follow-on award is made?</p>
<p>General<br />&bull;	Does the contractor have a GSA Schedule for satisfying the requirements of the PWS?<br />&bull;	Are there any requirements in the PWS that are contrary to best practices for this type of service?<br />&bull;	What is the recommended period of performance for this requirement?  A ten year contract has been proposed.  Is there a contract term that would provide more favorable pricing to the Government?  How should the base and option years of this contract be structured?  The incumbent contract incorporated a four year base period with two three year options.  What suggestions does industry have concerning the contract term? What are the best evaluation criteria for ensuring awardee is capable of performing all elements?<br />&bull;	What USMS historical data would be beneficial to the offerors?<br />&bull;	What incentives/disincentives would be motivational for Contractor performance?</p>
<p>If at least two responsible small business concerns are determined by the Government to be capable of performing this requirement based on an evaluation of the capability packages submitted by 2:00 pm EST, December 8, 2015, the requirement will be solicited as a 100% set-aside for small business concerns. If capability packages are not received from at least two responsible small business concerns by the response date, or if the Government determines that no small businesses are capable of performing this requirement based upon an evaluation of the capability packages submitted, this requirement will be solicited under full and open procedures.</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;Responses are due no later than 11:00 a.m. eastern standard time&nbsp;December 1, 2015. This is a Sources Sought Notice and is for informational/ market research purposes only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS OR BIDS. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, requests capability statements from (8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owner Businesses (SDVOB) and HUBZone small businesses concerning the potential project described below. Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.</p>
<p>Responses are to be sent via email to Lillian.lamb@usace.army.mil or hard copy to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 10 S. Howard Street, Room 7200-D, Baltimore MD 21201-1715 no later than 11:00 a.m. eastern standard time December 1, 2015. <br /><br />Project Description: Georgetown Reservoir Basin Cleaning Services, Washington, DC.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be for a service contract and it will be advertized as a Request for Quote (RFQ) in the $100,000 - $250,000 range. The work involves the removal of water treatment residuals (i.e. sediment) from two large basins by a submersible, electrically powered, remotely operated robotic equipment that conveys the collected residuals to the wet well of an adjacent Pumping Station. The Pumping Station is located on-site at the Georgetown Reservoir at 4600 MacArthur Boulevard, NW, Washington, DC 20007.</p>
<p>The Washington Aqueduct provides potable water to approximately one million people in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia. As part of the water treatment and supply system, the Washington Aqueduct maintains the Georgetown Reservoir which consists of three basins. The basins are an important component of the water treatment system operated by the Washington Aqueduct. These basins are used to settle out water treatment residuals from water that is filtered at the McMillan Water Treatment Plant. Washington Aqueduct currently operates dredges in two of the basins, but due to the irregular shape of the basins, there are areas of the basins that cannot be reached by the dredges. Hence, the government is seeking an experienced contractor with the resources and expertise to perform the work of this project under the following constraints:<br />i. Ensuring non-contamination while working at an industrial facility around a portable water supply system.<br />ii. The equipment used must have natural gas or propane powered engines or be electrically operated. The Washington Aqueduct processes potable water, so no gasoline powered equipment is allowed to be used in the reservoir basins. <br />iii. Performing sediment removal activities throughout the year round while maintaining access to other contractors and government employees working in the area <br />iv. The proposed equipment must be able to remove sediment at water depths of up to 29 feet and pump the sediment for distances up to 2000 feet.</p>
<p>Interested 8(a), SDVOB and HUBZone certified firms should submit a concise narrative and specific project examples of similar size and scope that demonstrate their experience in:</p>
<p>1. The successful removal of deposited sediments from large basins at an industrial facility within limited time durations.<br />2. The ability to remove sediment from basins while keeping turbidity levels resulting from the operation to a minimum. <br />3. The use of submersible, electrically powered, remotely operated robotic equipment to clean basins.<br />4. Quantifying and measuring the amount of sediment removed on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Capability statements should include the following information:</p>

            Software Quality Integration Results and Evaluation (SQUIRE) Services

The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to search for qualified vendors capable of meeting the requirements to provide benefits and services to Veterans of the United States by implementing SQUIRE.
This is a request for information (RFI) only and shall not be considered an Invitation for Bids, Request for Quotations, or a Request for Proposals.  This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  It is based upon the best information available and is subject to future modification.  This request does not commit the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  VA is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that VA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responder's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  Responders are fully responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted, or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  

The requirement is to provide benefits and services to Veterans of the United States.  In meeting these goals, OI&T strives to provide high quality, effective, and efficient information technology (IT) services to those responsible for providing care to the Veterans at the point-of-care as well as throughout all the points of the Veterans' health care in an effective, timely, and compassionate manner.  VA depends on information management/information technology (IM/IT) systems to meet mission goals.
VA operates numerous IT application software systems that enable the delivery of services to Veterans. VA requires the capability to evaluate the quality of the code and the corresponding documentation developed by contractors that support the underlying operation of the systems.

In order to evaluate the quality of software code developed for VA systems, OI&T has a requirement to standardize the evaluation of software code. The process to standardize the evaluation is called "Software Quality Integration Results and Evaluation (SQUIRE)".  Based on industry best practices and standards, SQUIRE will use proven techniques and tools to provide VA with a consistent and repeatable process for evaluating software code quality through non-functional testing of the operational code. 
In order to improve the evaluation of the quality of software code in VA systems, VA is planning to acquire the services of a contractor to implement SQUIRE.  After contract award, OI&T PD will provide the hosting environment, software tools for use in the hosting environment, Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and Standard Operating Procedures required to conduct SQUIRE analysis.
This acquisition is for professional services to use the SQUIRE processes and tools to evaluate the quality of the software code being delivered to VA. The Contractor will take input from multiple VA projects and in various formats. The input includes documentation and source code. The output will include an executive summary, final report, and briefing. The output will help development projects improve software code quality. In addition, aggregated findings from evaluations of individual projects shall be developed into trend analysis and management reports to help improve services to Veterans.  
Furthermore, at the end of this contract, OI&T PD requires transitional support to ensure SQUIRE capabilities will be transitioned to VA or successor contractor personnel as they are on-boarded to manage and further the SQUIRE initiative. Every product that is produced in this effort will be owned by VA.
The attached is the DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) Attachment 1, dated October 23, 2015, further defines the requirements.  Also attached is Concept of Operations Attachment 2, dated October 2015, which provides an overview of how the SQUIRE process will work in VA.
Additionally, the Contractors are required to answer the questions to the Attachment 3by 11/30/2015. This document should be included with the submission of your Capabilities Statement.
If interested, please submit your answers to the RFI and a Capabilities Statement, limited to 15 pages (8.5" x 11", using not smaller than 12 point font) in length, for your company, your teammates and/or subcontractors as well as company experience in meeting PWS requirements.
Contractors may submit questions through FBO concerning this RFI. All contractor questions must be submitted by November 30, 2015. 
Responding companies shall also provide the following information with their response:
- Company Name
- CAGE/DUNS Number under which the company is registered in VetBiz.gov
- Company Address
- Point of contact name
- Telephone number
- Email address
- Company's business size for NAICS 541519
Responses are requested no later than 4:00PM EST, December 11, 2015 via e-mail to Alma.Aliaj@va.gov and Jan.Oberdick@va.gov.
Please also indicate if you, your teammates, and/or subcontractors are a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business or a Veteran Owned Small Business.  Please note VA118-16-N-0890 in the subject line of your response.  In addition, indicate any and all contracts your company may have related to this type requirement.  VA reserves the right to not respond to any or all emails or materials submitted.  All current VA requirements identified herein are subject.

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out&shy; process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />&bull; Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>* Consult with your Command Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager for local policy when IT-III (non-sensitive) access is required for non-US citizens outside the United States.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<SUBJECT>Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) accreditation services
<SOLNBR>HT0011-NOI-16-0001
<RESPDATE>112315
<CONTACT>Jake Lewis, Contracting Officer , Phone 7036814614, Email jake.lewis@tma.osd.mil
<DESC>The Defense Health Agency intends to issue a sole source contract to the National Clinical Quality Association (NCQA) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (iii) for the continued delivery of Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) accreditation services. The period of performance for this sole source contract will be 12 months (November through October 2016) - encompassing a 6-month base period and a 6-month option to extend services under FAR 52.217-8. This action is necessary to bridge the performance period between MHS and NCQA contract until such time that a follow-on contract can be competitively awarded. Due to the recent and&nbsp;unexpected termination of contract award HT0011-15-C-0017, a bridge contract is needed to allow for the continuation of services, while the solicitation for a new contract that more adequately reflects the governments needs is developed, reviewed, approved, negotiated and awarded. It is anticipated that the bridge award will be a Firm Fixed Price contract.<br /><br />The Military Health System (MHS) began transitioning its more than 440 primary care clinics to the PCMH model of care in 2010. During this transition, the Services and DHA have contracted with NCQA to assist Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in becoming recognized (or accredited) against standards established by a civilian entity in order to distinguish its PCMHs and to increase standardization and the degree of "patient-centeredness" in clinical and business processes. The DHA contract with NCQA ended on 30 September 2015,&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;the award of the aforementioned contract #HT0011-15-C-0017. <br /><br />The MHS currently has over 95 accreditation surveys in process - surveys that were started by NCQA. Therefore NCQA is the only contractor that can immediately step in to meet the MHS' PCMH accreditation needs, particularly given the potentially short period of performance. Any other vendor would require ramp up/transition time and would need to train MTF personnel on its particular survey practices and procedures - all of which would duplicate costs already sunk by the Services in preparing for the NCQA surveys. In addition, NCQA has the experienced and skilled personnel already in place to provide continued and uninterrupted services within the MHS. Failure to sustain support continuity will result in compromised ability by MHS to meet it current operating capabilities. <br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. All capability statements received within fifteen (10) calendar days after date of publication of this notice will be reviewed by the Government and considered. Statements must be received NLT November 23, 2015 3pm EST. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Should your firm desire to submit a capability statement, it should demonstrate the Offeror's experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government. The statement shall include business size; ability to self-perform work; ability to quickly implement processes necessary to carry out the accreditation process, layers of subcontracting; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements. Statements should not exceed 5 pages in length. Written inquiries may be directed to Jake Lewis via email at jake.lewis@dha.mil. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.<br />

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate with the State of Maryland/University of Maryland (UMD) supplemental funding in support of Contract No. HHSN271201400045C to ensure the Brain and Tissue Bank can continue to respond to the large number of tissue requests made through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Neurobiobank. The UMD continues to collect and distribute brain tissue as one of the sites of the broader NIH Neurobiobank but they have seen a marked increase in the number of requests since becoming part of the Neurobiobank and the current staffing levels are unable to maintain the desired efficiency. The acquisition purpose is to supplement UMD's budget to hire an additional full time employee in support of the brain and tissue repository to help alleviate this burden. The additional staff member will help ensure continued success of the bank in fulfilling the large number of requests received by the NIH Neurobiobank. There will be further extensive and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement due to high demands of the NIH Neurobiobank, making competition unfeasible to provide supplemental funding, in a timely manner, under the contract. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541711 and the Product Service Code (PSC) is AN11. The NIMH intends to issue a supplemental modification to the aforementioned contract, fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this notice, pursuant to Authority 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, The Council of State Governments, 2760 Research Park Drive, Lexington, KY 40511, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Various Districts, has a requirement for EMAP assessment and accreditation manager training, program organization under the EMAP standards, program mentoring, assessment of district- and division-provided documentation to meet individual EMAP standards, and capability assessments. Results of these assessments will be provided for review and solicitation for accreditation of individual district and division emergency management programs. USACE sites which are already accredited will also need to accomplish the requirement for re-accreditation. EMAP is the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) certified entity for creating emergency management standards. These standards were developed initially from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) who also developed the Incident Command Structure (ICS) which has been adopted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), USACE, and the Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) as the emergency response organization structure for incident command. The EMAP program is a nonprofit organization established in part by FEMA to improve the minimum baseline standards that should exist within any emergency management program. EMAP is the only national emergency management accreditation agency or program able to meet the above capabilities.
<p><br />It is anticipated that a Fixed Price contract will be awarded. The NAICS code is 813920, and size standard is $15.0 million.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement; however, this notice is not a request for competitive proposals. All capability statements received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this notice will be reviewed by the Government and considered. The notice publication date is 17 November 2015, and the deadline date is 2 December 2015. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All questions should be sent via email to Sophia Chin at sophia.m.chin@usace.army.mil.</p>

The Contractor shall-<br />(1) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (m), in all subcontracts, including subcontracts for commercial items; and<br />(2) Require subcontractors to rapidly report cyber incidents directly to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil and the prime Contractor.

<CONTACT>Jaron C. McGee, Phone 4072808566, Email jaron.c.mcgee.ctr@mail.mil
<DESC><p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>1.0 TITLE. <br />Development of a predictive algorithm framework for sleep staging and apnea</p>
<p>2.0 GENERAL. <br />Sleep loss and circadian disruption can negatively impact warfighter health and performance and thus affect military operational readiness. The Naval Health Research Center Sleep and Fatigue Research Laboratory (NHRC-SFRL) seeks to develop validated, scientifically sound screening tools for sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, that may be deployed in an outpatient setting with active duty service members. These tools would provide vital diagnostic information from the patients' real world setting, which may enhance clinical decision process and assist with customization of treatment plans. The NHRC-SFRL has a need for the development of algorithms related to sleep-related outcomes of interest to the NHRC-SFRL.The long term goal of NHRC-SFRL research is to guide design and implementation of a novel remote performance monitoring system from which to collect data for the analysis and prediction of sleep and performance-related outcomes for translation to multiple operational and clinical settings.</p>
<p>3.0 OBJECTIVE. <br />Objectives for this particular research effort are as follows:</p>
<p>3.1 Leverage traditional sleep and behavioral metrics to collect information pertaining to operator state, such as subjective indicators of sleep experience &amp; quality.<br />3.2 Develop and validate a user-centered, secure web-based data monitoring and visualization portal, which may be leveraged for research and training in the operational and clinical space.<br />3.3 Collect metrics of multi-sensor sleep, physiological, and psychological performance by down-selecting and integrating highly accurate, commercially available sensors into a portable device. The integrated system will be capable of providing raw sensor data to iteratively inform the predictive model.<br />3.4 Iteratively develop and validate a predictive model through ongoing cycles of data collection events and generic algorithm driven analysis. The resulting predictive model will be designed with the intent of translation to multiple operational and clinical use cases.</p>
<p>4.0 REQUIREMENT. <br />Total Budget: $60,000<br />Specific tasks, staff, travel, and other requirements are described below.</p>
<p>4.1 TASKS.<br />In support of this effort, the contractor shall:<br />4.1.1 Assist the host data collection site (NHRC-SFRL) with protocol development and methodological planning. Protocol development by the contractor will consist of data analysis study planning, protocol writing, and protocol submission performed in collaboration with NHRC-SFRL. Project initiation will require acceptance of a research protocol between NHRC and the contractor's Institutional Review Boards (IRB). This task will also include coordination of receiving required data, any necessary research equipment, and necessary training on operation of such equipment, from NHRC in order to execute the approved protocol.<br />Deliverable: Joint IRB approved research protocol. <br />Est. 1 month duration.<br />4.1.2 After receiving existing data sets from NHRC-SFRL, the contractor will perform data analysis, interpretation and algorithm development of these data. Using a time-series approach, data analytics will combine critical data elements from baseline periods, with those collected at various periods throughout and at the completion of data collection evolutions, accounting for individual differences and allowing creation of individual performance profiles. Data inputs related to physiology, subjective fatigue, and other behavioral measurements will be compiled to create a baseline predictive model of target outcomes such as sleep staging and sleep apnea. The model will improve in accuracy and expand its applications with a completed data set from NHRC-SFRL and future data sets. The initial baseline model will drive the continued development and deployment of specific methodologies to support new data collection and sensor testing, which in turn, will be used to iteratively refine the algorithms.<br />Deliverables: (1) Identification of specific and generalizable factors pertaining to sleep quality; (2) A predictive model utilizing measurements of these factors to predict future behavior. <br />Est. 9 month duration.<br />4.1.3 The contractor will perform project management activities including general discussions and management associated with executing the proposed project with the contractor's leadership and project team members, management and research planning activities performed in conjunction with NHRC-SFRL investigators, project product reviews as required, as well as data analysis and associated coordination of tasks with NHRC-SFRL. Final project closeout activities that can be accomplished prior to expiration of project funds will also be included under this task.<br />Est. 9 month duration.<br />4.2 STAFF.<br />The following staff is required and total estimated cost provided below:</p>
<p>Position/Labor Category FTEs/Hours*<br />Research Physiologist 1 (1,920)<br />TOTAL $</p>
<p>4.3 TRAVEL.<br />Travel between NHRC-SFRL and the contractor's facility is anticipated in support of this delivery order. Cost is estimated to be $ based on the following:<br /># trips, # people, # days to San Diego, CA. <br /># trips, # people, # days to TBD.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

Invoicing will be based on actual hours worked in the invoicing period. The contractor will invoice in WAWF on a monthly basis following award. The Government does not define the contractors pay schedule (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly), but does define that it be timely and consistent throughout the lifecycle of the contract.</p>

<p>&bull;	Designing an appropriate sample; <br />&bull;	Translating, back-translating, formatting, and printing the questionnaire submitted by the Office of Opinion Research;<br />&bull;	Conducting a pretest;<br />&bull;	Managing fieldwork;<br />&bull;	Coding questionnaires, entering data, checking and cleaning the data; and <br />&bull;	Providing required deliverables: detailed sampling design, translation and back-translation of questionnaire, pretest report, final field version of questionnaire and show cards, marginal frequencies, data in ASCII and SPSS formats, codebook, methodological report, contact sheets for selected interviewers, copies of 10 completed field questionnaires, and additional supporting documentation as necessary.</p>
<p>These responsibilities are described in detail below.</p>
<p>SAMPLE DESIGN: Design and implement a probability sample design for face-to-face interviews in respondents' homes to achieve a nationally representative sample of at least 2000 adults age 18 and older.</p>
<p>Before the beginning of fieldwork the Contractor shall submit a spreadsheet or SPSS file showing all of the primary sampling units (PSUs) for each stratum, together with a description of how each unit was selected.  The Contractor shall indicate the skip intervals and random starting points used in the selection process, as well as the order in which the primary sampling units were selected within each stratum.</p>
<p>QUESTIONNAIRE:  OPN will provide an English-language questionnaire that will include approximately 40 substantive questions (35 closed-ended, 5 open-ended), focusing on public attitudes toward domestic economic and social issues, as well as international affairs.</p>
<p>In addition, for each respondent the questionnaire and final data set will include:</p>
<p>Demographics: including but not limited to gender, exact age, education, occupation, household income, number of adults in household who are eligible for the survey, economic class, city, region, urban/rural, political party support, religion and ethnicity</p>
<p>Interviewing information: <br />&bull;	date of interview (month, day, day of week);<br />&bull;	interview start time, interview end time, duration of interview in minutes;<br />&bull;	variables used to stratify the sample; a unique code for each primary sampling unit, 	secondary sampling unit, and ultimate sampling point; and a variable indicating the order 	in which the PSUs were selected within each stratum if systematic sampling is used;<br />&bull;	interviewer ID, supervisor ID, field manager ID, data entry/keypuncher ID;<br />&bull;	interviewers' indication of the privacy of the interview and the comfort, comprehension and candor of the respondent;<br />&bull;	whether the respondent is the originally selected respondent or a substitute, the number of visits/call-backs necessary to achieve a successful interview, whether the interview was back-checked, and the method of back-checking (supervisor's presence during the original interview, separate face-to-face interview by either the supervisor or another interviewer, telephone call,  and/or a letter or postcard).</p>
<p>TRANSLATION AND BACK-TRANSLATION OF QUESTIONNAIRE:  The Contractor is responsible for translating the questionnaire into colloquial Arabic, and for back-translating the translated questionnaire(s) into English.  The back-translation(s) must be done by someone who has not seen the original English questionnaire.</p>
<p>The Client will review the translation and consult with the Contractor on necessary changes.  The Client must approve the final translation before the pretest.</p>
<p>PRE-TEST:  After the Client approves the translation, the Contractor will pretest the full questionnaire with at least 25 randomly-selected representative interviews that will not be included in the final sample.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide the Client with a pretest report, including a demographic summary of the participants and a discussion by question of any problems or suggested changes to the questionnaire. The Client must approve any changes to the questionnaire.</p>
<p>FIELDWORK: Fieldwork will be done by face-to-face interviews in respondents' homes.  All interviews shall be conducted in strict adherence to the sampling plan.  The Contractor is responsible for organizing and overseeing all aspects of fieldwork, including: preparing and printing the final questionnaires; selecting and training interviewers; assigning contact lists to interviewers; supervising interviewers; enforcing quality controls; monitoring and recording contact and non-response rates; and providing weekly feedback to the Office of Opinion Research on the status of fieldwork.</p>
<p>If, in the course of fieldwork, it is apparent that there is an unusually large proportion of persons refusing to be interviewed, the Contractor must inform the Client.</p>
<p>Contact with every sampled household or adult should be attempted at least 3 times during fieldwork. The contact attempts should be spread over different times of the day and days of the week and weekend.</p>
<p>Note: the minimum achieved sample for the survey is 2000 fully completed interviews.</p>
<p>DATA MANAGEMENT:  The Contractor is responsible for processing, cleaning, and coding the data in English, enforcing quality controls for data entry, and detecting data fabrication, if any.</p>
<p>Closed-end or pre-coded questions:  The Contractor shall use the codes specified on the final questionnaire for all items.</p>
<p>Open-end questions:  The Contractor will develop categories of responses based on 200 randomly selected questionnaires from all regions of the sample, providing at least 5 sample responses for each proposed category.   Categories must be approved by the Client prior to coding responses.</p>
<p>The "Other" category should not include more than 10% of the total responses for any question.  If any single response in the "Other" category amounts to more than 2%, then the Contractor will code this response as a separate response, not as "Other."</p>
<p><br />&emsp;<br />DELIVERABLES: The Contractor shall deliver the following to OPN by email (except as otherwise noted):</p>
<p>1)	Detailed sampling design;</p>
<p>2)	Translation and back-translation of the questionnaire;</p>
<p>3)	Pretest report;</p>
<p>4)	Field version(s) of the questionnaire and all show cards;</p>
<p>5)	Marginal frequencies (weighted, if appropriate) for all questions, including demographics;</p>
<p>6)	The final, cleaned data files including all survey questions, demographics, interviewing information and (if applicable) weight values; these files shall be in two formats:</p>
<p>a.	ASCII, with all records having the same length<br />b.	SPSS Windows format (*.sav), with all variables and values labeled in English;</p>
<p>7)	A complete codebook for all survey questions, demographics, interviewing information, and (if applicable) weight values, identifying the column positions of all variables in the ASCII file;</p>
<p>8)	A detailed methodological report which contains sufficient details on the sampling design and weighting so that independent researchers would be able to replicate the survey using only information in the report.  In particular, the methodological report  shall include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	A brief report of any unusual problems or significant events which may have influenced the conduct of the survey or the responses given;<br />&bull;	A description of field interviewing, including: exact dates of field work; interviewer selection, training and supervision; and enforcement of quality controls;<br />&bull;	A description of the sampling design and procedure, including:</p>
<p>o	The universe sampled;<br />o	The populations excluded from the sample and why these were excluded;<br />o	Description of statistical documentation used to design the sample (e.g., census data) and date of the information;<br />o	All forms of stratification used, and the basis for stratification; If you use differential probabilities of selection in sampling (e.g., stratification with different rates by strata), provide the justification for using those rates and describe the expected effects on the variances.<br />o	Selection procedure at each stage of sampling: primary sampling unit (PSU), secondary sampling unit (SSU), sampling point, household and individual respondent;<br />o	For PSUs and SSUs, indicate the order in which each unit was selected.  For systematic sampling, indicate the random starting point and the skip interval;</p>
<p>&bull;	If you weight the data, provide a detailed description of weighting procedures.  The Client must be able to recreate weight values based on this documentation, the data sources, and the data file.  Any weights should account for:</p>
<p>o	The probability of selection of the household and the adult (the base weights should be the inverse of the probability of selection);<br />o	Nonresponse and noncoverage; <br />o	Adjustments to match population data (describe sources of population data).</p>
<p>&bull;	Report on sampling performance, including:</p>
<p>o	Information on sampling point substitution, including: a list of sampling points that were replaced, the reason for their replacement, the procedures for replacement, and the replacement sampling points;<br />o	Rate of respondent substitution and procedures for substituting respondents;<br />o	The number of completed interviews, partial interviews, refusals, failed contacts (e.g. no one at home), cases that are not eligible (e.g. not a housing unit, no adults in the household), and cases of unknown eligibility (e.g. unable to locate address), and the resulting response rate ("RR1" as defined in "Standard Definitions" by the American Association for Public Opinion Research);<br />o	The response rate (as defined above) for each city/province/region/interviewer;<br />o	An estimate of sampling error that takes into account the actual sampling procedures used (stratification, clustering, etc.).  Include a brief explanation of how interviewing and fieldwork procedures affected the theoretical margin of error.</p>
<p>9)	Selected contact sheets for 10 specific interviewers which the Client will specify after receipt of the final data set.  These may be sent either in hard copy or as a scanned email attachment;</p>
<p>10)	Ten completed questionnaires which the Client will specify after receipt of the final data set (either in hard copy or as a scanned email attachment);</p>
<p>11)	The Client may request additional supporting documentation to fully understand the design and conduct of the survey (e.g., interviewer maps).</p>
<p>TIME SCHEDULE:  Each stage of the survey project should be conducted according to a schedule agreed to by the Contractor and the Office of Opinion Research.</p>
<p>CONFIDENTIALITY: The study is to be conducted in the name of the Contractor, in keeping with standard industry practice. The Client's identity shall not be revealed to field supervisors, interviewers or respondents in order to minimize bias.  Further, the Client's identity, details of the project and the survey results shall not be revealed to outside parties - e.g., media, academic or government - at any point before, during or after completion of the project without the express written permission of the Client.<br /> <br />ARCHIVING OF STUDY: The Client may store parts of the study (questionnaires, data set, methodological summary) with a non-profit archive (e.g., the Roper Center, the National Archive and Records Administration).  Projects will be embargoed for at least two years, and all identifiable markers of the Contractor will be removed.</p>
<p>BILLING AND PAYMENT:  Payment is typically authorized either in a single installment upon receipt and approval of all required deliverables, OR in two installments - the first upon approval of the final questionnaire and sampling plan, and the second upon receipt and approval of all required deliverables.  Please note, payment cannot be authorized upon commissioning the survey.  All payments will be made in U.S. dollars.  The method of payment is typically by electronic funds transfer if the Contractor provides appropriate banking information, but may also be made by U.S. Treasury check.<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________&nbsp;<br /><br />The following solicitation provisions apply to this acquisition:</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, has a requirement to purchase a mobile eye tracking system. Procurement of this system will support the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) in their mission to reduce and prevent rail accidents.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. DTRT5716Q80039 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-83, effective November 01, 2015. The NAICS Code is 333314; the Small Business size standard is 500 Employees. This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK - Begin <br /><br />Introduction/Background<br />The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT), Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, issues this Statement of Work (SOW) in support of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) in their mission to reduce and prevent rail accidents. The purpose of this request is for the Volpe Center to acquire an eye tracking system to collect driver gaze information while operating a simulated locomotive. This system will include recordings of eye movements, driver scan and search patterns in a three-dimensional space in which the driver's head may rotate. The system will be primarily used in the FRA's Cab Technology Integration Laboratory (CTIL) rail simulator, but may be used in the field during future experiments.<br /><br />Scope of Work<br /><br />The central deliverable to the government is the supply and installation of a tool which tracks subject gaze locations in a 3d, multi-surface environment and the requisite tools for analysing its data and isolating it based on specific areas of interest. The Government also requires that the hardware allows for extensive subject mobility. The reasoning for this is twofold. Firstly, the simulator in which it will be installed is reconfigurable, and it is essential that the eye tracker can function without repositioning of equipment. Secondly, subjects are likely to be wearing any eye tracker headgear for periods of over an hour, and this is why the Government needs an untethered light system.<br /><br />Period of Performance<br /><br />The Contractor shall deliver and configure all components and provide any necessary training within sixty (60) days from the date of the award.<br />Place of Performance<br />The Contractor shall provide on-site installation, demonstration and any training at the Volpe Center in Cambridge, MA, in the FRA's Cab Technology Integration Laboratory (CTIL). <br /><br />Requirements<br /><br />In meeting the Volpe Center's minimum requirements, the system shall:<br />1. Have head mounted optics which are lightweight (less than seventy grams).<br />2. Maintain accuracy while the subject is wearing corrective lenses, including bifocals and progressive bifocals.<br />3. Work with a wide array of eyeglass frame designs, or provide vision correction so that subjects' glasses could potentially be removed while wearing the device.<br />4. Function in both light and dark-light conditions.<br />5. Function for more than four hours, if the device requires batteries.<br />6. Include a second battery, if the device requires the use of a battery.<br />7. Integrate into a Government-procured rail simulator and be transferable to other simulators or field vehicles.<br />8. Function "untethered." That is, provide for free motion of subject's head, and extensive subject mobility without being directly attached to a laptop or larger device.<br />9. Resolve and record position of handheld devices or clipboard.<br />10. Have a short setup/calibration time (&lt;2 minutes) and calibrate using five or fewer calibration points.<br />11. Receive a TTL signal from an external source and either include a column in the output showing the signal state, or use the signal as a marker in the data file. This signal will be used to align the eye tracker's data with other data sources from the simulator.<br />12. Be capable of subject data recalibration after collection, and use the new calibration for analysis.<br />13. Allow for repair without replacing the entire unit.<br />14. Have analysis tools which reduce the raw eye tracking data to fixations.<br />15. Have analysis tools which automate gaze data analysis to avoid relying on frame-by-frame analysis.<br />16. Have analysis tools which automatically identify eye fixation locations based on researcher-defined areas of interest.<br />17. Be capable of producing accurate data without a separate head-tracking system.<br />18. Function in an environment that is comprised mostly of aluminium and steel.<br />19. Be configured by the contractor to operate with remote oversight in a room adjacent to where the subject is wearing the equipment (the Government will provide a computer for this function).<br />20. Be supported by the contractor for a period of at least a year.<br />21. Have components that maintain a temperature below 105 degrees if they come into contact with the subject's face or head.<br /><br />Acceptance Criteria<br /><br />The Government will consider the Contractors work complete when the system has been installed onsite, configured to work properly, and the system has been demonstrated to two Volpe Center employees (both to learn how to operate the system and to ensure that it meets the Requirements). Demonstration will include calibration in light and dark environments (as well as with various types of glasses), data recording while subject's head is moving, any requisite gaze mapping, data reduction and simulator timing.</p>

<p>(a) The Government intends to award based on the best value, trade-off process IAW FAR 13.106. The Government may, if necessary, conduct discussions with all responsible Offerors within the competitive range if established. Award will be made to the best Offeror whose quote conforms to the terms and conditions of the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government. Therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest price or the highest technically rated offer.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation Methodology. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE AND TRADE-OFFS. The Government will base the determination of best value on a comparative assessment of the Offerors' technical approach, past performance, delivery, price and the other evaluation factors identified elsewhere in the solicitation. The determination of best value also considers the relative importance of the evaluation factors. All non-price evaluation factors, when combined are:</p>
<p>[X] significantly more important than price. As other evaluation factors become more equal, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Approach: The Offeror will provide a detailed technical package which describes the processes, equipment, facility, engineering capabilities, environmental controls, and experience levels of personnel, related to the levels of repair IAW the Statement of Work (SOW). The package shall describe processes that demonstrate technical capability to repair carbon fiber, fiberglass, aramid and kevlar, of monolithic and sandwich structural design. Composite panels, excluding carbon fiber, may have aluminum wire or screen imbedded into the surface of the panel to aide in electrical and static protection or has an anti-static paint applied. Dimple washers may be installed to protect sandwich panels from crushing loads when fasteners are tightened during panel installation in other structures, as well as, providing a means for electrical bonding. The package shall be prepared in an orderly format and in sufficient detail to enable the Government to make a thorough evaluation of the Contractor's technical competence and ability to comply with the solicitation requirements specified in the SOW. It must be clear, concise and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and substantiation of claim validity. Legibility, clarity and coherence are very important. The package should not simply re-state or re-phrase the Government's requirements, rather provide convincing rationale how the Offeror intends to meet the Government's requirements. Offerors shall assume the Government has no prior knowledge of their facilities and experience, and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the Offeror's quote. Pricing must not be included in the technical package. Offeror in submitting its quote shall further:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide uncontrolled approved copy of the company's quality manual. Review will be based on the requirements set forth by the FAA part 145 advisory circular AC 145-9. <br />&bull; Provide a copy of the title 14CFR Part 145 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifications which includes the Air Agency Certificate and Operations Specifications. <br />&bull; Provide documentation concerning FAA Designated Engineering Representative (DER) experience and capability to engineer repair procedures for composite components.</p>
<p>Technical approach will be rated in accordance with the adjectival categories in Table 1 below.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance: In conducting past performance evaluations, the Government reserves the right to use both the information provided by the Offeror and information obtained from other sources. Offeror shall provide in its quote a minimum of two past performance references with contact information (within the last three years) demonstrating performance of work similar in type and scope to that described in the SOW. Offeror is requested to forward the Past Performance Questionnaire found in Attachment C attached hereto to these references for prompt completion and request the responses be submitted electronically directly to the Contract Specialist of this solicitation no later than December 17, 2015 at 4:00 pm EST. Past performance questionnaires submitted by the Offeror will not be accepted. The Government reserves the right to verify past performance information and obtain past performance information using tools such as the Government's Past Performance Information Systems. If Offeror has no past performance history, Offeror must affirmatively so state. When past performance is not available, the Offeror will be evaluated as neutral.</p>
<p>The Offeror shall include documentation regarding their past performance as it directly relates to the work being procured under this solicitation. To illustrate Offeror's past performance, the following documentation shall be submitted: Offeror shall provide documentation outlining the Offeror's past performance with contracts, as a prime or major subcontractor, which is the same or similar in nature, size, complexity to the services being procured under this RFQ. The submittal shall include rationale how it was determined that the work performed previously was the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the work specified in the RFQ. Non-government contracts may be used if Government contracts are not available. Offerors electing to submit this data must furnish at least the following information: Name and address of the contracting entity; the contract number; award and completion dates; the dollar value; the contract type; the phone number, and any problems encountered and the corrective action taken by the Offeror. The documentation shall be submitted in the following format:</p>
<p>o Contract Number, Award Date and Contract Type.</p>
<p>o Price - Original Award and Final (or projected final, if contract is current).<br /><br />o Offerors are reminded that both independent data and data provided by offerors may be used by the Government to evaluate Offeror past performance. However, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance as requested remains with the Offerors. Quotes that do not contain requested information risk being rejected or receiving a lesser rating by the Government. In the case of an Offeror without any relevant past performance, past performance will be rated as neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>o The Government will evaluate Offeror's Past Performance and assess relative risks associated with its likelihood of success in performing the requirements of this RFQ. Performance risk is assessed after evaluating aspects of the Offeror's recent past performance and focusing on performance relevant to the services procured hereunder. Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the Offeror's quote, data obtained from other sources, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), similar systems, interviews with technical managers, contracting officers, commercial sources and other sources known to the Government. Areas of evaluation shall include:<br />&bull; Business Relations<br />&bull; Quality of Service<br />&bull; Schedule<br />&bull; Customer Satisfaction</p>
<p>Past Performance will be rated in accordance with the adjectival categories in Table 2 below.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Delivery: The Coast Guard requires a maximum turn-around time of 30 days after receipt of components, for repair of HC-144 composite panels. Historical requirements to date show that quantities of panels issued for repair have ranged from 50 to 75 panels per delivery order. The Government will evaluate Offeror's capability to deliver quantities of panels within the required turn-around time.</p>
<p>Delivery will be rated in accordance with the adjectival categories in Table 3 below.</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Price: The Government intends to award one firm fixed-price contract. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award the contract without discussions. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.</p>
<p>Pricing should be quoted separately for all levels of repair for all CLIN(s), for the base year and option periods as specified in the schedule. The Government will evaluate pricing for all levels of repair for all years. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if repair level prices and option year prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>Table 1. Rating System for Technical Approach <br />Adjectival Rating Description</p>
<p>Superior Exceeds the RFQ requirements. The quote yields significant benefits to the Government through the demonstration of one or more strengths. Weaknesses, if any, are of small impact and NO significant weaknesses or deficiencies exist.<br />Satisfactory Meets all RFQ requirements. The quote offers no significant benefit beyond the stated requirements. NO significant weaknesses or deficiencies exist.<br />Marginal Fails to meet the minimum RFQ requirements, or has one or more significant weaknesses. Deficiencies and significant weaknesses are correctable without major quote revisions.<br />Unsatisfactory Fails to meet the minimum RFQ requirements. The quote has one or more deficiencies for which correction would require major revisions of the quote.</p>
<p>Table 2. Rating System for Past Performance<br />Adjectival Rating Description</p>
<p>Superior<br />One or more examples where past performance significantly exceeded requirements with no marginal or unsatisfactory past performance reports. <br />Satisfactory Past performance met requirements with no marginal or unsatisfactory past performance reports. <br />Marginal One or more examples where past performance failed to meet requirements due to the contractor's fault. <br />Unsatisfactory One or more examples where past performance significantly failed to meet requirements due to the contractor's fault. <br />Neutral Per FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), if an Offeror has no recent or relevant past performance information available, the Offeror &lsquo;may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance' and will be rated as Neutral.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Table 3. Rating System for Delivery <br />Adjectival Rating Description<br /><br />Superior<br />One or more examples where delivery significantly exceeded requirements with no marginal or unsatisfactory past performance reports. <br />Satisfactory Delivery met requirements with no marginal or unsatisfactory past performance reports. <br />Marginal One or more examples where delivery failed to meet requirements due to the contractor's fault. <br />Unsatisfactory One or more examples where delivery significantly failed to meet requirements due to the contractor's fault. <br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (NOV 2015) - ALT 1 (OCT 2014) <br />An Offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the Offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via http://www.acquisition.gov .

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)</p>
<p>REPAIR/MODIFICATION OF HC-144 AIRCRAFT</p>
<p>REMOVABLE COMPOSITE PANELS and STRUCTURES</p>
<p>1.0 BACKGROUND<br />1.1 The Coast Guard currently operates eighteen (18) HC-144 Maritime Patrol Aircraft. The aircraft is manufactured by AIRBUS DS MILITARY (formerly EADS CASA) in Seville, Spain. These aircraft are procured under the authority of the Coast Guard Aviation Program Management Office. While the base CASA CN-235-300M aircraft provides the foundation for the Coast Guard HC-144, changes to the base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235-300M.<br />1.2 The aircraft consists of metal and composite components and structures. Composites include carbon fiber, fiberglass, aramid and kevlar, of monolithic and sandwich structural design. Composite panels, excluding carbon fiber, may have aluminum wire or screen imbedded into the surface of the panel to aide in electrical and static protection or has an anti-static paint applied. Dimple washers may be installed to protect sandwich panels from crushing loads when fasteners are tightened during panel installation to other structures, as well as, providing a means for electrical bonding.<br />1.3 USCG aircraft are operated differently from general aviation in support of the USCG search and rescue missions, as well as surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The HC-144 missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments. These environments accelerate corrosion on airframe structures and components of the aircraft. The HC-144 and its components are inspected by USCG personnel IAW the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) periodic maintenance requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS). Inspections of the aircraft routinely show evidence of corrosion of the rivets and dimpled washers. Corrosion is caused by dissimilar material where foil or screen used as lightning and static protection come in contact with the OEM washers, poor installation of washers during panel construction, or lack of proper corrosion protection during manufacture.<br />2.0 SCOPE<br />This SOW:<br />2.1 Establishes the minimum USCG requirements necessary for repair and modification of composite components and is not intended to be all inclusive. <br />2.2 Includes the inspection, evaluation, repair, modification and return of composite components used in support of the HC-144 aircraft to service in an airworthy condition that meets the design's original strength, stiffness, shape, lightning protection, and surface finish. To have composites structural integrity restored to an airworthy condition for continued service on the aircraft. <br />2.3 Includes the services of a contractor who has reverse engineering expertise and capability to manufacturer a new composite panel including replacement metal sub-components. The new panel characteristics shall meet or exceed the structural characteristics of the original panel.<br />2.4 The Coast Guard intends to award a requirements type contract for repair and modification of HC-144 composite panels and structures, with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders. The contract will be one base year with four option periods of one year each not to exceed a total of five years.<br />2.5 This SOW seeks multiple levels of repair services (listed in section 4.0) from a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized repair center to effectively inspect, repair or modify removable HC-144 aircraft composite panels or structures to an airworthy condition for continued service on the aircraft. <br />2.6 Establish component turn time of 30 days after contractor receipt of the components. Historical requirements to date show quantities of panels issued for repair have ranged from 50 to 75 panels per delivery order. <br />3.0 REQUIREMENTS<br />The contractor shall:<br />3.1 Be a certified Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized repair center and have experience performing aircraft composite component repairs. Have all the necessary provisions to perform the contract requirements, including but not limited to, required tooling, facilities, manuals, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, personnel, documentation, preservation, and shipping of all listed components.<br />3.2 Provide copies of all Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) certifications, and any other additional certifications, such as ISO or SIX SIGMA registration. If the Contractor for any reason loses its FAA or EASA certification during the period of performance, this constitutes a material breach of contract which may, at the discretion of the Coast Guard Contracting Officer, result in contract termination. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer verbally and in writing, not later than five (5) calendar days after certification forfeiture, and disclose all facts relevant to the forfeiture.<br />3.3 Have access to all applicable documentation and manuals to be used for the inspection and repairs of the Coast Guard HC-144 listed components. Applicable documentation or specifications revealed, published or updated prior to award or during the course of the contract period shall be considered within the scope of this requirement and may be added to the contract by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />3.4 Provide an uncontrolled copy of the company's quality manual.<br />3.5 Have or have access to, a FAA Designated Engineering Representative (DER) and capability to engineer composite components including metal structures from samples. <br />3.5.1 Submit upon USCG request a written quote detailing the manufacturing process as well as drawings to the USCG Contracting Officer for MRS Division Engineering Officer's approval.

<p>GENERAL GUIDANCE<br />Please use the following ratings to score the performance elements below (assessments should reflect only contractor-liable performance):</p>
<p>RATING DESCRIPTION<br />Exceptional Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to your organization's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.<br />Very Good Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to your organization's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.<br />Satisfactory Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory.<br />Marginal Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the evaluation area being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented<br />Unsatisfactory Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the evaluation area being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.</p>
<p>EVALUATION: Rate the contractor in each of the following Evaluation Areas.<br />Quality of Product or Service. Assess the contractor's conformance to contract requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g., specified technical, professional, environmental, or safety and health standards). List and assess any sub-elements to indicate different efforts where appropriate. For example: Are reports/data accurate? Does the service provided meet the specifications of the contract? Does the contractor's work measure up to commonly accepted technical or professional standards? Assess the degree of direction given by your organization to solve problems that arise during performance.</p>
<p>RATING Exceptional Very Good Satisfactory Marginal Unsatisfactory N/A<br />Check &#61654;</p>
<p>Comment(s):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />B. Schedule. Assess the timeliness of the contractor against the completion of the contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules, and administrative requirements (e.g., efforts that contribute to or effect the schedule variance). This assessment of the contractor's adherence to the required delivery schedule should include the contractor's efforts during the assessment period that contributes to or effect the schedule variance. This element applies to contract closeout activities as well as contract performance. Instances of adverse actions such as the assessment of liquidated damages, or issuance of Cure Notices, Show Cause Notices, and Delinquency Notices are indicators of problems which may have resulted in variance to the contract schedule and should therefore be noted in the evaluation.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 11.105(a)(1), the particular brand name, product, or feature is essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates other companies' similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's needs. 
							
The Applied Medical Technologies (AMT) Bridal is the only naso-jejunal feeding tube securement device that meets the clinical needs of our medical center.  
The AMT Bridal is a unique naso-jejunal feeding tube securement system designed to secure the feeding tube in place using the structural anatomy of the patient vs. universal adhesive securement systems.  Comprised to 2 primary components, these components are inserted into the nares of the patient and using rare earth magnets, lock together in the naso-pharynx.  Once locked, one component is retracted, pulling a securement strap over the Volmer bone and through the bilateral nares creating a strong system of securement that relies not on adhesives, but rather on the structural anatomy of the patient.  
Significant time and expense has been directed over the last 2 years in training staff to safely and confidently utilize this device to secure naso-jejunal feeding tubes in at risk patients.  Time and expense that will have been wasted if the organization is forced to move to a different product for contracting reasons rather than expert clinical judgement.

<p><strong>Question:</strong> For CLIN 0003 - Are you looking for only the vest price?&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three sections that lead me to believe that a vest should include different things ...Under "Classification" in the PD on page 1 it says, "Vest shall be of 1 type in 1 size with 2 expansion panels (assuming 1 small and 1 large)." Under "Accessories" in the PD on page 1 it says, the accessories in the list are for separate/individual purchase. Under 3.3.1 "Vest" it says the vest shall have the sewn-in pockets and various modular removable&nbsp; pockets (General Pocket large and small, &amp; Radio) and then it lists all the "optional" components.<br />For CLIN 0002 - "Base Vest and all Pockets" confirmation. This means the 1. Base Vest, 2. General Pocket Large, 3. General Pocket Small, 4. Radio Pocket, correct?&nbsp; A "system" makes me think it's all items including what's listed in 3.3.2.<br /><br /><em><strong>Response:</strong> "Complete system" (CLIN 0002)&nbsp;and "Airsave vests" (CLIN 0003) both include one (1) of each item depicted in Drawing No. 5-31-100, specifically the following:<br />AF Airsave Vest Sub-Assembly;<br />Label Identification;<br />Horizontal Mounting Panel;<br />Crew Regulator Unit/ Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (CRU/JHMCS) Attachment Assembly;<br />Expansion Panel, 1 Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment (MOLLE) - (Small);<br />Expansion Panel, 2 Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment (MOLLE) - (Large);<br />General Pocket Assembly - Small; <br />General Pocket Assembly - Large;<br />Radio Pocket Assembly; and<br />Helmet Mounted Integrated Targeting System (HMIT) Attachment<br /><br />The government may wish to acquire any of these items individually during sustainment and in follow-on contracts.<br /><br /></em><strong>Question:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>[Contractor]&nbsp;has a question regarding CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0002 ... <span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Shouldn't the FAT be due after the materials are approved by the government? If we are correct in understanding, then we would have additional time after the testing and approval to deliver the FAT garment.<br /><br /><em><strong>Response:</strong> The government is working under an expedited&nbsp;timeframe for this acquisition. For this reason, the government will simultaneously perform testing on materials and the first article provided. Both will be evaluated individually for compliance with the material requirements and pattern compliance respectively.</em></span></p>

Flow down required in accordance with paragraph (d) of FAR clause 52.247-64. <BR> <BR>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) The contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority.

(2) Investigative requirements for IT Service Contracts are: (i) High Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI). (ii) Moderate Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI).

Processing requirements for High and Moderate Risk Contracts are as follows: (1) The contractor must complete and submit the following forms to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR): (i) Standard Form 85P (SF-85P), Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions; (ii) FD-258, Fingerprint Chart with OPM's designation in the ORI Block; and (iii) Credit Release Authorization. (2) The Sponsor will ensure that these forms have been properly completed, initiate the CD-254, Contract Security Classification Specification, and forward the documents to the cognizant Security Officer. (3) Upon completion of security processing, the Office of Security, through the servicing Security Officer and the Sponsor, will notify the contractor in writing of an individual's eligibility to be provided access to a Department of Commerce facility or Department of Commerce IT system. (4) Security processing shall consist of limited personal background inquiries pertaining to verification of name, physical description, marital status, present and former residences, education, employment history, criminal record, personal references, medical fitness, fingerprint classification, and other pertinent information. For non-U.S. citizens, the Sponsor must request an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check. It is the option of the Office of Security to repeat the security processing on any contract employee at its discretion. (e) Notification of Disqualifying Information. If the Office of Security receives disqualifying information on a contract employee, the COR will be notified. The Sponsor, in coordination with the Contracting Officer, will immediately remove the contract employee from duties requiring access to Departmental facilities or IT systems.

(f) Failure to comply with security processing requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of contract employees from Department of Commerce facilities or denial of access to IT systems. (g) Access to National Security Information. Compliance with these requirements shall not be construed as providing a contract employee clearance to have access to national security information. (h) The contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts. <BR> <BR>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING WITH ENTITIES THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN INTERNAL CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS?REPRESENTATION (FEB 2015) (a)	In accordance with section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Resolution Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.

(b)  The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. 
	(c) Representation.  By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract.

The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold.

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA), Great Lakes Region 5, announces an opportunity to provide General Construction Services for the Restoration of Wood Paneling Project at the U.S. Post Office located at 211 S. Clark Street in Chicago, Illinois. The procurement will be issued as a lump sum, firm fixed-price contract open to all business concerns. The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. The NAICS code is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The Small Business Size Standard is $36.5 Million.<br /><br />
<p>Project Scope: The intent of the project is to repair and restore historic wood paneling, wood doors, wood trim work, as well as other associated woodwork. The project will also include the fabrication and installation of a new decorative bronze metal railing system to protect the woodwork from future damage. The Loop Station Post Office building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, so all work must be performed in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. The duration of the contract is 210 calendar days from Notice to Proceed to Final Completion.</p>
<p>The "best value trade-off process" will be utilized in this procurement for the evaluation of offers and the selection of the successful Offeror to receive the award.  The Government will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of both the technical factors and the total evaluated price.  For this procurement, the technical factors will be significantly more important than price.  The technical factors will include past experience on similar projects, experience of key personnel and past performance on similar projects.</p>
<p>Small Business Participation:  This procurement is unrestricted and is therefore open to both large and small business concerns. Although this procurement is open to large business, small businesses are encouraged to participate. The offeror will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, disadvantaged, veteran owned, service disabled veteran owned and HUBZone businesses through subcontracting opportunities.  In the event a large business (small businesses are not subject to this requirement) is the awardee, an acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by SBA prior to award of this contract. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to have participation from small, small disadvantaged, small woman-owned, small HUBZone and small veteran-owned business concerns.</p>
<p>Joint Ventures: Joint venture or firm/ consultant arrangements will be considered and must submit an acceptable joint venture agreement.</p>
<p>Interested Parties/How to Offer: The solicitation package will only be available electronically. <strong>The solicitation package will be available on November 13, 2015.</strong> Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation package from the FedBizOpps website, https://www.fbo.gov, and for monitoring for possible amendments and/or additional information.</p>
<p><strong>A pre-proposal conference and site-visit will be held on November 30, 2015&nbsp;@ 9:00 a.m. (CST). </strong>Notification to the Contract Specialist of proposed attendance will be required.  We consider attendance at this conference vital to the preparation of a competitive and cost effective proposal and to understanding the total result desired by the Government. Failure to attend this meeting may not be used as an excuse for omissions and miscalculations in offers. <strong>The offers are due on December 14, 2015 at 4:00 pm. (CST).</strong></p>
<p>In order to be eligible for award offerors are required to provide electronic representations and certifications in System for Award Management (SAM) accessed via https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

<DESC>Added November 17th 2015.&nbsp; See attached pictures of catch basin.<br /><br />RFI questions and answers from contractor.<br /><br />1. How deep is it to either the top or the bottom of the existing pipe?<br /><strong>A: The existing pipe that was exposed by CG personnel was approximately 36 inches deep.<br /></strong><br />2. What is reason for replacing current pipe? Is it crushed? Does it not have proper fall? Other?<br /><strong>A: The existing clay pipe has collapsed and will not draining into the storm drain catch basin located by the fence line.<br /></strong><br />3. Based on what I read in scope of work, am I correct to interpret that there are two catch basins (one at each end)and they are both in good condition?<br />Therefore neither one needs replaced as part of this solicitation?<br /><strong>A: The catch basins seemed to be in good condition. The road catch basin seems to be the old 6 inch clay pipe. I have attached additional pictures of the road catch basin. As for the catch basin by the fence line, it seems to be <br />in good condition.<br /></strong><br />4. Is there any asphalt that need removed to access the catch basins to tie in the drain pipe?<br /><strong>A: It doesn't seem any asphalt needs to be removed to access the catch basins.</strong>
<p>5. Are there sprinkler system lines in the area to be excavated? If so, will they be marked prior to work beginning? Or is that the responsibility of contractor?<br /><strong>A: There are sprinklers in the area. Sprinkler will be marked by CG personnel before starting the job.<br /></strong><br />6. Are there any underground utilities in the area to be excavated?<br />A: Doesn't seem any underground utilities exist in the area but I would use caution while excavating. The Coast Guard has been using this base since the 1930s.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><strong>IFB PROJECT DETAILS: CA FLAP CR36(1), Hammonton-Smartsville Road</strong>
<p>The Hammonton-Smartsville Road project is located in the center-eastern limits of Yuba County, California. This project will provide resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation to 0.97 miles of roadway from just west of South Golden Parkway to the Hammonton-Smartsville Road/Chuck Yeager Road intersection. There will be a bid option to extend the project 0.14 miles east to include improvements to the intersection, and replacement of the existing bridge just east of the intersection with a reinforced concrete box culvert. In either case, work will be continuous for entire length of the project, with no suspensions.</p>
<p>The major work elements include full-depth reclamation of the existing road to a depth of six inches, and three inches of asphalt surfacing on a twelve-inch aggregate base. Traffic is consistently heavy all year round, with a current ADT of 2726. There will be up to 15 minute delays during construction. There will be no road closures. Weather conditions typically allow construction to commence in early Spring so as to take advantage of the dry summer construction season.</p>
<p>The project will include drainage and safety improvements, construction of a soil nail wall for slope stabilization, and MSE wall construction.</p>
<p>The primary work items are soil nail wall, MSE wall, subexcavation, full depth reclamation, aggregate base, asphalt pavement, reinforced concrete box culvert, drainage improvements, signing, and pavement markings. Significant quantities for the overall project include:</p>

<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.</p>
<p>The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which mission it is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.<br />The NCATS Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) is tasked with identifying and developing novel small molecule leads against a wide spectrum of human disease targets, which it accomplishes by screening thousands of small molecules in collaboration with both intra-and extramural researchers. In pursuit of this goal, the Center has a strong internal transdisciplinary team of scientists who continually discover novel small molecules for application against a wide range of human diseases.<br />Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase type-2 alpha (PIP4K2) catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns5P) on the fourth hydroxyl of the myo-inositol ring, to form phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2). It may exert its function by regulating the levels of PtdIns5P, which functions in the cytosol by increasing AKT activity and in the nucleus signals through ING2 and ay regulate the pool of cytosolic PtdIns5P in response to the activation of tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, PIP4K2 may also negatively regulate insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by lowering the levels of PtdIns5P and may be involved in thrombopoiesis, and the terminal maturation of megakaryocytes and regulation of their size.<br />Lysine-specific demethylase 5B (KDM5B) is a histone demethylase that demethylates 'Lys-4' of histone H3, thereby playing a central role in histone code. KDM5B does not demethylate histone H3 'Lys-9' or H3 'Lys-27'. It demethylates trimethylated, dimethylated and monomethylated H3 'Lys-4' and acts as a transcriptional corepressor for FOXG1B and PAX9. It favors the proliferation of breast cancer cells by repressing tumor suppressor genes such as BRCA1 and HOXA5. In contrast, KDM5B may act as a tumor suppressor for melanoma and represses the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer-mediated transcriptional activation of the core clock component PER2.<br />Both these proteins are of great interest to study for NCGC and hence, we seek to profile 5 proprietary compounds against these proteins (each) using surface plasmon resonance. We have previously worked with this vendor who developed a custom, proprietary method for running the SPR against another target, IDH1. The results were used as part of the CBC project and we now expect to continue using these precise services to allow for continuity of data.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this requirement is to obtain bioanalytical testing services to characterize PIP4K2 and KDM5B and then assess 5 compounds for each protein.</p>
<p>The vendor shall characterized ATP, ADP, and 1 control compound against three forms of PIP4K2 and characterizes full-length and truncated form of KDM5B. Upon completion of these services, the contractor shall profile 5 small molecules for PIP4K2 and KDM5 each using a proprietary method used previously against IDH1. The contract shall aslo provide binding constant to NCGC within 4 weeks of start of experiment. The NCATS Chemical Genomics Center NCGC is responsible for providing vendor with proteins and compounds.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance: 5 weeks after receipt of the contract award</p>

<DESC>GUIS Opal Beach Parking Lot/Road Removal

SYNOPSIS: The Gulf Islands National Seashore (GUIS), a unit of the National Park Service (NPS), has a requirement for the removal of two remnant, abandoned parking lots and associated road segments at the South Opal Beach and North Opal Beach in Northwest Florida.  On or about November 16th the Government intends to issue an invitation to bid (IFB) for a single, firm-fixed price contract for dismantling, demolition, or removal of improvements.  This beach enhancement restoration project will restore the natural viewshed to improve visitors' experience.   

LOCATION: Opal Beach Area of Gulf Islands National Seashore is situated on Santa Rosa Island along J. Earle Bowden Way (State Road 399), which connects eastern Pensacola Beach to Navarre Beach, Florida.  The project area is bordered by sensitive habitat and two wetlands.

SUMMARY: The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment and incidentals necessary to perform the excavation, loading and removal activities (to include hauling and dumping) a combined surface area of approximately 1.75 acres. All construction and demolition (C&D) debris shall be transported in a secure manner for off-site disposal or recycling.
  
C&D is defined in 62-701.200 (25) Florida Administrative Code 62-701.200 Definitions.
(25) "Construction and demolition debris" means discarded materials generally considered to be not water soluble and non-hazardous in nature, including but not limited to steel, glass, brick, concrete, asphalt material, pipe, gypsum wallboard, and lumber, from the construction or destruction of a structure as part of a construction or demolition project or from the renovation of a structure, including such debris from construction of structures at a site remote from the construction or demolition project site. The term includes rocks, soils, tree remains, trees, and other vegetative matter which normally results from land clearing or land development operations for a construction project; clean cardboard, paper, plastic, wood, and metal scraps from a construction project; effective January 1, 1997, except as provided in Section 403.707(13)(j), F.S., unpainted, non-treated wood scraps from facilities manufacturing materials used for construction of structures or their components and unpainted, non-treated wood pallets provided the wood scraps and pallets are separated from other solid waste where generated and the generator of such wood scraps or pallets implements reasonable practices of the generating industry to minimize the commingling of wood scraps or pallets with other solid waste; and de minimis amounts of other nonhazardous wastes that are generated at construction or demolition projects, provided such amounts are consistent with best management practices of the construction and demolition industries. Mixing of construction and demolition debris with other types of solid waste will cause it to be classified as other than construction and demolition debris.

Debris from a construction or demolition project that meets the current definition of C&D waste can be disposed in a C&D landfill or Material Recovery Facility.  The preferred option for managing any type of solid waste is to reuse or recycle the waste, whenever feasible.  Nonhazardous C&D debris is not federally regulated by EPA.  State and local regulations may limit where C&D debris can be disposed and may also require recycling a minimum percentage of the C&D debris generated. Visit www.cicacenter.org for more information.

DESCRIPTION: Work consists of the removal of debris in estimated quantities specified in the contract documents, which may include one or more of the following:

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons<br />Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA<br />intends to award on an other than full and open competition basis a firm fixed price (FFP) contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to procure 86 each Flight Termination Receivers (FTR) to Kratos-Lancaster, 3061 Industry Dr., Lancaster, PA 17603, manufacturer part number 570006. Anticipated award date is February 15, 2016. The delivery schedule is to NAWCWD, China Lake, CA by August 2016.
<p>The FTR is a critical subcomponent of a Flight Termination System (FTS). The FTS used by Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) free flight testing activities has been certified for use in accordance with the Range Commander Council (RCC)-319-99, Flight Termination Systems Commonality Standard. Retention of FTS RCC-319-99 safety certification is necessary for the use of the RCC member range(s) needed for the execution of required JSOW flight test(s). Due to the strict safety requirements of RCC-319-99, only the above mentioned part meets agency needs. These FTS subcomponents are unique to the manufacturer, thus no drop-in-replacement second source exists. Any substitution of a new subcomponent automatically invalidates the RCC-319-99 safety certification for the FTS.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses and questions may be submitted to NAWCWD Contract Specialist Melinda Childs by email (preferred): melinda.childs@navy.mil, fax to (760) 939-3095, or mail to Commander Code 220000D, NAWCWD, 429 E. Bowen Ave, MS 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108.</p>

This sole-source procurement is necessary to allow adequate time to bridge the gap in service provided under contract W9124J-15-C-0077 which was placed in a stop work status as a result of a GAO Protest. This action will be procured via the Information Technology Enterprise Solutions - 2 Services (ITES-2S) contract under Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS). The requested extension is through no later than 29 February 2016. This will allow adequate time for resolution of the protest and execution of the final decision.
