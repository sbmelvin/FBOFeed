<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate a modification to Contract HHSP23320054304EC with the Boston College Graduate School of Social Work, Boston College Office of Sponsored Programs, 140 Commonwealth Avenue, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467, on a sole source basis to assist in funding technical assistance to and oversight/monitoring of state agencies and local/regional organizations that are implementing self-directed home and community-based services for Americans with chronic disabilities, of all ages and with broad range of disabling conditions.  The basis for restricting competition is the authority of 41USC 253(c)(1) because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy DHHS requirements.  

The contract modification will enable ASPE to continue to partner with private philanthropies and other government agencies in funding a research and technical assistance center at Boston College (the National Resource Center for Participant-Directed Services) whose purpose is to diffuse specialized knowledge and expertise about innovative approaches to consumer-directed services.  ASPE previously partnered with the Robert Wood Johnson to sponsor the pioneering Cash and Counseling Demonstration and Evaluation (1995-2005) and with the RWJF, the Retirement Research Fund and the DHHS Administration on Aging in support of the Cash and Counseling Replication Initiative (2004-2008).  In 2008, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Atlantic Philanthropies awarded core support for the Boston College National Resource Center for Participant Direction and several government agencies (AoA, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs) also funded the Center to provide technical assistance to Older Americans Act, Medicaid, and Veterans Affairs-funded programs offering self-directed services and supports.  ASPE intends to contribute a small amount of funding for special projects that will complement and enhance the research and technical assistance activities already funded by the Center’s other sponsors.

Therefore, a major requirement for the contractor is expertise and experience with regard to the planning and implementation of self-directed services programs in a variety of state settings.  Boston College has, on staff, the project director for the original CCDE and second phase replication effort who clearly possesses the relevant expertise and experience.  Any other contractor proposing would be required to demonstrate 1) expertise and experience with respect to the “Cash and Counseling” Demonstration and Evaluation sufficient to provide extensive technical assistance to states on replicating the “cash and counseling” innovation in their states and 2) have non-governmental funds available to support the technical assistance activities equal to the total amount  that the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (approximately $4.75 million) and Atlantic Philanthropies (approximately $3.5 million) have awarded to establish and sustain the Boston College Center for Participant Home and Community-Based Home and Community-based Services over the next three years.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirement as described above including a specific statement addressing the second factor listed above (source of additional funding).  No solicitation document is available.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, the U.S. Census Bureau intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Assistant To Payroll Processing, for the provision of services to assist in the management of time and attendance and payroll processing.  The referenced company has unique capabilities due to specialized relevant experience that will produce an efficient review and consultation of procedures and trouble shooting of problems that may arise during the processing of attendance, payroll, and other relevant reports.  The work will take place at the U.S. Census National Processing Center in Jeffersonville, Indiana.  Assistant To Payroll is the only known source with the required specialized expertise to meet the requirements.  This is not a solicitation announcement or an invitation for bids.  Information received regarding this announcement will only be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Otherwise, the Census Bureau believes it is in its best interest to award an order to Assistant to Payroll Processing for management services.  Inquiries may be addressed to Clark Terrell, Contract Specialist, NPC Procurement.

<DESC><p>Construct a CMU enclosure. CMU block consists of split face with a ground face accent band and a precast sandstone cap. Block will be staggered and the mortared joints will be tooled. Concrete will be 4,000 psi at a depth of 6" with 2" chairs and #4 rebar. This will be a monolithic pour with a smooth finish and saw cuts every 10'. The concrete will be doweled into the existing concrete and epoxy will be used. 6" concrete filled steel bollards, which will be set 3' below grade and be located along the back wall of the enclosure and the outside corners of the enclosure. A sleeve should be placed around the bollards. Bollards should be powder coated. Fill and grade the project area. Base course will consist of crushed 3/4" stone at a depth of 6", stabilized sub-grade and compact all materials to 95-100% compaction. Match existing grade.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>The modification will require the perform work inside the powerhouse as follows:  1) install new fixtures in six (6) restrooms; 2) prepare, prime and paint interior wall surfaces; and 3) strip and reseal all floors.  Additional rationale for issuing a modification to the existing contract:  1)  The contractor has experience with working around power generation schedules due to the operation of rotating equipment.   2)  The contractor has experience with working around the existing contractor whos performing on-site rehabilitation of generator units 2 and 3.  3) The contractor has experience in working around high voltage equipment, arc flash hazard, and suspended platforms. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen circumstance encountered during the job.
