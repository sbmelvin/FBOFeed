The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

1. This service is set aside for SDVOSB, however a full service contract was incorporated into the non- proprietary portion of inspection testing. The remaining service contract was written in such a way that only one subcontractor can be used, Johnson Controls (Simplex Grinnell). I would like to request alternative means of accomplishing this. If the verbiage remains the same the dollar value of the contract is dictated in full by a proprietary company (Johnson Controls) that holds a monopoly on the programming portion of this contract. I'd like to request if service and repairs can be assigned as a separate CLIN to be charged against and has the same value for all prospective contractors. In doing this, the VA will not overpay for services that may or may not ever happen. This coupled with the fact that at any time the prime SDVOSB contractor has to use Johnson Controls they can order their services off GSA schedule to offset direct costs to the VA. I do not foresee the need to incorporate programming into an inspection and testing contract and carry with it a very large fixed price dictated by Johnson controls that will exceed the internal government estimate. 90% of this contract is non-proprietary so we don t see a need to separate the programming from the service contract.

2. The site visit was held yesterday March 6, 2019 at 2:00. We were in attendance and this did not conclude until almost 4:00. The RFI questions were then due by 5:00 pm. This is not a reasonable time frame to submit questions directly related to the site visit that occurred 1 hour prior. Request extending RFI questions and answers.  Solicitation was extended from 7 March 2019 NLT 1200PM EST to 12 March 2019 NLT 1200PM EST.

3. Based on our previous RFI's it was asked about the sprinkler and suppression service portion of the contract. A clear answer was not provided instead it directed us to section 8. We want to ensure we are providing everything asked for by the VA and clear any ambiguity that may exist. Based on the service portion of this solicitation what is the intent of the VA? We have confirmed it currently covers all fire alarm; will this also be extended to sprinkler, suppression and fire pumps? You will have to service all fire alarm equipment and parts directly attach. I.e. tamper valves, pipe that flow switch is attach to. Suppression and fire pump deficiencies reported during inspection are part of contract.

4. I attended the site visit yesterday and appreciate Dominique's time yesterday showing us the site.  I realize that the RFI question deadline was at 5pm yesterday and the bid is due today at noon.  I am requesting an extension on this, there isn't enough time to gather all information from yesterday and put a quote together for such a large project.  I would also like to discuss the contract language since you were not available yesterday.  It's set aside for SDVOSB yet the way the contract is laid out it would be impossible to satisfy the 51% of the work being that it's a SimplexGrinnell system that requires proprietary parts and programming etc.  We will send another email and/or are available for a phone call if it's easier to discuss over the phone but I wanted to send something this morning to get things moving due to the time constraints. 90% of this contract is non-proprietary that can be complete any company. 
5. Do you know if this was set aside to SDVOSB for the last contract, and do you know who the incumbent was and the total contract value of the contract?  The initial contract award was in 2014, precedent to PL 109-461. The incumbent was Simplexgrinnell LP, and the total contract value was $297,550.


 
6. Will there be a site visit scheduled for this solicitation?  Yes. Date provided in section E4 of the solicitation under Price factor.
7. Device Counts-Do you have a count of how many elevators there are at this site?  Please confirm the amount of wet and dry risers, as well as the tamper switches.  There are 300 dampers, and it also shows 100 smoke fire damper tamper switches, please elaborate on what the tamper switches are for. 
There are 23 Elevators, we have 2 parking deck, 6 outlying buildings with sprinkler, Main building with 6 wings and 2 dry systems.
8. The QASP talks about flushing fire hydrants (11) but these are not on the device count sheet. Please confirm the hydrants, antifreeze loop quantities and co2 system quantities. The hydrants amounts are correct, as well as the antifreeze  loop and CO2 system.
9. Section 4.0.23-It states to test all dampers and provide Cad drawings, do you have any drawings for the dampers at this time, if not will we be required to create the drawings from scratch after finding the locations? We have of all dampers and location but not a drawing with all dampers
10. Section 6.0-Do you have a count of the analog smoke detectors that require sensitivity testing?  All smoke detectors on campus are addressable
11. Section 7.0-Will the contractor be responsible for providing monitoring for the duration of the project or is it being paid for on another contract? Please read 7.0 Fire Alarm Monitoring
 12. Section 8.0-Will sprinkler repairs be invoiced on a separate quote? I wanted to be clear that this is a service contract for the fire alarm system only, not sprinkler devices as well.  Sprinkler devices are inclusive , see Section 8.0 of the performance work statement.
13. Section 10.0-Please confirm that this is a full service contract to include all parts, batteries and devices listed in this section during regular business hours and does not include sprinkler repairs. 10.0 covers fire alarm and 8.0, number 4 covers sprinkler
