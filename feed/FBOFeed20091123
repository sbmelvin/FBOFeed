<DESC>Acquisition Description: Contracting Office: Department of the Air Force, Electronic Systems Center, Headquarters 754th Electronic Systems Group, Enterprise Services Division (HQ 754 ELSG/ES), Acquisition Directorate, 200 East Moore Drive, Maxwell Air Force Base - Gunter Annex, Alabama 36114-3000 and HQ 754 Transportation System Flight ((HQ 754 ELSG/ILT) has a Brand Name requirement for (a) the purchase of twenty two Intermec Model CK61GB Handheld Terminals for Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS). "This is a not solicitation/request for quote. "This is a notice of the Government's intent to award on a sole source basis to a follow-on contract". This requirement will close on 29 Nov 2009 at 1700 hours Central Standard Time (CST). All submissions should be e-mailed to john.crowell@gunter.af.mil. "An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns for this acquisition. Before consulting the Ombudsman concerned parties should firs! t address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution. In addition, AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and the resulting contract. The ESC Ombudsman is the ESC Director, Commander's Staff, and can be contacted at: ESC/DS Bldg 1606 9 Eglin Street Hanscom AFB, MA 01731; Telephone #: 781-377-5106; Facsimile #: 781-377-4659; E-Mail: ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil. For specific questions, please contact Mr. John Crowell, Senior Contract Technical Advisor at (334) 416-4737 or Ms. Sharon F. Stallings, Contracting Officer, at (334) 416-1659. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION FOR CK61GB Handheld Terminals use secure socket layer traffic as part of an integrated security program which supports TRANSCOM. It is imperative that the developmental environment matches the operational environment to ensure completeness in testing. Without the purchase of this hardware and its associated devices! , the required testing before fielding new software and/or system architecture changes would not be able to take place. This could adversely affect CMOS and users in the field DoD wide with the introduction of new software and/or system architecture changes that are not thoroughly tested. The Government's minimum needs can only be satisfied with the purchase of this hardware and maintenance. This purchase allows the developmental environment to match the operational environment. A failure to purchase specified hardware and maintenance would prevent the Transportation Flight from meeting current customer requirements of thoroughly tested changes to software and system architecture.

<DESC>THERE ARE NO FUNDS AGAINST THIS BAA SOLICITATION.  The Electronic System Center(ESC)Intelleligence,Surveillance,and Reconnaissance(ISR)Group, 630 Electronic Systems Squadron Combat Identification Squadron(630 ELSS/CI) is responsible for the transition of promising cooperative and non-cooperative combat identification (CID) technologies from the laboratory to operational platforms. To facilitate the execution of this responsibility, the 630 ELSS/CI Open Broad Agency Announcement(BAA)is developed to quickly identify, develop, evaluate, demonstrate, and transition promising CID technology to operational platforms.  This BAA is conducted using full and open competition. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this BAA is presumed to be 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. Although no portion of this BAA has been set aside for small business, small disadvantaged businesses, historically underutilized business zone businesses, h! istorically black colleges and universities, and/or minority institutions, participation from all these organizations is highly encouraged. In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process.The first step will be the submission of a white paper.  If after review of the white paper, the technical POC feels the concept warrants further consideration, a proposal will be requested (step two). Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting organization  will be awarded a contract.  Instructions for the submission of white papers and proposals are contained in the BAA. The submission of a white paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal.  Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance of award. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA.  Technical evaluation will employ a peer or scientific review process.  A proposal's te! chnical evaluation, past performance, and funding are primary basis for contract award.  Cost reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.  White papers will be accepted continuously through 30 November 2010. This BAA will remain open continuously through 31 December 2010.  The BAA technical areas of interest are: Identify promising Combat Identification (CID) technology candidates, Develop models or prototypes of the CID technology, Conduct demonstrations in operationally relevant environments, and Accelerate transition of the technology to operational platforms.  All questions may be directed to the technical point of contact listed in pages 2 and 3 of the BAA.

<a href="mailto:beth.kay.chapman@us.army.mil">Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AMCOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate of the US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command proposes to procure two each Rotor Azimuth Processors (RAP). The RAP is designed for use with helicopter tachometer and contractor signals to measure rotor azimuth position and main rotor speed; two rotor contact signals and one rotor tachometer signal. Signal inputs consist of electronic waveforms from Tachometers and Contactors and cover operational ranges for all current US Army helicopters. The outputs are main rotor azimuth position, main rotor speed and tail rotor azimuth position. All of these signals require signal conditioning to take the input signals and then producing the other required output signals in required formats. The outputs are main rotor azimuth position, main rotor speed and tail rotor azimuth position. The main rotor and tail rotor azimuths are analog ramps that represent 0 to 360 degrees. The analog signals are provided through a single 12-bit parallel interface. The processors will convert tachometer pulses per second to percent rotor speed. The three analog signals are provided through  three 12-bit parallel interfaces. The rotor azimuth processor will provide all the necessary information and will operate in a manner consistent with rotor testing requirements. This self-contained RAP will be used for flight and ground support test purposes. This product will include a PC configuration software program, embedded data acquisition software, and analog data acquisition hardware. Market research has indicated that one company can meet this requirement. We intend to award a FAR Part 12 commercial order to Precision Systems, Inc., 453 Easton Road, Horsham, PA 19044, which is the only known manufacturer that can satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): Russell Construction Co. Inc, W52H09-08-D-5005/0027<br><br>This notice is for 7 change orders due to differing site conditions.  Subject project was awarded to Russell Construction Co. Inc. of Davenport, IA on firm fixed price task order W52H09-08-D-5005/0027 on July 15, 2009.  The project consists of design, demolition and repair of concrete and structure on the designated area of the old and new sections of the Hydro-Electric Plant/Building 160. The contractor's proposal for this task order was based, in part, on an underwater survey conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers in 2008.  During contractor's own underwater investigation, the contractor discovered a significant void in one of the foundations, a cast iron gate that cannot be repaired, a missing cornerstone, a scour area that undermines the outlet tunnel.  It was also determined that additional investigations are needed due to inconsistencies with the report provided by the Army Corps of Engineers and the contractor's own investigations   to ensure the structural integrity of the dam. The estimated price range of these change orders is between $250,000 and $500,000.  The change orders will be awarded as a firm fixed price modification under task order 0027 under contract W52H09-08-D-5005.  Contract W52H09-08-D-5005 was awarded under full and open competition with the use of best value source selection procedures to Russell Construction Co. Inc. of Davenport, Iowa on August 21, 2008.  The design build and construction services proposed to be awarded under this contract include the type of work designated in this synopsis.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis
RECOVERY - Rapid Ecoregional Assessment Support Services - Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Contracts
Classification Code:  F - National Resources & Conservation 
NAICS Code:  541620 - Environmental Consulting Services
The intent of this sources sought synopsis is to identify sources capable of performing rapid ecoregional assessment services on land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  This is not a request for proposals.
The Department of the Interior, BLM, Division of Resource Services, intends to contract for services to conduct rapid ecoregional assessments on a significant portion of the Western United States and Alaska over the next several years.  The BLM intends to award multiple IDIQ contracts these assessments services.  Individual assessments will be contracted for as task orders and competed with the firms who have basic IDIQ contracts with the BLM for these services.  Each assessment will be completed in less than 18 months.  Each assessment will be firm-fixed-price.  
At a minimum, these assessments issued as task orders will provide information and analysis necessary to determine the status of three categories of conservation values [1) native species, 2) terrestrial ecosystems, and 3) aquatic ecosystems] and the affect of four change agents [1) climate change, 2) wildland fire, 3) invasive species, and 4) development in the form of renewable energy, conventional energy, and urbanization] upon these conservation values.  These assessments will inform the BLMs landscape-scale conservation, restoration, adaptation, development, and mitigation strategies.  These assessments will also provide a venue to facilitate cross-jurisdictional collaboration and partnerships.
Rapid ecoregional services to be acquired by the issuance of competitive task orders under the multiple IDIQ contracts will include such items as 1) assessment of resource status, and quantification of risk from current and potential exposure to change agents; 2) collection and compilation of existing data; 3) geospatial analysis, modeling, and data management; 4) report preparation and meeting facilitation; and 5) stakeholder and cooperator engagement.
Some task orders may be supported using funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA or stimulus funds).  The IDIQ contracts will include the required ARRA clauses.
The period of performance effort for the IDIQ contracts is one year with four option years from the data of contract award.  It is estimated that each IDIQ contract will have a minimum total order amount of $5,000 and a maximum total order amount of $10 Million.
The NAICS code is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of $7 million.
It is essential that any prospective awardees be responsible and responsive in performing these services.  Interested sources that think they possess the capabilities to perform these support services should submit electronically a Statement of Capability of not more than five pages to the point of contact detailed below.  Any proprietary information should be identified and marked.
This Statement of Capability shall include:1) the firms name and address, DUNS number, business size, and the names to two principals who may be contacted with title, phone number, and email address,2) ability of the firm to meet the described requirements,3) experience of the firm in providing similar services, 4) management capabilities of the firm, 5) similar Government contracts under which the firm performed, 6) other similar contracts under which the firm performed, 7) professionals on-staff with or retained by the firm with a statement of each persons with relevant qualifications, education, and experience, and 8) any other information pertinent to supporting the firms ability to perform the described services.   
This statement is for market research purposes only and should be not viewed as a proposal.
Statements of Capability may be sent electronically to Cheryl Flanagan, Contracting Officer, at Cheryl_Flanagan@blm.gov on or before December 1, 2009 at 5 p.m. mountain time.  Submissions in any other manner or that exceed five pages will not be honored.

<p>Location:<br />Procurement and Grants Office (Atlanta)</p>
<p>Title: Assessment on Emerging Forms of Commercial Sex Work in Vietnam</p>
<p>Description(s):<br />The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Procurement and Grants Office announces the upcoming release of the solicitation to assess (i) the emerging forms of sex work, (ii) social networks that exist to facilitate their activities and the extent of overlapping with the existing street- or EE-based sex network, drug using and MSM networks, (iii) risks and reasons for risk exposures among members of these networks in regards to HIV, Sexually Transmitted Inections (STIs) and other public health problems, and (iv) their exposures to existing HIV/AIDS services.</p>
<p>This assessment aims to complement the IBBS by conducting a rapid assessment using qualitative methods to answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What does the current picture of sex work look like in Vietnam? <br />This assessment will re-explore the current context of sex work in Vietnam and determine if there are new forms of sex work or whether the types of sex work in Vietnam need to be redefined. It also helps to determine what types of networks exist (including those overlapping with drug-using and MSM networks) and their linkages in order to understand how HIV might spread through these networks. Information obtained, including forms of sex work and prevalence, types of networks, operational characteristics (e.g., time/venues/modes of client solicitation, venues of sexual acts and mobility [including seasonal and migratory sex work]), and the actual risks involved in each form of sex work) through the assessment will inform HIV prevention programs of how and where to successfully access/approach sex workers, particularly non street- and EE-based ones, and how to make use of their social networks to target interventions.</p>
<p>2. What are the factors that influence the engagement in high risk behaviors among those involved in the identified forms of sex work? <br />The assessment will examine circumstances, motivations and benefits of involvement in sex work as well as reasons for risk exposures among sex workers. Information obtained (including the transition from rural to urban areas/trafficking, economic/financial motivations, overlapping risk [i.e., drug use, MSM] , types of sexual partners, perception of HIV risk and preventive methods) will lend insight into the contextual factors influencing decision-making in engaging in sex work, choosing forms of sex work, selecting clients and negotiating sexual practices.</p>
<p>3. To what extent are the populations involved in the identified forms of sex work exposed to HIV prevention interventions?<br />The assessment will examine access to HIV services, including Information Education Counseling (IEC), counseling and testing, peer outreach, condom use promotion and STI and addiction services, among the populations engaged in sex work. Information on how sex workers use the services and problems they face in seeking health care and accessing these services will allow programs to identify what are the gaps and needs in providing HIV services to at risk populations and how to improve the accessibility of services among underserved groups.</p>
<p>Results of the assessment will be used to inform program planning for (i) improving existing HIV prevention interventions tailored to meet the need of CSWs in terms of vulnerability reduction and risk reduction and (ii) improve access to HIV/AIDS services among CSWs in Vietnam.</p>
<p>C.2 Project Objective -</p>
<p>The assessment has the following specific objectives:<br />&bull; To define the different types of commercial sex work and sex workers' social networks currently existing in Vietnam.<br />&bull; To assess HIV risk and vulnerability of members of the identified risk networks.<br />&bull; To provide recommendations to guide programs on the development of new interventions or strategies for improving the reach and quality of HIV prevention services for the populations involved in commercial sexual activities.</p>
<p>C.3 Scope of Work - <br />(i) The assessment will be conducted in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), and two other sites that will be determined by the in-country CDC/PEPFAR team in view of time and budget.</p>
<p>(ii) Qualitative methods will be utilized to answer the research questions described in C.1. Background and Need.</p>
<p>(iii) The contractor will develop a detailed protocol that fully describes goals and objectives, population(s) to be involved, assessment design and methods, data collection and management processes, analysis strategy, human subject related issues and findings dissemination plan. This will also include a full set of assessment instruments (i.e., informed consent form, in-depth interview guides, focus group discussion [FGD] guides, and mapping guide). The protocol and instruments must be approved by the CDC/PEPFAR prior to data collection.</p>
<p>(iv) The contractor will coordinate data collection in accordance with the approved protocol and ensure that approved assessment tools will be utilized in a proper manner. Any changes to the processes or tools must be discussed with and approved by CDC/PEPFAR. The precise number and locations of key informant interviews, and structured observations, the content of questionnaires and interview guides, and the timing of data collection will be determined in consultation with the CDC/PEPFAR and in view of budget constraints.</p>
<p>(v) The contractor will conduct data analysis in consultation with the CDC/PEPFAR. The contractor will produce preliminary findings and recommendations for reporting to the PEPFAR Vietnam team. Based upon feedback of the PEPFAR team, the contractor will produce a final report.. The contractor will work with the CDC/PEPFAR to determine the most appropriate means to present the findings and plan formal dissemination of the final report to the Vietnam Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affaires (MOLISA) and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>(vi) The project will be funded through CDC Vietnam. Publications (i.e., conference abstracts, manuscripts) that may result from this assessment will be coordinated with CDC/PEPFAR. Assessment team members, including the contractor and the CDC/PEPFAR staff, will participate in the production (including editing) of manuscript(s) for publication. Authorship will be determined based on standard authorship guidelines (e.g., based on an individual's contribution to the process). Team members will all have the opportunity to comment on drafts of manuscripts prior to submission. Final determination on manuscripts will reside with the principal author.</p>

<DESC>Description
This Request for Information (RFI) is being released by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for planning purposes only.  It shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the USDA to acquire any products or services.  If an RFP is issued, it will be officially issued by the appropriate Government contracting office.  The USDA does not intend to pay for the information requested.  All information provided is for Government planning use only – please do not provide proprietary information.
	

Background
The USDA mission is to provide leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management. The USDA is recognized as a dynamic organization that is able to efficiently provide the integrated program delivery needed to lead a rapidly evolving food and agriculture system. 
Recently, the USDA has initiated modernization efforts to replace and upgrade mission critical systems to improve the delivery of programs that support America’s farmers and rural communities.  USDA has endeavored to streamline and improve program delivery processes to be more effective and efficient.  Also important to the success of the USDA mission is reducing the burden on the workforce, improving program training, design, and administration, and delivering automated access to program applications.
Among the modernization initiatives, is the Budget and Performance Management System (BPMS) project. BPMS is a multi-agency investment in improved processes and tools to improve budget formulation, budget execution, and decision support analytics for participating agencies within the department.  The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is the managing partner for the BPMS project. Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), and Rural Development (RD) are participating agencies.  The National Information Technology Center (NITC) and the Information Technology Services (ITS) organization also maintain models in the same BPMS platform.   
FSA has developed cost and budget models using SAP Profitability and Cost Management (PCM).  The scope of these models includes:
•	Budget Formulation (Salary & Expenses)
•	Budget Execution
•	IT Project Budget Formulation
•	Cost Management
•	Performance Data Collection
FSA is interested in achieving the following modernization goals:
•	Proactively implement analytical practices to enable decision-making. 
•	Align budgets, costs, and performance information to a single business framework.
•	Automate repetitive and manual activities, tasks and processes.
•	Acquire and develop analytical competencies and dedicated roles.

It is anticipated that the future-state solution will be enabled by the PCM solution for cost modeling (i.e. the solution that is already built and in use today), other SAP solution component(s) for budget formulation and execution, and potentially SAP Strategy Management (SSM). In addition to achieving the goals mentioned above, FSA’s intent of this contract includes:

•	Developing a model that other agencies may use for their own budgetary process; or,
•	Allowing other USDA agencies to develop their own model. 

When the BPMS project is complete, FSA expects to have realized the following capabilities: 
•	Management of the Agency’s appropriated funds
•	Management of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC)
•	A modernized work load data collection tool
•	A modernized and automated work measurement (time and attendance) system
•	Strategic planning applications
•	Reporting for annual CFO statements
•	Budget formulation and execution data and exhibits
•	Interfaces with Program Assessment Rating Tools (PART), payroll, human resources and accounting systems, and external systems such as the U.S. Treasury
•	Management decision support and analytical tools 

Type of Contract
It is proposed that this will be a firm fixed price, IDIQ contract.

IRM/OPS/ENM has identified the Network Appliance (NetApp) Storage System as key components within the Departments Storage Area Network (SAN)/Network Attached Storage (NAS) infrastructure both domestically and abroad.  The equipment referenced above is used to enhance the existing Department of States (DoS) enterprise storage and disaster recovery efforts used in Bureaus and posts worldwide. Network Appliance has been an approved SAN solution through the Departments corporate Change Control Board (ITCCB) since 2005.  However, IT CCB approval for use within the Department does not constitute an official endorsement of the product by the Department nor does it mean that it is mandated for use. This approval is not to be confused with standardization of a product as an authorized exception to full and open competition pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(b)(4). Since the approval in 2005, data centers both domestically and overseas have built their production and recovery architecture on top of services that are unique to the NetApp software and hardware.  The lab being designed for the ARRA projects of Network Access Control/Perimeter Security (NAC/PS) and End-to-End Configuration Management (EECM) will need to emulate our existing environment, including disaster recovery, in every detail.  The NetApp Storage System, which is approved by the Department, has one of the best internal DoS support structures, and provides disaster recovery for many of the Departments mission critical applications such as SMART, corporate email, and Passport services making this brand name a necessity.  The capability of the Network Appliance product to perform snapshots of data, integrate with third party products such as VMware and Microsoft, and provide streamlined business continuity functions lead us to a brand name only selection.  NetApp Storage System FAS2040 will provide the necessary storage and functionality to accomplish this goal.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the DoS and these ARRA project lab requirements as a key component of our lab infrastructure.<BR><BR>IRM/OPS/ENM will purchase:	1 FAS2040 disk shelf with 12 1.0TB SATA Drives	2 FAS2040 system controllers	Advanced, foundation, and server software packs	2 year support. IRM requires the Network Appliance FAS2040 and direct telephone support on a brand name only basis.  Network Appliance is the manufacturer and only source for this license, which is proprietary to them.  Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c), is cited as the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet this projects laboratory requirements for a Storage Area Network solution that is a duplicate of the DoS current environment, has the desired performance features, and is easily installed, supportable, and cost effective.  Acquiring this product is essential for Network Access Control/Perimeter Security (NAC/PS) and End-to-End Configuration Management (EECM) to have a sufficient lab environment to emulate the Departments production environment so that the projects are able to meet its system testing goals and objectives.  In the context of Network Access Control/Perimeter Security (NAC/PS) and End-to-End Configuration Management (EECM), there is no practical alternative to Network Appliance as a Storage Area Network solution. 
The Network Appliance products have undergone test and assessment, evaluation for security testing, and received final approval of the IT CCB before installation. Network Access Control/Perimeter Security (NAC/PS) and End-to-End Configuration Management (EECM) has determined that no other product would have the capabilities to meet lab environment requirements to simulate what is currently in production.  The ability to actively duplicate data on a block level, tie into third party products to streamline storage capabilities, as well as offer multiprotocol storage access on mission critical applications at a competitive rate, make Network Appliance the only product which will fulfill all requirements.<BR><BR>

The hardware procured must match current production hardware to test the processes for firmware updates, IOS security updates, and network access control.  Valid testing cannot be conducted unless similar hardware is procured.  These same Layer 3 switch types are core equipment for command and control systems and our laboratory must be able to perform forensics and advanced troubleshooting of hardware related issues. The memory upgrade for existing Cisco equipment being utilized in the laboratory must match the memory modules currently in the switches or unexpected performance, and even failure, may result from the incompatible modules.  This may result in having to replace the entire switch at a much higher price to the government.
An added advantage of procuring similar equipment currently used in our infrastructure is after our lab evaluation process, the entire inventory of switches/routers may not need to be maintained for O&M purposes.  Since they mimic our current production environment, this equipment can then be re-configured and added to the DoS current spares inventory.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - This requirement will be funded in whole or in part by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009. This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award any contracts now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this pre solicitation notice is to advertise that the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is contracting for the interiors of the Building 1 Extension Project. The B1E will be one of the most technologically advanced buildings in the world. The laboratory combines the features of close temperature control, vibration isolation, air cleanliness, and demanding power quality into a facility of crucial national importance. The B1E consists of an L4 High Performance Lab, L5 Instrument Lab and L6 Precision. Temperature control will be achieved down to +/- 0.1 degree C in some areas, humidity control to +/- 5%, air filtration to M3.5 (class 100), and vibration control to &lt; 3 micrometers/second. At the B1E, electrical substations will be installed to transform site high voltage of 13.2 kV down to 480/277 V. State-of-the-art clean power quality will be required to meet stringent lab requirements and eliminate variables from scientific research. The new facility will provide for the current needs of quantum science research in computing and communications, nanotechnology, improved atomic clock research, high speed electronic measurements, and microfabrication of research devices.</p>
<p>The proposed B1E gross building area is approximately 137,000 square feet. Environmental and space requirements for the building are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST's most technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness. The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1E cannot be economically met with renovated laboratory space; therefore, the B1E is a necessity for NIST's continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be released on or about December 9, 2009, with an award anticipated for March, 2010. The estimated price range of this project is $50,000,000.00 to $65,000,000.00. A pre-proposal conference has been scheduled for Thursday, December 17, 2009 from 1:00 pm - 3:00 pm at the NIST Boulder Campus, located at 325 Broadway in Boulder, Colorado. Information regarding the conference will be contained in the solicitation posting. Completion time for this project is estimated at five hundred forty days (540) calendar days after the written Notice to Proceed. One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.</p>
<p>Source selection will be made using best value trade off process (FAR 15.101-1). The government will not pay for any information solicited. Offers that do not meet all the requirements or are not submitted within the allotted time will not be considered.</p>
<p>This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns. The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 236220, and the corresponding size standard for determining whether or not a firm qualifies as a small business is $33.5 million in average, annual receipts (gross) over the past three years. Although this procurement is not set aside for small business, small firms (including woman-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-Owned small firms, and service disabled Veteran-Owned business) are strongly encouraged to participate in the construction and renovation of Federal facilities. In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.

Mid-Eastern Industries is the only candidate for providing the required hardware, as they are the original developers of this equipment as well as the system it is required for.  Mid-Eastern Industries is also the only known manufacturer of an off-the-shelf militarized 28 VDC Power Supple that meets MIL-STD-461 and MIL-STD-801 as well as designed to meet Shock MIL-STD-901D, Grade B (Surface Ship Interior Space) as well as EMC: MIL-STD-461.  Development time for another vendor to ruggedize this component would take significant time and money, as well as cause changes that would delay the required delivery.
   Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018. A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated.  NSWC PCD contact is:  Scott Dubuque, 850-234-4864, scott.dubuque@navy.mil

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:yesenia.rodriguez1@amedd.army.mil">Center for Health Care Contracting</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Center for Health Care Contracting (CHCC), has a requirement for Patient Appointing Services for Various Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) CONUS-wide for the Department of Army, Department of Air Force, and Department of Navy.  CHCC intends to pursue a Multiple Award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, Task Order Contract for Non-Personal Services.  The anticipated contract period of performance will have a base year from 01 October 2010 through 30 September 2011, with four one-year option periods.  This requirement will augment the capability of the MTF staff to book health care appointments in the direct care system at MTFs for Military Health System (MHS) eligible beneficiaries.  The contractor shall provide all services necessary to make appointments and coordinate appointments with other direct care system facilities as required.  The Contractor shall be required to make outgoing appointment calls (i.e., cancellations, reschedule, warm transfer calls to clinics, etc.).  The Contractor will not make appointments with non-MTF (i.e. civilian network and/or non-network) providers or enter non-MTF (civilian network or non-network) information into the appointing system.  Appointments shall be made following MTF-provided appointing criteria and comply with MHS access to care standards as required by 32 CFR 199.17.  Appointments shall be made using only DoD approved standard appointment types, business rules, and appointment detail codes as detailed in the MHS Guide to Access Success.  This service includes, but is not limited to, verifying registration information in the appointment system, correcting and, when required, registering beneficiaries prior to making the appointment, making and canceling of patient appointments, and providing performance and management reports on the appointing process for MHS eligible beneficiaries.  While the Department of Defense has over 200 MTFs combined, use of a contractual vehicle by the MTFs is voluntary and it is anticipated that 18 MTFs will require services under this requirement.  The solicitation will be posted to the FedBizOpps website at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 04 December 2009.  Any prospective offerors will be able to download the attachments (i.e. solicitation, amendments, and any other documents) from the website.  Telephone or written requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.  A pre-proposal conference will be held and the date, time, and location will be provided in the solicitation.

<DESC><BR>Tri-Service Northwest, Southwest and Pacific Regions, collectively referred to as Logistical Support Area West (LSA-West); initiate the standardization process for nebulizer products for its 35 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical facilities in Washington, Alaska, California, Hawaii and Pacific islands.  The product line consists of nebulizers, tubing and masks in neonatal, pediatric, and adult sizes. This is new product line initiative for the LSA West Regions. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize products or product lines obtaining the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price based on volume pricing discounts utilizing a best value determination process. Standardized products will be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. <BR><BR>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the LSA-West region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.<BR><BR>The Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the LSA West Region include but are not limited to:<BR><BR>Region 11: Bassett Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA; Fairchild AFB Clinic, Fairchild AFB, WA; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA<BR><BR>Region 9/10: Naval Medical Center-San Diego, CA; 9th Medical Group Beale AFB, CA; 60th Medical Group Travis AFB, CA; Naval Hospital-Lemoore, CA; Weed Army Community Hospital, CA; 95th Medical Group Edwards AFB, CA; Naval Hospital-29 Palms, CA; 30th Medical Group Vandenberg AFB, CA; 61st Medical Squadron Los Angeles AFB, CA; Naval Hospital-Camp Pendleton, CA<BR><BR>Region 12: Med. Co. CLC-3, Kaneohe Bay, HI; 15th Medical Group Hickam AFB, HI; Naval Health Clinic Hawaii, HI; Tripler Army Medical Center, HI; U.S. Army Health Clinic Schofield Barracks, HI; 35th Medical Group Misawa AB, Japan; 374th Medical Group Yokota AB; Japan; Naval Hospital Yokosuka; Japan; U.S. Army Health Clinic Camp Zama, Japan; 3rd MLG, Camp Kinser, Okinawa, Japan; 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, Japan; Naval Hospital Okinawa, Japan; 8th Medical Support Squadron Kunsan ABM, Korea; 16th MEDLOG BN, Waegwan, Korea; 51st Medical Group, Osan AB, Korea; 121st Combat Support Hospital, Korea; 36th Medical Group Andersen AB, Guam; Naval Hospital (NH) Guam (Agana), Guam  <BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award. For additional information regarding DSCPs PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil. <BR>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is 01/10.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>The Point of Contact is Rosa Crumpton, phone: 253-968-0898, and e-mail rosa.crumpton@amedd.army.mil<BR> B. Products & Performance Required <BR>The LSA West Region is seeking Nebulizer Products which at a minimum include the product lines below. Within these regions, this product line has an estimated annual demand of $101,595. This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period.

Instructions to Vendors <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to rosa.crumpton@amedd.army.mil.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Northwest Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR>D. Evaluation Criteria <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the LSA West Regions.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR>The TPRB intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the TPRB reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date.The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed in the FBO RFQ.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/ company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company           criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a. Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b. The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.<BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative: <BR>1. Vendors must provide a complete line of nebulizer products for neonatal, pediatric and adult patients.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  Nebulizer products required by LSA-West (at a minimum) are nebulizer systems, adapters, mouthpieces, masks, tubing, standard connectors which preferably are latex-free, anti-static, and shatter resistant.  These items are used to administer physician-prescribed inhalation solutions to asthmatic patients.  NOTE:  Vendors:  Please state that you can provide a complete product line and provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.).  In addition, send any applicable product literature in response to this RFQ.<BR>2. Vendors must have a DAPA, or be in the process of applying for a DAPA, for the Nebulizer Product Line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3. Vendors must have a separate agreement with LSA-Wests Prime Vendor (currently, Cardinal Health is the PV for distribution in LSA-West.)  Please provide documentation of your companys agreement with Prime Vendor.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Regional PV will be disqualified.)<BR>4. Vendors must offer volume discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. Vendors that fail to offer a discount off the DAPA price will be disqualified.<BR>5. Vendors must have a local vendor representative in the Northwest Region, Southwest Region & Pacific Region that can provide assistance at regional facility locations.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.<BR>6. Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for items in their nebulizer product line, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  <BR>a. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  <BR>b. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.<BR>c. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.  Additionally, the Government will not contact any points of contact that are provided in response to this question.<BR>7. Nebulizers that deliver drugs via conventional continuous emission are required.  Please state that your product line includes nebulizers with this feature.<BR>8. Please state yes or no to the following required features and explain how your companys products satisfy each of the following characteristics for nebulizers:<BR>a. Product has breath actuated technology<BR>b. Product is reusable<BR>c. Product can be disinfected. Including for Cystic Fibrosis patients guidelines recommend boiling nebulizers for ten-minutes to disinfect. <BR>d. Product does not heat, degrade or shear medications.<BR>e. Product provides comfortable, fine mist of medication.<BR>f. Product is manufactured with durable, shatter-resistant, anti-static, latex-free materials.<BR>g. Product air dries after cleaning (i.e. no manual drying of product necessary). <BR>h. Product can be supplied with optional latex-free mask attachment for use with infants and children.<BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Price Analysis Process: Vendors determined to be acceptable based upon evaluation of their Technical/Company Criteria response will be asked to provide samples and their price discount quotes. The request for samples (see the sample set identified below and that appears in the FBO) will be concurrent with the request for price discount quotes (which will include the vendors full product line)<BR><BR>1. In the pre-source selection procedures above, the CPT developed a list of items from the product group to evaluate. The determination of the sample set was based on advances in technology, patient safety, and on historical usage for the product line. The CPT also determined that the clinical/performance evaluation will be performed in a non-clinical setting.  <BR><BR>2. The following procedures will apply: <BR><BR>a. The TRBO office will request a no charge clinical evaluation sample set from each of the vendors with a required delivery date 30 days from date of request. <BR>b. Each vendor will send the samples directly to the participating MTFs at the addresses listed at the end of this announcement. <BR>c. All email communications between vendors and the LSA-West concerning sample set shipment will be digitally signed.<BR>d. Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arrival will be disqualified from the standardization process.<BR>e. Due to the potential for samples to become lost or delayed in shipping, all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor, and anticipated delivery date. <BR><BR> The samples to be provided are as follows:          <BR><BR>Nebulizer system (Latex-free, anti-static, shatter resistant):  Quantity (5)<BR>Optional mask infant size:  Quantity (5)<BR>Optional mask pediatric size:  Quantity (5)<BR>Optional mask adult size:  Quantity (5)<BR><BR>3. The CPTs will evaluate each product against the clinical/performance criteria. All criteria will carry equal weight.  The evaluations will take place in a clinical setting.  <BR><BR>4. The evaluation responses will represent a clinical value judgment placed in a Likert-like scale with a 1 to 5 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree or no; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree or yes; 5 = Strongly Agree).  Comments will be invited and recorded on the evaluations.<BR><BR>5. The CPTs have set a clinical acceptability threshold target at 3.1.  The CPTs will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative  at or near 3.1  depending on the location of any break (or gap) in vendors average scores.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.1 in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT developed, validated, and approved the following equally weighted clinical/performance criteria.  Criteria will be evaluated one time in a non-clinical setting by at least one clinical product team member at each participating facility.<BR><BR>1. Clear, easy to follow instructions are provided for assembly (if applicable) and operation of the product. <BR>a. Rationale:  Due to our beneficiaries varying educational levels and products that are used in both home and  medical treatment facility environments, the LSA-West requires clear, and easy to follow instructions for proper assembly and operation of devices.<BR>b. Evaluators will read the insert provided with the product and evaluate whether instructions are clear and easy to follow.<BR><BR>2. Product can be easily cleaned/maintained and disinfected in a home environment.<BR>a. Rationale:  Due to varying home and field training environments of our patient   beneficiary population, the LSA-West requires products that can be easily cleaned and maintained.<BR>b. Evaluators will read cleaning/maintenance instructions accompanying the product and evaluate whether products can be cleaned/maintained in unique military settings.  <BR><BR><BR>Pricing Analysis:  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be asked to provide their price discount quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total LSA West Regional requirement concurrent with product sample request.<BR><BR>1. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the LSA West Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (PST), fourteen (14) calendar days or as described after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.  The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements. <BR><BR>2. The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  <BR>a. Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);<BR>b. Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   <BR>c. Impact of Unmatched Lines [i.e., unmatched lines require the Region to either substitute a less than optimal item or pay DAPA or possibly open market prices to obtain the item]; and<BR>d. Consideration of SKUs by each vendor intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>3. Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR><BR>4. Vendors will forward pricing to the Lead TRBO, and the Lead TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the individual Region TPRB.  Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<BR><BR>5. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.<BR><BR>6. The individual Regions TPRB reviews the data to support a selection of the best-value, lowest-overall-cost quote. The individual Regions TPRB votes for the best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative for a single vendor selection.  The DSLs review the basis for the selection and approves the selection.<BR><BR><BR>Rules of Engagement: <BR><BR>a. Standardization Evaluations will be conducted in areas designated by the TRBO.<BR>b. Clinicians will use an evaluation tool, which will be collected by the TRBO.<BR>c. CPT members can have no invested personal interest in the outcome in a standardization effort. <BR>d. CPT members will be familiar with the specific guidelines for accepting gifts and incentive type items from vendors.  Any violations of the guidelines will be reported to the appropriate officials.  <BR>e. The TRBO will perform statistical analysis of data obtained from the evaluations.<BR>f. Vendors will deliver products to designated location and specified time as agreed upon by the vendors and the TRBO.<BR>g. Vendors presence will not be required during this evaluation.<BR>h. When participating in a standardization effort, vendors must contact the TRBO prior to contacting any clinical personnel in reference to the product being considered for standardization. <BR>i. Additional education or training on the selected products will be at the vendors expense. <BR>j. All evaluation methods will have a start and stop date set by the CPT that will be strictly enforced.  <BR>k. The government is not responsible for cost of sample items, shipping of these items, or any costs associated with the clinical evaluations.<BR>l. Only products selected by the CPT will be reviewed during an evaluation.  All other products presented during the evaluation will be rejected.<BR>m. Unless specifically requested by the TRBO, NO COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD SPEAK TO ANY HOSPITAL STAFF MEMBER OR TPRB MEMBER REGARDING PRICE OR PRICE-RELATED FACTORS.<BR>Failure to comply with any of the rules of engagement described above may result in disqualification of your company from further consideration.  Please do not hesitate to contact our Clinical Analyst at 253-968-0898 for questions.<BR><BR>

<p>TOFS-10-S-0003</p>
<p>This is a sources sought notice. This announcement is for market research and preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted in response to this notice. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow up information requests.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Financial Stability (OFS) is responsible for the management and administration of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) which was established under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (Act). The purpose of the Act is to provide the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) with the authorities and facilities to restore liquidity and stability to the financial system of the United States. In addition, the Secretary is directed to ensure that such authorities are used in a manner that protects home values, college funds, retirement accounts, and life savings; preserves homeownership and promotes jobs and economic growth; maximizes overall returns to the taxpayers of the United States; and provides public accountability for the exercise of such authority. By acquiring, managing, and orderly liquidating the troubled assets over time, the Treasury seeks to improve the capital positions of financial institutions, reduce risk premiums in the market, improve liquidity and credit extension in the financial system, increase investor confidence, and provide market participants with more price transparency. The portfolio mandate and specific investment strategies may change over time but will always be consistent with these policy goals.</p>
<p>The operational goals of OFS are to:</p>
<p>1. Ensure the overall stability and liquidity of the financial system.<br />2. Prevent avoidable foreclosures and help preserve homeownership.<br />3. Protect taxpayer interests.<br />4. Promote transparency.</p>
<p>OFS administers loans, guarantees, equity investments, and other payments in the following programs:</p>

<p>Credit Reform Modeling - Expertise with modeling support, and financial and statistical analysis of equity, direct loan, and loan guaranty programs. The focus is on developing and maintaining cost models and estimates that are consistent with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.

<p>The purpose of this sources sought notice is to gain knowledge of the interest, capabilities, and qualifications of prospective offerors in support of the financial service areas described above. Treasury is particularly interested in understanding the capabilities and qualifications of interested small business concerns, including woman and minority owned small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB). Treasury's choice of solicitation vehicle and acquisition strategy will depend in part upon the responses to this notice of all firms, including small businesses.</p>
<p>Interested vendors are requested to provide a written response to this notice which is limited to a maximum of 11 pages with a minimum font size of 10 point, one page covering all information necessary to address items 1 - 4 below, and one page per each of the ten categories (items 5 and 6 below). For example: If responding to five categories, vendor's response is then limited to six pages total. The response should reference the following items:</p>
<p>1) The vendor's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address; <br />2) The vendor's small business size status, including whether the vendor is a woman owned, minority owned, or SDVOSB firm; <br />3) A statement indicating if vendor is currently a GSA Schedule holder, and, if so, identification of GSA contract number and corresponding schedule identification number.<br />4) A statement as to whether the firm is interested in working as a prime contractor or a subcontractor*; <br />5) A statement indicating which of the ten categories the firm is interested in proposing; and,<br />6) A description of the vendor's capabilities and timeframe of latest experience under each category the firm expresses interest.</p>
<p>* Please Note: Treasury will maintain a list of any firm that represents that it has an interest in being a subcontractor or part of a teaming arrangement for purposes of the contemplated procurement. Treasury intends to provide such a list to any prospective offeror upon request. As a result, any firm that responds to this sources sought notice should indicate whether it consents to its inclusion on such a publicly-available list. The list may be posted at the government point-of-entry (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/).</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541611. The small business size standard, based upon the NAICS code, is $7,000,000.</p>
<p>Treasury anticipates that the forthcoming solicitation will require offerors to provide information on the capabilities of their firms, and their key personnel, resources, past performance, and labor rates offered for each category on which they would like to propose. All firms will be required to propose an organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) mitigation plan. Treasury expects to award contracts to the combination of firms which represent the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Treasury plans to host an industry day in February, 2010, prior to solicitation release. Treasury plans to solicit offers in the March - April 2010 timeframe for the subsequent award of multiple contract vehicles covering all categories referenced above, while offering a best value to Treasury. Treasury anticipates a benefit from multiple awards as a result of increased competition for known task work or evolving needs, increased small business participation, and mitigation of possible conflicts. OFS anticipates needing ongoing support with current and future programs; thus, the resultant contract awards shall be issued for a performance period of up to five (5) years.</p>
<p>Treasury intends to continue to post additional information in regards to requirements and evaluation factors, on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fedbizopps.gov) as it becomes known.</p>
<p>Interested prospective offerors must respond to this sources sought notice no later than 2:00 P.M. ET on December 4, 2009.

<SUBJECT>Replacement Hydraulic Component Test Stand
<SOLNBR>N68335-10-RFI-0051
<RESPDATE>122809
<CONTACT>Gianna V Gatto, Phone (732) 323-1270, Email gianna.gatto@navy.mil
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst is requesting information pertaining to the replacement of the existing A/F27T-10 Hydraulic Component Test Stand.  The USN and USMC currently use A/F27T-10 Hydraulic Component Test Stand (T-10 HCTS) at all land based as well as ship board and Marine Corps mobile maintenance facilities (MF) based Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Departments. The HCTS provides hydraulic electrical and pneumatic power, instrumentation and controls necessary for diagnostic testing and functional acceptance of aircraft hydraulic and pneumatic components. 

The new ‘family’ of equipment will replace all A/F27T-10 HCTSs procured in the mid 1990s. To employ lessons learned from that acquisition, the new unit will vary based on operational environment and types of aircraft supported but will be as similar as possible in design, internal components and operation to minimize the life-cycle logistics. The Navy envisions a test stand that will be modular in design with each activity getting a general purpose hydraulic component test console and a control console.  Selected activities will also be outfitted with UUT specific consoles (such as one for pump and motor testing) depending on aircraft and location. These consoles will provide the unit-under-test (UUT) with all necessary input test parameters to perform the functional tests through the use of hydraulic and electrical adapters. In addition the contractor will be providing a heat exchanger that will be used to cool the hydraulic fluid when facility services are not available, e.g. USMC MF.

Nominal requirements for the replacement test stand are: 

Fluid Temperature: Adjustable between 90deg F and 160 deg F; Dynamic Test Circuit Capability: 30 gpm at 6,000 psig, 40 gpm at 5,000 psig, 60 gpm at 3,000 psig (all max); Low Pressure Test Circuit: 0-250 psi; Hydraulic Static Pressure Circuit: Maximum hydrostatic pressure of 10,000 psig; Pneumatic Static Pressure Circuit: Max pneumatic static pressure of 6,000 psig; Pump and Motor Capability: Able to interface/run a pump and/or motor in an additional chamber driving hydraulic pumps from 0 to 10,000 RPM, 300 horsepower, measure and display output torque of hydraulic motors in the range of 0 to 2500 in-lbs.

The purpose of the request for information is to identify potential contractors and to gain insight into current commercial product and/or component test stands built for other DOD activities. Along with the interest and product information, it is requested that following topics be addressed:

1. Automation advantages/disadvantages
2. ILS integration into design process
3. Operational environment of current products
4. Design process including use of modeling, drawing practices etc
5. Approach to/experience with modular design
6. Information that quantifies the reliability and maintainability parameters for current products including built in test, time to conduct scheduled maintenance
7. Estimated price information for projected unit costs.

It is requested that information be submitted NO LATER THAN 28 December 2009 to Ms. Gianna Gatto, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25212 B562-3, Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082, or by electronic mail at: gianna.gatto@navy.mil. Ms. Gatto may be reached at (732) 323-1270 or fax (732) 323-2359, or to Ms. Lori Bishop, by electronic mail at: lori.bishop@navy.mil, who may be reached at (732) 323-4771 or fax (732) 323-2359. Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation MAY NOT necessarily result from the RFI. Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation. The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this RFI nor will the Government compensate any respondent with costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Thermo Environmental Instruments, Inc., 27 Forge Parkway,  Franklin, MA 02038 for the acquisition of a Partisol Plus 2025 Sequential PM 10-2.5 Federal Reference Method (FRM) Air Sampler Pair.
There is a need for a pilot study that will ultimately develop the standardized procedures for long-term speciation monitoring in the United States.  The study requires the use of Federal Reference Methods (FRMs) for PM 10-2.5.  In addition, the use of a sequential sampler operation to minimize the burden on the state/local monitoring agencies that are collecting samples for the study is also required.  Sequential operation allows the monitoring agency to visit the site less frequently.  Currently, the only approved FRM that operates sequentially for PM10-2.5 is the Thermo Partisol 2025 Sampler Pair.  The Thermo 2025 Sequential Air Sampler pair has been used previously by ORD in several field studies of PM 10-2.5 mass and speciation and procurement of the same sampler type for the study provides the necessary consistency.  
EPA believes Thermo Environmental is the only vendor capable of satisfying the Agency's requirements.  The circumstances permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements."  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exists and, therefore, no RFP is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide a capability statement but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will not be honored.  All interested parties must respond by 12:00pm EST November 27, 2009 to Lanelle T. Shands, at the following address: shands.lanelle@epa.gov.  
Interested vendors shall:  1) include information on the proposed services/equipment which clearly supports the requirements outlined above; 2) fully explain your capabilities and qualifications and; 3) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  Responses to this synopsis must be made in writing.  No telephone or fax requests will be honored.

Title
Development of Experimental Facture Mechanics Data for Complex Shaped Flaws in Dissimilar Metal Welds.

 
This is a sources sought synopsis.  This notice does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is the government obligated to issue an RFP.  The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting a market survey and analysis to determine the range of available contractors that exists and assess their capabilities to assist the NRC. The purpose of this announcement is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of conflict of interest (COI). For information on NRC COI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5 (www.nrc.gov/who-we-are/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html). All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses) are invited to submit a response.  The capabilities package submitted by a vendor should demonstrate the firm's ability, capability, and responsibility to perform the principal components of work listed below.  The package should also include past performance/experience regarding projects of similar scope listing the project title, general description, the dollar value of the contract, and name of the company, agency, or government entity for which the work was performed.  Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures or videos is discouraged. Responses are due no later than December 4, 2009.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information.  Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable.  Facsimile (301-492-3437) or email (Michele.Sharpe@nrc.gov) responses are acceptable or responses may be mailed to: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Michele D. Sharpe, Division of Contracts, Mail Stop TWB-01-B10M, Washington, DC 20555.     

It is not NRC's intent to publicly disclose any vendor proprietary information obtained during this sources sought notice. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the FOIA and other laws and regulations, information identified by a Respondent as "proprietary" or "confidential" will be kept confidential; however, the Government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this sources sought notice.  It is emphasized that this notice is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as any commitment by the Government.  Due to a variety of limitations, the NRC does not plan to entertain questions related to the substance of this sources sought notice.  Pre-solicitation and/or pre-proposal conferences may be held, pending the level of interest.  

Responses should be submitted in MS Word and/or MS Excel format and include the following information:

1) Organization Name;
2) Organization web address;
3) A brief overview of your organization. 
4) Primary contact name having authority and knowledge to discuss your sources sought responses with Government representatives;
5) Primary contact phone;
6) Primary contact e-mail;


Brief Description of Requirement:

The NRC’s Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) is responsible for providing technical advice, technical tools and information for identifying and resolving safety issues, making regulatory decisions, and promulgating regulations and guidance.  RES conducts independent experiments and analyses, develops technical bases for supporting realistic safety decisions by the agency, and prepares the agency for the future by evaluating safety issues involving current and new designs and technologies.

NRC Standard Review Plan (SRP) 3.6.3 describes Leak-Before-Break (LBB) assessment methodologies that are acceptable to NRC.  Specifically, it describes a deterministic assessment procedure that can be used to demonstrate compliance with the 10CFR50 Appendix A, General Design Requirement (GDC) 4 requirement that the primary system pressure piping exhibit an extremely low probability of rupture (xLPR).  However, SRP 3.6.3 does not allow for assessment of piping system with active degradation mechanisms and it does not comprehensively address uncertainties.  NRC seeks assistance in obtaining experimental data on the stability characteristics of complex-shaped flaws in dissimilar metal (DM) welds.  These experimental results will be used to determine if the current analysis methodologies can be used to predict the load-carrying capacity of such pipe.

The program manager, key personnel, and any other senior technical staff that will be performing work shall have expertise, experience, and/or education in the following key areas:

a)  Expertise in conducting large pipe fracture experiments with and without internal pressure;
b)  Expertise at selecting and implementing complex instrumentation for pipe fracture experiments;
c)  Expertise in mechanical properties testing and measurement techniques;
d)  Expertise in developing piping fracture mechanics codes;
e)  Expertise in finite element analyses;
f)   Detailed knowledge of DM weld fabrication methods;
g)  Detailed knowledge of past NRC nuclear pipe fracture mechanics programs;
h)  Knowledge of NRC regulatory process as it relates to DM weld cracking.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Water Resources Division, Minnesota District, Contributions of EACs from WWTP and upstream sources research project, has a requirement for laboratory analyses. The analyses include measurement of standardized (calibrated) estrogenicity activity levels in water and sediment samples. These assays are required for analyzing water as part of our integrated environmental chemistry/biology research project. In particular, these assays are critical to establish the potential biological responses in fish. These laboratory assays are critical biological endpoints for determination of the relation of chemical exposure and biological response. The total estrogenicity of the environmental samples will be measured using an estrogen receptor transcriptional assay (T47D-KBluc gene expression assay). This assay can quantify hormonal activity of the environmental samples based on their ability to bind to the steroid receptor and to induce and attenuate downstream responses.
Based on information available at this time, the government considers the item specified as a sole source from The University of St. Thomas, Department of Biology, 2115 Summit Avenue, Mail OWS 390, St. Paul, MN 55105-1080 and proposes to negotiate with that firm only.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and provide considerable cost savings are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required item stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered a non-response to this request without further consideration.  Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business December 3, 2009 by 3:00 P.M. Mountain Standard Time.  This notice represents the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the regions based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value.  It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a clinically preferred product and source at the best possible price.   It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program. As a clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical criteria plus meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration.<BR><BR>The major Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Pacific Region, TRBO Region 12 area include but are not limited to Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, MEDDAC-K Seoul, 374th Medical Group Yokota Air Base, 18th Medical Group Kadena Air Base.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is January 2010. The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Mary Summers, TRBO Technical Director<BR>808-433-3686, mary.summers1@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.

The region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submission/quote, without discussion. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. The Region reserves the right to reject all quotes and cancel the RFQRIA if it is determined to be in the governments best interest.<BR><BR>Price will be analyzed based on the vendors anticipated Post Standardization Costs. Post standardization costs will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the region. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post Standardization Cost at the current suppliers non-discounted price. Among the products and sources that are determined to be clinically preferred, the best price (Post Standardization Cost) will be the deciding factor. <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process and program. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) within the Pacific Region. The board is chaired by the Designated Senior Logistician (DSL) and Co-Chaired by a physician and nurse from the Naval Hospital Yokosuka and the Hawaii Multi Service Marketing Management Office, respectively. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>Technical  Criteria Evaluations:  Due to the potential for email to be lost in<BR>transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM HST on the date listed for closing will be disqualified.  <BR><BR>The vendors responses to the technical criteria will be reviewed for acceptability.  Acceptability is defined as follows: 1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the vendor can meet the standard of each technical criterion; 2.) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community that are applicable to such products or services; and 3) the information provided by the vendor is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  Failure to provide any requested information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. Vendors must achieve an acceptable rating on their responses to the technical criteria for continued consideration in this initiative.  Vendors who do not achieve an acceptable rating will be disqualified.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria<BR>1. Vendors must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of Advanced Wound Care. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes the following products in the following sizes: <BR>	Hydrocolloid Dressing<BR>4X4 Regular thickness<BR>4X4 Extra-Thin<BR><BR>Silver Dressings<BR>10X12 <BR>1X12 Strips<BR><BR>Foam Dressings<BR>5X5 Adhesive<BR>5X5 Non-Adhesive <BR><BR>Moisture Vapor Permeable Film<BR>5  X4 Framed<BR>5  X4 Unframed<BR><BR>2. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for Advanced Wound Care. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. Vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.<BR><BR>3. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. Vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.<BR><BR>4. At a minimum, vendors must provide a standard industry warranty and submit evidence of their policy with their initial submittals.<BR><BR>5. Products must be in packaging that can be delivered to a sterile field. <BR><BR>6. Vendors must identify the educational tools or materials which are available for this product line.  <BR><BR>7. Products must be latex free and be clearly labeled as such on all exterior and interior packaging including the individual items. <BR><BR>8. Vendors must provide an electronic copy of their clinical application/product recommendation chart.  Please include one copy in an electronic form such as a PDF file. <BR><BR><BR><BR>Clinical Performance Evaluation:<BR>Specific Clinical Product Teams (CPTs), which consist of physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, and technicians from the participating MTFs, will evaluate the clinical performance of product samples based on the evaluation criteria below.   Each criterion is of equal weight.  The evaluation responses will be in a Likert type scale with a 1-5 scoring range. The scale descriptors are: One (1) = Strongly Disagree; Two (2) = Disagree; Three (3) = Neutral; Four (4) = Agree; and Five (5) = Strongly Agree. <BR>Clinical evaluations will be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  The clinical performance criteria for this initiative are:<BR>   <BR><BR>  <BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria <BR>Hydrocolloid:<BR>1.

This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Pacific Region. The board is chaired by the Designated Senior Logistician (DSL). They are the deciding officials for this initiative. The Pacific Region TPRB is Co-Chaired by a physician from Naval Hospital Yokosuka and an Air Force Nurse Corps officer assigned to the Hawaii Multi-Service Marketing Management Office (MSMMO). The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussion. <BR><BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:<BR>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted technical/company criteria outline below:<BR>1.	Vendors must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of Basic Urologicals -  Urinary Catheters.  A complete line of product is defined as the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes the following products in the following sizes:<BR>1) Pediatric antimicrobial Foley Catheter in sizes: 6Fr (Balloon size 1.5cc), 8Fr (Balloon size 3cc) and 10Fr (Balloon size 3cc); <BR>2) Catheters 12 Fr to 24 Fr (Balloon size 5cc); Catheters 16 Fr to 24 Fr (Balloon size 30cc).  <BR>2.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for 	Basic Urological - Urinary Catheters. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the 	application process with the initial submittal. Vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a 	lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.<BR>3.   Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor Cardinal Health for 	distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. 	Vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.<BR>4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this <BR>	standardization initiative. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are <BR>	required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, <BR>	FSS prices do not represent a discount off DAPA. <BR><BR>5.	Vendors must provide latex free Basic Urologicals  Urinary Catheters. <BR><BR>6.	Vendors must provide Foley catheters which have an antimicrobial property. <BR><BR>7.	Vendor must provide a full description of the nature/components of their respective <BR>	antimicrobial properties for the Foley catheters. <BR><BR>8.   Vendor must provide a sterile packaging which clearly shows the expiration date of the catheter. <BR><BR>9.  Vendor must provide the information on the location of the Latex Free disclosure, whether it is on the individual packaging or on the shipping/storage box. <BR><BR>10. Vendor must provide package labeling which clearly shows the size (French), length and balloon size of the contents. <BR><BR>11. Vendor must provide individually packaged sterile Foley catheters. <BR><BR>12. Vendor must provide individually packaged sterile straight urinary catheters. <BR><BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<BR>1. Packaging opens easily, without tearing of any edges and allows for presentation on to a sterile field. (Packaging which tears or heat-sealed edges separate unevenly will contaminate both the catheter and the sterile field.) Addresses patient safety  infection control  and cost.<BR>        a. The tabs for opening the package separate easily and provide an even separation of <BR>        the heat sealed edges. <BR>        b. This criterion will be evaluated  by the clinician performing the actual <BR>        opening of the package and the placement of the catheter.   <BR>        c. The evaluators will carefully open the packaging, using the tabs at the end and <BR>        separate the package. The expectation is that the package heat sealed edges will separate <BR>        evenly and the catheter can be placed without contamination of the catheter or the sterile <BR>        field. <BR><BR>2.   The surfaces of the catheter are smooth, without areas of uneven distribution of the <BR>	catheter material.(Uneven distribution of the catheter material will be abrasive to the <BR>	sensitive skin of the urethra and cause pain and potential for bleeding) Addresses patient <BR>	safety and comfort. <BR>    a.   The catheter will be smooth. <BR>    b.   This criterion will be evaluated by each clinician carefully examining, both<BR>          visually and with tactile inspection, for overall smoothness and the lack of poor <BR>          distribution of the material.<BR>    c.   The expectation is that the catheter will be smooth. <BR><BR>       3.  The inflatable balloon ring segment is attached securely and is embedded in the catheter,<BR>avoiding a large bump. (A raised area, caused by the inflatable balloon ring segment can <BR>be abrasive to the urethral mucous membrane and cause bleeding and pain) Addresses <BR>patient safety and comfort. <BR>    a.   The inflatable ring segment is embedded in the catheter without causing a bump. <BR>    b.   This criterion will be evaluated by each clinician carefully examining, both visually  <BR>          and with tactile inspection, the inflatable balloon ring segment for any raised <BR>          bumpy areas.<BR>    c.   The expectation is that the inflatable balloon ring segment is embedded in the <BR>          catheter to avoid a potential traumatic raised bumpy area.<BR><BR>4. The inflatable balloon inflates evenly and remains inflated after removing the balloon <BR>inflating syringe. (Cuff must inflate evenly to provide complete sealing of the opening from the bladder to the urethra  otherwise urine will leak around the catheter) Addresses patient comfort, patient safety and infection control. <BR>a. Cuff will clearly inflate in an even circumferential fashion and will remain inflated after inflation syringe is removed.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by each clinician using the inflating syringe, inflating the balloon and removing the syringe. The balloon will be visually and tactile inspected for even inflation and for remaining inflated.   <BR> c. The expectation is that the cuff will evenly, and in a circumferential manner,  <BR>     inflate and remain inflated after removing syringe<BR><BR>5. The inflatable balloon deflates completely and evenly when the solution is extracted <BR>using the syringe via the balloon inflation tail of the catheter. (A balloon cuff is required <BR>to deflate evenly to avoid the bunching of material which could abrade the mucous <BR>membrane when withdrawing the catheter) Addresses patient safety and comfort.<BR>a. Cuff will deflate completely and evenly. <BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by each clinician using the syringe into the balloon activation tail of the catheter, withdrawing the solution and observing, both visually and with tactile inspection, the deflated balloon. <BR>                        c. The expectation is that the cuff will evenly and completely deflate around the <BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the regions based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program.  As a clinically driven program, products will be selected based on their ability to meet the clinical evaluation expectations as a primary consideration. Price is the second factor in the decision and should demonstrate cost containment, cost avoidance and/or cost savings.<BR><BR>The major Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Pacific Region, TRBO Region 12 area  include, but are not limited to Tripler Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Okinawa,  Naval Hospital Guam,  Naval Hospital Yokosuka, and 374th MDG Yokota Air Base Japan, MEDDAC-K Seoul, and the 18th MDG Kadena Air Base. <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is January 2010.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Mary Summers, TRBO Team Leader<BR>808-433-3686, mary.summers1@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.

This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Pacific Region. The board is chaired by the Designated Senior Logistician (DSL). They are the deciding officials for this initiative. The Pacific Region TPRB is Co-Chaired by a physician from Naval Hospital Yokosuka and an Air Force Nurse Corps officer assigned to the Hawaii Multi-Service Marketing Management Office (MSMMO). The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussion. <BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria<BR>1.	Vendors must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of Basic Urologicals -  Foley Tray W/Bag & Urimeter. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.

Vendor must provide a closed system which has the Foley catheter securely attached to the drainage tubing and to the urine drainage bag and urimeter. <BR>11.	Vendor must provide an insertion tray which clearly displays the expiration date.<BR>12.	Vendor must provide an insertion tray which clearly describes/lists the contents.   <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria <BR>1.	The contents of the Foley Insertion Tray will be arranged in order of usage by the clinician. (It is critical to efficiency of time that the contents are layered in order of use. This is an accepted and consistent standard of practice.) Addresses issues of patient safety and comfort and procedure time. <BR>a.	The items are configured/layered correctly and in accordance with step-by-step use by the clinician. <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by the clinicians within the six (6) MTFs performing the evaluations. <BR>c.	The evaluators will carefully examine the contents of the procedure tray. The expectation is that the Foley insertion tray will be configured in order of use. <BR><BR>2.	The Foley Catheter Insertion Tray contains a securely attached closed system of the Foley catheter, drainage tubing and urinary drainage bag W/Urine meter. (It is critical to prevent Urinary Tract Infections by having a closed system when inserting a Foley catheter) Addresses patient safety and the avoidance of contamination  supports the prevention of Hospital Acquired Urinary Tract Infections. <BR>a.	The components of the closed system  the Foley Catheter, the tubing, the drainage bag W/Urine Meter  are securely attached and do not become detached/separated during inspection.  <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by the clinicians within the six (6) MTFs performing the evaluations.<BR>c.	The expectation is that the components (Foley catheter, drainage tubing and urinary collection bag W/Urine Meter) will be securely attached.  <BR><BR>3.	The outer packaging is durable and intact. (Maintain sterilization of contents, maintain integrity of materials, and eliminate the potential for degradation of materials). Addresses both patient safety and cost.<BR>a.	The outside wrapping is free of holes, punctures, splits in the heat sealed edges and tears anywhere.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by the clinicians within the six (6) MTFs performing the evaluations.  <BR>c.	The evaluators will carefully inspect all three dimension of the outer packaging for any punctures, tears, or compromise to the heat-sealed edges. The expectation is that no such compromise to the protection of the contents will be found. <BR><BR>      4. The internal components will be free of damage: punctures, tearing, or crushing. (Evidence <BR> 	of tampering, crushing, moisture intrusion, and a break in the sterile wrapping would <BR>	make the entire catheter insertion tray unusable and is mandated to be destroyed) <BR>	Addresses patient safety, cost effectiveness, and issues of contamination. An item is <BR>	either sterile or unsterile.<BR>	      a.   No item within the protective outer wrap is found to be damaged.<BR>	      b.   This criterion will be evaluated by the clinicians within the six (6) MTFs <BR>		performing the evaluations. <BR>	      c. 	Upon breaking the seal of the outer shipping wrapper, each item is examined for <BR>		any damage, any moisture intrusion, or any breakage of items. The expectation is <BR>		that no breakage or damage is discovered with any item.<BR><BR>	5. The sample port is easily accessed by luer-loc or slip-tip syringe and immediately self <BR>	seals. (The sample port cannot provide an avenue for urine to leak outside the closed <BR>	system and provide the opportunity for infection/contamination.) Addresses patient safety <BR>	and the risk of a Hospital Acquired Urinary Tract Infection; and, a break in the closed <BR>	system requiring the replacement of the tubing, the urinary drainage bag and urine meter.<BR>		a. The sample port is easily accessed via a luer-loc or slip-tip syringe and self <BR>		seals immediately.<BR>		b. This criterion will be evaluated by the clinicians within the six (6) MTFs <BR>		performing the evaluations. <BR>		c. Upon accessing the sample port with either a slip-tip or luer-loc syringe, the<BR> sample port will self seal. The expectation is that no urine leaks from the sample <BR> port.<BR><BR>	6. The urine drainage tubing and the connection to the urine drainage bag are configured <BR>	to prevent the return of urine (anti reflux) to the tubing.  (The tubing and the connection <BR>	to the urinary drainage bag are configured in such a way as to prevent the return of urine <BR>	to the tubing (reflux) and contribute to an infection.) Addresses patient safety and the risk <BR>	of a Hospital Acquired Urinary Tract Infection.<BR>		a. The tubing and the connection to the urinary drainage bag are configured to <BR>		avoid urinary reflux.<BR>		b. This criterion will be evaluated by the clinicians within the six (6) MTFs <BR>		performing the evaluations. <BR>		c.  The  expectation is that the urine will not return to the tubing and contaminate <BR>		the down stream urine.<BR><BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT Mike Tierney, (706) 787-2093, Michael.tierney1@us.army.mil.   65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>The Southeast (Reg. 3 & 4) and Northeast (Reg. 1) Regions, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 93 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of MANUAL RESUSCITATION BAGS. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across Southeast and Northeast regions based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in this multi-regional initiative include: Southeast Region - Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Commuity Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS), the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  Northeast Region - Walter Reed Army Medical Center (Washington, DC), National Naval Medical Center (Bethesda, MD), Malcolm Grow Medical Center (Andrews AFB, MD), Dewitt Healthcare System (FT Belvoir, VA), Keller Army Community Hospital (WestPoint, NY), and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center (FT Meade, MD).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The Southeast Region has been designated as the Lead TRBO for this standardization action.  The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is March 2010.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best Value/trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Southeast and Northeast region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<BR> Point of Contact: Michael Tierney, (706)787-2093, Michael.tierney1@us.army.mil <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Region are seeking product line items in the category of MANUAL RESUSCITATION BAGS, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within the Southeast and Northeast region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $101,618.00.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast and Northeast regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Michael Tierney, (706)787-2093, Michael.tierney1@us.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Southeast region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Southeast Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Lead TRBO Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Regions Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast and Northeast region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Regions intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southeast and Northeast region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to Michael.tierney1@us.army.mil by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified / invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor. <BR>In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of disposable/single use Manual Resuscitation Bags with configuration options.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.<BR>a. At a minimum the vendor must provide the following:  Disposable /single use Manual Resuscitation Bags with configuration options available in a range of bag volume sizes (adult, pediatrics and infant).  Adult Resuscitation Bags must be provided fully assembled (non re-breathing valve, self-inflating bag, swivel patient adapter and mask), Pediatric disposable resuscitation bags must be fully assembled (non re-breathing valve, self inflating pediatric volume bag, swivel patient adapter and pediatric mask), Infant manual resuscitation bag must be fully assembled (non re-breathing valve, self-inflating infant volume bag with infant size mask) and available configuration options for each size  (oxygen tubing, reservoir bag, disposable manometer, pressure relief valve, adjustable peep valve).<BR>b.

Vendor MUST have a DAPA for Manual Resuscitation Bag product line.  Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>4.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the Prime Vendor (PV) (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor for the Southeast and Northeast Regions) for Manual Resuscitation Bags in the Regions.   (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I).  Vendor MUST provide supporting documentation (four digit code) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal. <BR>5.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>6.	Vendor MUST provide Manual Resuscitation Bags that are latex free/safe. Vendor MUST submit documentation on latex status for all items in response to this RFRIAQ Vendors who do not provide documentation to support this in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR><BR>Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Clinical/Performance Evaluations<BR>1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the Lead TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) attention at the participating Medical Treatment Facilities and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the Medical Treatment Facilities by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the Lead TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.  <BR>2.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient care setting using a Likert scale.  A one to five scoring range will be used to rate the sample products.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.<BR>3.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for seven (7) calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).<BR>4.	To determine acceptability, the Clinical Product Team (CPT), comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast and Northeast Regions will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a clinical patient care setting. <BR>    <BR>The following Clinical /Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR>1.	(American Heart Association Guideline-Provider must avoid fatigue to avoid poor CPR results) Manual Resuscitation Bag is light weight.<BR>a.	Light weight bag reduces user fatigue.  <BR>b.	Evaluator will perform bag compressions observing the pressure needed to compress the bag and support needed to manage the bag.  <BR>2.	(American Heart Association Guidelines-Manual adult ventilations should be performed at 12 breaths per minute) Resuscitation Bag is self-inflating.<BR>a.	Self-inflating allows required ventilation per minute.  Resuscitation bag does not require compressed oxygen to provide adequate mechanical ventilation.<BR>b.	Evaluator will observe resuscitation bags ability to refill timely after each compression.<BR>3.	(American Heart Association Guideline-Resuscitation Bag must be compressed firmly with one-hand to delivery adequate tidal volume that cause patients chest to rise) Bag design allows one-handed grip.    <BR>a.

Evaluator will observe chest rise with compressions which indicate adequate tidal volume is being delivered. Evaluator will maintain visual observation of the patients face for skin color changes or vomiting during CPR.      <BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process:  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast and Northeast Region combined.  Pricing must be received at the Lead TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Southeast and Northeast region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southeast and Northeast Region). <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Southeast and Northeast region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Southeast and Northeast regions, (Post-Standardization Costs).  This is the most important pricing element.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  (4) Potential Cost Avoidance.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 15 DECEMBER 2009 5:00 PM EST.<BR>

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information is to search for qualified vendors capable of meeting the Department of Veterans Affairs requirement for Advanced CPRS Forms in support of the Veterans Hospital Association (VHA) Innovations Program.The VHA electronic medical record, known as the Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA)/Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), has a built-in capability for developing custom electronic forms.  The applications under consideration are all to be based upon an existing Component Object Model (COM) framework for developing and delivering applications to users of the VA's Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS).  CPRS has the capability of being extended by means of COM modules. These are custom programs that enhance and extend the functionality of CPRS.  The Loma Linda VA Healthcare System (LLVAHCS) has developed a versatile and robust framework based upon CPRS's COM technology.  The LLVAHCS CPRS COM Object is a general-purpose CPRS extension that provides us with the ability to enhance CPRS now and in the future without the necessity of deploying additional CPRS COM object DLLs to the workstations throughout the medical center.  We can extend the functionality of the COM object by writing server-side logic that processes client requests and returns content back to the COM object to be displayed to the CPRS user.The four applications to be developed based upon COM technology are VistaForms (iForms), Medication Reconciliation, Automated Clinic Checkout Sheet, and the IntelliNote Diabetes Care Tool.  VistaForms:  The tool used to create custom forms in CPRS is fairly basic, involving a text editor and a list of fields that can be manually added to create a form.  This precludes many users from creating more advanced forms due to the rather primitive tools available for form creation, and thus places the burden for the development of advanced forms on a relatively small number of users and programmers.  The Contractor shall develop a framework for rapidly creating and delivering advanced electronic forms for clinical users within the CPRS environment that would facilitate the continued improvement of electronic clinical documentation in the VA.  The application shall provide a development interface for designing the form interface and implementing business logic within the form.  The application shall also provide a hosting platform for the delivery mechanism of the forms to the clinical user within the CPRS environment. The forms development interface is a standalone application that allows a non-programmer to create forms by means of a drag-and-drop, rapid application development (RAD) interface.  Medication Reconciliation:  Currently, the LLVAHCS uses COM object interface to remind clinicians to perform and document medication reconciliation. Specifically, when a patient is admitted to the hospital, the COM object is initiated at patient selection, requesting completion of medication reconciliation before proceeding further into the patient's record.  The Contractor shall redesign the current COM object medication reconciliation tool to include a medication ordering function.  LLVAHCS COM object would provide a form with a list of pre-admission medications.  At discharge, the discharge pharmacist or clinician can invoke the discharge medication reconciliation COM object that will generate the pre-admission medication list as well as the current inpatient medication list. The clinician or pharmacist will take action on each medication and generate a list of discharge medications.  The COM object-based application will create a discharge medication note as well as a patient-friendly list of discharge medications for the patient.Automated Clinic Checkout Sheet:  The contractor shall develop an application to provide patients with a patient-friendly summary of their outpatient visit or inpatient stay in an efficient and mostly automated manner.  Using COM technology, medication, lab, consult, imaging and text orders in VistA/CPRS would be translated into a readable, patient-friendly instruction sheet.  At the conclusion of an outpatient visit, clinic staff will invoke the COM object through the CPRS templates, a note title or from the CPRS tools menu.  Therefore the discharge instructions will display discharge medications, self-care instructions, patient education, future appointments, orders for imaging tests and other procedures, consults, lab tests and contact information for the patient's primary care physician.IntelliNote Diabetes Care Tool:  The Contractor shall develop IntelliNote as an innovative and unique solution to diabetes care, using COM technology.  The application will incorporate decision support logic that will allow it to provide recommendations to the clinician based upon current clinical guidelines from various sources, including VA guidelines and formularies.  The clinician will take action on the form which will result in the application automatically ordering appropriate labs and exams, medications, and appointments.  This is a request for information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  The NAICS code for this effort is 541512.  The period of performance is expected to be 12 months from date of award.

<DESC>TRUST Proposers' Day Conference
<p>SYNOPSIS<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Tools for Recognizing Useful Signals of Trustworthiness (TRUST) Program on Wednesday, December 16, 2009 in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. This UNCLASSIFIED Conference will be held from 9 am to 4:30 pm at the Hyatt Regency Reston in Reston, Virginia. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on TRUST, to address questions from potential proposers and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.</p>
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS<br />Trust has generally been defined as the willingness to be vulnerable to another party under conditions in which the negative consequences of abuse of that trust far outweigh any potential gain. Trustworthiness, in turn, has been associated with qualities that are related to those who are perceived to be able to be trusted under specific conditions. <br />However, both trust and trustworthiness - as concepts, much less measures - remain highly qualitative and often unproven, frequently defined using simplistic paradigms or "games" that lack construct and ecological validity, and that further suffer from a distinct lack of interdisciplinary collaboration. Trust to an organizational psychologist rarely refers to the same thing as trust to a behavioral economist, or a cognitive neuroscientist, or others. How each of those disciplines tries to measure trust also varies, often using metrics with little or no replication or validation. Without at least some common understanding and measures of interpersonal trust, knowing who is trustworthy under specific conditions may remain more speculative than it might otherwise have to be. <br /><br />The TRUST Program will bring together sensing AND validated protocols to provide tools for assessing trustworthiness. Doing so requires that we first develop scientifically credible protocols, and then identify combinations of sensors that will detect reliable signals of trust in operationally-relevant scenarios. To develop these tools, the program will be divided into two phases:<br />Phase One will sponsor technical and conceptual innovation in developing experimental protocols that can be validated in order to measure, quantify, and assess different kinds of interpersonal trust and trustworthiness across different interactive, ecologically-valid contexts, to include dyadic and small group interactions in situations with high motivation and consequences. Phase one's tools - in this case, different experimental protocols for different contexts - will help bring new rigor, face validity, and construct validity to trust and trustworthiness across a range of different contexts and different interpersonal variables.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Program will use these protocols to develop further tools (including combinations of sensors and software) to detect and amplify our own useful signals in order to more accurately predict trust and trustworthiness in others.<br /><br />Collaborative efforts/teaming among potential performers will be strongly encouraged. It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary with psychology, neuroscience, social sciences (sociology, anthropology), engineering, statistics, behavioral economics, and other disciplines represented, with others as appropriate. IARPA anticipates that universities and companies from around the world will participate in this fascinating area of research. Researchers will be able to publish their findings in publicly-available, academic journals.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm EST December 11, 2009 at https://conference.brtrc.com/trust_pd/Overview.aspx. Directions to the conference facility and other materials are available on the website.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 100 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government issued photo identification to enter the conference. Non-US citizens will be required to submit a visit request form for Foreign Nationals at least 5 business days prior to the conference. The form and submission instructions can be found on the registration website.</p>
<p><br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />Attendees who wish to present organization capabilities for potential teaming opportunities may request to do so by sending an e-mail along with their presentation to DNI-IARPA-BAA-10-03@ugov.gov. Presentations will be limited to 5 minutes with a maximum of 5 slides (MS PowerPoint or PDF format). Opportunities to present will be limited by time and will therefore be on a "first ask" basis. Deadline for requests is close of business (5:00pm EST) December 11, 2009. It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all materials briefed are appropriately marked and approved for presentation by their organization (remember that this is an UNCLASSIFIED conference). The IARPA Program Manager will review and approve all presentations.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA or participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.</p>
<p>Questions concerning conference &amp; registration can be sent to IARPAevents@brtrc.com.</p>
<p>Questions regarding the program can be sent to DNI-IARPA-BAA-10-03@ugov.gov.</p>

The intent of this RFI is to provide the IAE Program Management Office with market research and insight to help assess the capability of available technologies, and the long-term visibility of potential approaches and solutions to acquire a redesign of the Acquisition Career Management System (ACMIS) that will be developed using open source software and coding techniques, along with the ability to host it on any platform that the U.S Government requires. The solution must be able to generate reports which, when combined with data downloaded from OPM, can tell management their human capital current states and plan for future capital needs. The system must accept data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as well as from the Defense Acquisition University (DAU) to incorporate into the reports.&nbsp;</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): Anderson Construction, DACW01-02-C-0006<br><br>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number DACW01-02-C-0006, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Lake Lanier Project, Buford Georgia, awarded to Anderson Construction Company, 58 Crozier Lane, Fort Gaines, Georgia.  The modification will be funded by American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) funds. The modification will increase the level of effort required under the current contract in the existing technical provisions of invasive species control/eradication, debris and refuse removal, hazardous tree removal, and encroachment removal.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) A detailed scope of work cannot be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed cannot be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at each area.  2)  The contractor is responsible for these activities on the approximately 700 miles of shoreline, 38,000 acres of water and 18,000 acres of land outside of the public recreation areas.  3)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during completion.  4)  This contract enables work to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the resources are impacted.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA F34608-99-H-5004-0021 . <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

C.1.1 Terminology:
C.1.1.1 The system – A Learning Management System (LMS) or Learning Content Management System (LCMS) that can be installed on a government server, by government employed system administrators.  Administration, management, branding and configuration of the LMS or LCMS must be able to be performed by DFAS staff (once trained) without the assistance of the offering company and without further cost to the Government. No special code compilations by the vendor or vendor only configuration processes should be required in order for the DFAS staff to install and implement the software product.  
C.1.1.2 LMS - A learning management system (LMS) is a Web-based technology used to plan, implement, and assess a specific learning process. A learning management system provides an instructor with a way to create and deliver content, monitor student participation, and assess student performance. A learning management system may also provide students with the ability to use interactive features such as threaded discussions, video conferencing, and discussion forums. The Advanced Distance Learning group, sponsored by the United States Department of Defense, has created a set of specifications called Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) to encourage the standardization of learning management systems.
C.1.1.3 LCMS - A Learning Content Management System (LCMS) is a multi-user Web-based technology where learning developers may create, store, reuse, manage, and deliver digital learning content from a central object repository. LCMS products allow users to create and reuse digital learning content/assets. An LCMS manages the process of creating, storing and delivering learning content. Some components of an LCMS are: an authoring application (editors), a learning object repository, a dynamic delivery interface, and administration tools.
C.1.1.4 Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) - is an XML-based framework used to define and access information about learning objects so they can be easily shared among different learning management systems (LMSs). SCORM was developed in response to a United States Department of Defense (DoD) initiative to promote standardization in e-learning. The SCORM specifications, which are distributed through the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative Network, define an XML-based means of representing course structures, an application programming interface (API), a content-to-LMS data model, a content launch specification, and a specification for metadata records for all components of a system. 
C.1.1.5 Student – A student is an end-user of “the system" that is enrolled in online classes.  A learner following a course of study in the LMS.
C.1.1.6 Curriculum - The Top level of a course of study. Composed of Courses. The set of courses, coursework, and their content that meets the requirements for successful completion of training assignments.
C.1.1.7 Course - Composed of Lessons. Education imparted in a series of lessons that meets the requirements for successful certification in the information presented.
C.1.1.8 Lesson - Composed of SCO's or Modules. A unit of instruction completely covering a discrete topic.
C.1.1.9 Sharable Content Object (SCO) - Composed of Objects.  A standardized learning object that can communicate to learning management and content management systems. The smallest standalone piece of learning. 
C.1.1.10 Module - synonymous with SCO. Composed of Objects.  A learning object that can communicate to learning management and content management systems.  The smallest standalone piece of learning.
C.1.1.11 Objects – Are learning resources. The smallest components of a SCO or Module that teach through text or images. They may be web pages, graphics, video, documents, slide shows, spreadsheets, quizzes or assessments. Some typical file types associated with these objects are: (html, doc, pdf, xls, ppt, swf, wav, gif, jpg, png).
C.1.1.12 Look and Feel - The user interface of "the system". The look refers to how logos, graphics, menus and other elements are laid out on the page. The feel refers to the interactions: the way menus are organized and the way functions are selected and performed (the "method of operation"). The ability to apply the DPAS identity, (our own "Look and Feel") a unique name, color scheme, text presentation and images for our product by creating a consistent theme. 
C.1.1.13 Branding - synonymous with "Look and Feel" Applying the DPAS identity, (our own "Look and Feel"), a unique name, color scheme, text presentation, layout, logos, images and graphics for our product creating a consistent theme. 
C.1.2. BACKGROUND:  
The DPAS/CAMS-ME systems are currently utilizing an Angel LMS to provide e-learning for approximately 4500 students.  It is operated on a single dual-core 2.2 gigahertz processor with 4 gigabytes of memory and requires less than 100 gigabytes of disk space.  Current backups are taken manually.  
DPAS currently has approximately 92 shared content objects (SCOs) spread across 10 lessons within 30 courses.  CAMS-ME currently has six lessons within one course.  Courses, lessons and SCOs are added as needed to both systems.  Both systems have a separate look and feel (branding) and students are separated by curriculum, courses and lessons.  Student access, based on job requirements, is provided through these categories.  
Student information including progress and competencies is maintained by the LMS.  The current LMS is Section 508 and Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) 1.3 compliant. 
The typical DPAS course is composed of single or multiple “lessons”.  These “lessons” are made up of one to many Shareable Content Objects (SCO’s). These SCO’s are built from Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages, video files such as Flash, document files such as Portable Document Format (.pdf) and Microsoft Word (.doc) files and image files such as Graphical Interchange Format File (.gif), Portable Network Graphic (.png) and Joint Photographic Experts Group (.jpg).
C.2.0. APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS: 
C.2.1. Public law Section 508 1194.21, DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8500.2, Information Assurance Implémentation
C.3.0. REQUIREMENTS/TASKS:  
The vendor shall provide a web based LMS or LCMS (as defined in section C.1.1 and hereafter known as “the system”) with licenses for 7,000 users.  

Your response should be organized according to the requirements table that follows in C.3.1.  Please address all items completely.  If a requested feature is available now within your system, please mark Yes and respond with a succinct, yet comprehensive description of the feature.  Include any screen images to illustrate features or clarify the methodology used by the system to meet the requirements.  If the requested feature is not available in the proposed system, please clearly respond with “No” and type “Feature not available” in the comments section.  

DFAS will determine the offering that best meets these requirements based on the degree to which DFAS feels the offered system meets these requirements.  Provide a detailed description of how “the system” meets each requirement, along with supporting screen images whenever possible.  Failure to provide sufficient detail to allow DFAS to make this determination will result in a lower rating in the DFAS determination of how the system meets the DFAS requirements. Any functionality offered as an illustration of how the offered system meets the requirements MUST BE INCLUDED in the price quoted in CLIN 0001.  If this functionality is not included in the base system, line item costing of optional “tools” must be separately identified and included in CLIN 0001, as the firm fixed-price for each quote shall be evaluated as all-inclusive. DFAS does not anticipate any additional follow-on support services from the LMS vendor. 

DFAS has no intent to consider a system that requires customization by the vendor or vendor assistance in the customization of the system.  It is imperative that the system be ready as-is and delivered within ten (10) days after award. DFAS will not consider any system that requires vendor changes to program code in order to modify the screen appearance as viewed by the end student.   The branding of the system must be able to be accomplished by the DFAS staff after vendor training.

Non-responsive or non-descriptive answers will indicate a lack of support for that requirement and the applicable LMS will be rated less favorably, accordingly.  

The first seven (7) requirements of C.3.1 are identified as “absolutes”.  Failure to clearly demonstrate the ability to meet any of these requirements will result in the offeror being removed from consideration for award.  The remaining requirements are listed in priority order. The requirement with the highest priority is listed first.  These requirements are weighted based on this priority order.

14.		“The system” shall provide authorized DFAS employees access to the system database.  This will include access via outside programs written by the DFAS staff and any reporting tools or methods provided as part of “the system”.  The offeror will provide the database schema, data dictionary and any documentation concerning any API calls allowing access to “the system” data.

Example:
A student passes a course by completing a test successfully. The passing score on the test causes a DFAS created program to be spawned that verifies the passing score in "the systems" database and communicates this to another DFAS created application.		
15.		“The system” itself (not the courseware as written by DFAS) shall provide the ability to hide and reveal course content, system resources and quiz's/quiz questions based on student actions/triggers as they access course material.  Hidden content should not be visible to the student until revealed by an action. It should not be accessible by table of contents, search or any other tool provided to the student.
Examples of this feature would include:

•	Exams that are not accessible by the student until completion of predetermined activities.
•	Links to external URLs that are not accessible by the student until completion of predetermined activities.
•	Lesson resources that are not accessible by the student until completion of predetermined activities.

Please describe how “the system” shall provide this ability		
16.		“The system” shall provide a common library or repository for quiz and exam questions.

Quiz questions are created in or uploaded to this central repository and the updated questions will become active in all quizzes linked to the question. Multiple quizzes will reference a single instance of a question.

Example:
Course's 1010, 1020, and 1030 all contain quiz One which contains question Two. Changes are made to question Two. The updated question is now visible in quiz one in course's 1010, 1020 and 1030.		
17.		“The system” shall provide the ability to randomly retrieve quiz/exam questions from the repository through the use of “keywords”.  This will allow the DFAS staff to create a pool of questions concerning “Topic A” that can be randomly selected anytime questions for “Topic A” are required.

Example:
Course's 1010, 1020, and 1030 all contain information about Topic A. The repository contains twenty (20) questions about Topic A with the "keyword" Topic A. The course 1010 has a quiz that randomly selects a set of ten (10) questions from the Topic A question pool to present to the student. Course 1020 has a quiz that randomly selects a set of fifteen (15) questions from Topic A question pool to present to the student. Course 1030 has a quiz that randomly selects a set of five (5) questions from Topic A question pool to present to the student. Each time a quiz containing Topic A questions is invoked a random set of Topic A questions are presented to the student from the pool.		
18.		“The system” shall provide a quiz/exam creation engine. The engine will provide for the creation and importation of quiz questions and the creation of quizzes.

It will have the ability to create questions that:
•	reside in a common repository grouped by keyword
•	allow for both positive and negative feedback
•	are copied from existing questions
•	scramble the answers to multiple choice questions

It will have the ability to create quizzes that:
•	have the ability to select questions to populate a quiz based on keywords
•	can be hidden until a student action reveals them
•	can be locked until a student action unlocks them
•	can trigger an action based on a student’s successful or unsuccessful completion of the quiz
•	automatically posts grades to the grade book
•	retains a history of all a students quiz attempts
•	provide summary reporting of quiz results by student
•	provide detail reporting of quiz results by student
•	provide item analysis of responses by question		
19.		“The system” shall provide a visible indicator of the student's course completion progress.  These indicators should roll up from the lowest course component (SCO/Module) to the highest (Course) and be visible to students, instructors, mentors, and administrators.  This visible indicator “widget” should provide a graphical view to the student of his/her progress within each registered course.

Example: Within a course, there may be ten course modules.  As the student completes each module, there is a visible indication (such as a checkmark or green dot) that clearly identifies completion of the module.		
20.		The system shall retain student course history. This history will be retained and accessible after courses are retired or removed.		
21.		“The system” shall provide a print capability for course content at the Course, Lesson, SCO/Module and object level.  This capability must be something above the ability to “print screen” available in the browser and allow the student to print parts or all of the course for themselves.		
22.		“The system” shall provide the ability to expire seat licenses for inactive users.  These licenses should become available for re-use by other system users.  Course history will always be retained on any expired or inactive users.		
23.		“The system” shall allow for incremental seat licenses at quantities specified by the government.  The Government may need to expand the number of students during the life of the contract.  State whether you allow the addition of seat licenses, what increments these can be added to the existing agreement and the cost per seat or the cost per upgrade block.		
24.		“The system” shall provide a centralized content repository or library for course content. Content is uploaded to this central repository and the updated material will become active in all courses linked to the content. Multiple courses will reference a single instance of a resource.
Our typical course structure(Refer to C.1.1 Terminology):
 Course> - composed of > Lessons - composed of >SCO's/Module's - composed of >Objects/Resources (quizzes ,html, doc, pdf, xls, ppt, swf, wav ,gif, jpg ,png...)


Example:
Course's 1010, 1020, and 1030 all contain SCO/Module One. Changes are made to SCO/Module One outside the LMS. The updated SCO/Module One is uploaded into the content repository or library in its appropriate location within the master course structure (it only resides in one location - there is no duplication of the SCO/Module). The changes to SCO/Module One are now visible in course's 1010, 1020 and 1030.		
25.		"The system" shall  provide E-mail distribution by administrator defined grouping.

Example:
An administrator may select a group of students to mass E-mail an announcement based on information contained in "the system" (group, curriculum, course, role, agency) using "the systems" E-mail functionality to distribute the mail. This functionality will include the capability to send E-mail to addresses external to the system.		
26.		“The system” shall provide a keyword search capability for course content at the Course, Lesson, SCO/Module and object level.

Example:  A student can search for “XYZ” and will get a list of results referencing “XYZ” in courses that student is registered for or (global search), if the student is working in a course, that student will receive a list of results from lessons, SCOs or objects within the course		
27.		“The system” shall provide unattended, background course backup abilities above and beyond those provided by the database utilities.  This backup feature should backup course content and student histories to allow for specific restoration of course and student information without restoring the entire system.

Example:
The DFAS administrator starts a backup of courses 1010, 1020 and 1030 using "the system" backup. The process runs to completion unattended. He may archive these backups for future retrieval. Should the need arise he can restore all three courses or only one of them.		
28.		The system shall provide the ability to create and access DFAS administrator defined variables (i.e. custom).  Please disclose how many custom fields are available.

Student Level
“The system” shall allow for DFAS created/specified database fields to contain demographic information about the students.

Example: Adding Agency information to "the system" by student that can be accessed for reporting.  

If this is accomplished via an additional tool, please disclose any costs and/or services involved.		
29.		“The system” shall provide the ability to import SCORM 1.2 content packages.		
30.		“The system” shall provide the ability to import IMS content packages.		
31.		 “The system” shall have the ability to support non-SCORM based courses.  

Example:
DFAS creates a course external to "the system".  "The system" administrator creates a course structure in the LMS defining the course, lesson, and modules. He then copies the individual resources (files)  into the appropriate area of the course structure and links them in to create a fully functional course.		
32.		The system shall provide standard (stock, out of the box) student, mentor, instructor, group and overall training reporting capabilities. 
The following standard reports are required:

<p>Award will be made on the basis of determining the technically acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated price which meets or exceeds the requirements. Once an offer has been determined to be technically acceptable then the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price will be awarded the contract. If an offer is not technically acceptable it will not be considered.

Offerors who are providing an "or equal" shall include in their quote a sample to include descriptive literature or description literatures such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference, such as a web site to information readily available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. If an offeror cannot comply with every requirement that offer will not be considered</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The following clauses apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>The clause at FAR 52.212-4, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS applies to this acquisition and the following addenda, applies:</p>

<p>(a) The Government requires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:</p>
<p>REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>

<p>1001 1400 PAK ___________________________</p>
<p>2001 1400 PAK ___________________________</p>
<p>(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding<br />(1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or<br />(2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)

DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The Shasta-Trinity National Forest’s Redding Air Attack Base requires their 6,000-gallon underground concrete wastewater tank to be emptied and certified cleaned.  Non-hazardous wastewater material was generated from the fire retardant mixing plant operations and seasonal plane wash downs.  The tank is approximately 32-feet long with a manhole opening on each end and six additional lids to access the four tank compartments (see tank drawings). At last inspection, the tank was full of wastewater and the accumulated solids were estimated to be between 1 to 1.5-feet in depth from the end manholes. The three feet of cover material above the tank will be removed prior to the pre-bid site visit scheduled on December 2nd, 2009.

TANK LOCATION:  Redding Air Attack Base at 6101 Airport Road, Redding, CA 96002 

TASKS:
1.  Remove all wastewater, sludge and solids accumulation from 6,000-gallon underground concrete storage tank. 
2.  Rinse out and certify clean the 6,000-gallon underground storage tank.
3.  Transport offsite and recycle or treat removed tank waste.
SPECIFICATIONS:
Contractor shall follow all applicable federal, state, county and local regulations and standards.  All interested vendors may inspect tank at 10:00 am on December 2, 2009 to access existing site conditions.  Offerors shall provide a brief work plan describing how all work will be completed including a start work date and duration, equipment and personnel to be used, their capability to pump and remove all sludge/solids from an estimated 10-ft below ground surface, any past relevant experience, and the planned destination for recycling or treatment of the tanks contents.  Final work plan must be approved in writing by the Government prior to work starting.  Tank contents are a “non-hazardous industrial wastewater” based on analytical testing from samples taken on August 12, 2009, although proper treatment or recycling is necessary because of the presence of pollutants in the wastewater (see test data and phos-chek MSDS).    All tank contents shall be transported offsite on a “Non-Hazardous Waste Manifest” to be recycled or treated.  The 6,000-gallon underground storage tank is a confined space and no entry will be allowed, unless a minimum three-person crew is confined space certified and approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.  After all initial liquids, sludge, and solids are removed, the tank interior shall be washed down and rinsed clean of all pollutants. Rinse water or rinsate shall be removed and the tank shall be left empty when completed.  Contractor shall demonstrate that all tank material has been removed and certify the tank as clean. Clean is defined as no visible solid material from tank lid visual inspections and digital photos. COR shall inspect tank for cleanliness prior to the Governments acceptance of contractor’s certification.  References: Plan and Profile drawings of 6,000-gallon underground storage tank ( July 1986), Phos-chek fire retardant MSDS, and analytical test data.

(To be provided at the time of award) is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The COTR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the Contractor by a unilateral modification to the Contract. The COTR is located at: (to be provided at the time of award).<br />b. The responsibilities and limitations of the COTR are as follows:<br />(1) The COTR is responsible for the technical aspects of the project and serves as technical liaison with the Contractor.

<p>NOAA/ERAD METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR<br />SHIP REPAIR (AUGUST 2005)</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule, as follows:</p>
<p>A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be reduced by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar work items.)</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.232-25 will be returned. Invoices shall include (see the clause for a full summation of invoice requirements):</p>
<p>Name and Address of the contractor;<br />Invoice date<br />Contract Number/Modification No.<br />CLIN/Work Item No., Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price;<br />Shipping and Payment Terms;<br />Name and Address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent;<br />Name, title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.</p>
<p>The invoice must include:</p>
<p>a) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />b) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />c) Ship name; and,<br />d) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.</p>
<p>Note: When invoicing for growth work, the contractor shall identify it as Growth and shall identify the modification number to which authorization was given and the CLIN/work item that the growth is associated.</p>
<p>The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33). Contractors are located and identified in CCR by their DUNS number. Therefore, to facilitate payment, it is in the contractor's best interest to ensure that the DUNS number is recorded on every invoice submitted against this contract.</p>
<p>All payments based on percentage or stage of completion rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend percentage or stage of completion payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration provided all supporting documentation is submitted and validated.</p>
<p>Additional work verbally agreed to by the parties that has not yet been incorporated into the contract by modification shall not be included in an invoice. Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed. Invoices submitted for payment that includes such a request will be reduced by the unmodified amount.</p>
<p>Invoices shall be mailed to the designated billing office, as follows:</p>
<p>Department of Commerce/NOAA<br />Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD)<br />Attn: Christine Jeffries<br />200 Granby Street, 8th Floor<br />Norfolk, VA 23510<br />Christine.Jeffries@noaa.gov</p>
<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER EA133M-10-SU-XXXX (to be assigned upon contract award). &#61618;</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD ADDITIONAL ITEM REQUESTS LABOR RATE (MARCH 2005)<br /><br />The Additional Item Requests (AIRs) labor rate (CLIN 0002) offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>a. The rate for all man-hours of labor, to be used for emergent work if ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the "Changes - Ship Repair" or mutually agreed upon by the parties by supplemental agreement to accomplish additional work not required elsewhere in the work items, shall be established using this labor rate. The estimated man-hours for these repairs are listed in Section B. <br /><br />b. This rate shall be a flat rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:</p>
<p>1 . Production man-hours shall be for skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in <br />direct production as exemplified by the following functions: Abrasive Cleaning/Blasting, Blacksmithing, Boilermaking, Carpentry, Crane Operation, Electrical/Electronics Work, Engineering (Production), Insulating/Lagging, Machining (inside and outside), Painting, Pipe Fitting, Rigging, Sheet-metal Work, Shipfitting, Shipwrights, Staging/Scaffolding, Tank Cleaning, and Welding/Burning/Brazing.<br /><br />2 . Non-production man-hours (whether charged as direct labor or indirect labor by the contractors accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production man-hours. Examples of support functions include: Engineering (support), Estimating, General Labor, Firewatch, Material Handling, Planning, Quality Assurance, Security (General), Supervision, Surveying, Testing, and Transportation.</p>
<p>3 . Other indirect charges including but not limited to the following: overhead, general and administrative, support functions, facilities, and capital cost of money and profit for the contractor and any subcontractors selected by the prime contractor. The hourly rate will not be used to price work which may be directed to a subcontractor by name in the work specifications.</p>
<p>c. All material costs shall be paid based on the contractor's return cost plus the markup identified in Section B (CLIN 0003). The estimated value of additional material for this item is also listed in Section B.</p>
<p>d. The contractor shall take into account full award of estimated AIRs hours during the development of the Production Schedule. Award of any portion of this item does not in its self justify an extension to the original contract completion date.<br /><br />e. The quantities of AIRs labor hours (CLIN 0002) and additional material (CLIN 0003) indicated in Section B are only estimates and are Growth Items pursuant to this solicitation. The provided burdened man-hour rates and material cost rate shall remain in effect for the entire life of the contract. The estimated quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours/material that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule at its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusions of these items do not obligate the Government to exercise the item(s) nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

<DESC>The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296) states that DHS S&amp;T will "support basic and applied homeland security research to promote revolutionary changes in technologies; advance the development, testing and evaluation, and deployment of critical homeland security technologies; and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that would address homeland security vulnerabilities." Pursuant to this mission, the Chemical Biological Division (CBD) seeks technologies to prevent, detect, and defend against a biological attack. The focus of this BAA is in the area of bacterial biothreat agent detection, surveillance, and identification research.
<p>The threat of terrorist or criminal use of pathogenic organisms and their toxins remains of great concern in the United States. In order to address capability gaps in this area and support the Surveillance and Detection Pillar of the National Biomonitoring Architecture (NBMA), the development of rapid and specific detection methods are needed to provide reliable analysis on a variety of bacterial biothreat agents. As part of the effort to deter biological terrorism and strengthen the capabilities of the biodefense and public health laboratory response, it is important to explore both classic and alternative methods and approaches to address the critical need to rapidly detect bacterial biothreat agent antigens and toxins of interest.</p>

Contracts based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law (PL) 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984." A formal Request for Proposals (RFP) will not be issued. Awards under this BAA are planned in Fiscal Year (FY) 2010. No contract awards or other instruments that obligate funds will be made until appropriated funds are available from which payment for contract purposes can be made.<br /><br />Please see attached BAA document for additional details.&nbsp;</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

The JCC-I/A Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within JCC-I/A, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the Agency Protest, the Agency Protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">(b) An interested party may file a written protest to the Contracting Officer under the JCC-I/A Agency Protest program for contract solicitations issued by JCC-I/A. Such Agency Protests are limited to objections to any of the following:</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">(1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services. (2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">(3) An award or proposed award of the contract.</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">(4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(c) Voluntary Automatic Stay. This provision describes the circumstances under which JCC-I/A voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Agency Protest, as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4).</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">(1) In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest. This is known as an "automatic stay" and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the GAO under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a "Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay"). However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden. This is known as an automatic stay "override."</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">(2) The CICA stay applies only if the GAO protest is filed within 10 days from notice of award, or within 5 days of a required debriefing. A firm may file a JCC-I/A Agency Protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agency's protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest. Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies.</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">(3) The JCC-I/A voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the JCC-I/A Agency Protest Program. Should the interested party disagree with the Contracting Officer's or RCC/Division Chief's resolution of an Agency Protest, it may appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC) or utilize another protest forum. The JCC-I/A Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protester's right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action. In return for the protester's initially filing its protest as an Agency Protest instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the Contracting Officer or RCC/Division Chief's decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start. This means that in an Agency Protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO. Nothing in this provision adversely affects an interested party's rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action.</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">(4) However, an appeal and review of the Contracting Officer's Agency Protest decision by the PARC will not extend the GAO's timeliness requirements. Therefore, any subsequent protest to the GAO must be filed within 10 days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's Agency Protest decision.</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">(d) An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this provision for resolution of protests.</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">(e) For the purpose of filing a JCC-I/A Agency Protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">(f) An Agency Protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number or e-mail address; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of Contracting Officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an Agency Protest for decision by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: none">(g) JCC-I/A Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from JCC-I/A, Victory Regional Contracting Office,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Matthew A.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in">(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(A)<em> The tax liability is finally determined. </em>The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(B)<em> The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.</em> A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in">(ii) Examples.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<CONTACT>Robert M. Parvin, Contract Officer, Phone 785-274-1944, Fax 785-274-1642, Email robert.parvin@us.army.mil
<DESC>Description: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be utilized. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a full and open competition under NAICS code 811113 (Automotive Transmission Repair). Solicitation reference number W912JC-10-R-5701 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the overhaul of the MT654 Allison Transmission NSN: 2520-01-117-3010. See NMWR reference 9-2520-594 attached.

Contract Type and Estimated Quantities: This solicitation will be awarded as an Indefinite Delivery – Indefinite Quantity Firm Fixed Price contract. The base year contract begins approximately February 2010 thru January 2011 with the option for four additional one-year periods. The additional one year contract options are exercised if the product performance and customer service from the contractor is deemed to be of a satisfactory or better nature. The estimated quantities: Maximum quantity 150 each 1st contract base year and 150 each thereafter for each option year exercised with a minimum qty of 40 per year. Offerors shall base proposals on the stated guaranteed minimum quantities for the purpose of a contract award. Any discounts offered based on quantities greater than the stated minimum shall be welcome but not considered for the purposes of the contract award. The contract award will be made to the top two submitted RFP’s total average of the base year and all option years provided the proposals and the First Article has been designated technically acceptable. 

Schedule: Offerors shall submit a delivery schedule in accordance their anticipated monthly capabilities.  Offerors should have the capability to overhaul at least the estimated maximum of 150 (per vendor) MT654 Allison Transmissions in accordance with Allison Standards within the prescribed contract year (max required 25 per month). Actual or perceived misrepresentations of the offeror’s overhaul capacity discovered prior to or after contract award are subject to being deemed non-responsive or contract termination for the convenience of the Government. 

-	Awarded contractor will also provide a weekly status report of the MT654 Transmission overhaul. The status report will include but is not limited to nomenclature, P/N, order #; qty left on order, qty at facility, lead time and estimated delivery date. Pick-up and deliveries will be made at the KS-Readiness Sustainment Maintenance Site (RSMS), Camp Funston-BLDG 1598, FT Riley, KS 66442. 

Technical: Offerors must submit a proposal that includes detailed information about their overhaul process as a requirement of technical acceptability standards to be considered for an award. A proposal that merely reiterates or promises to accomplish the requirements of the RFP will be considered non-responsive. The OEM holds the proprietary technical specifications. This acquisition of services is restricted to qualified Allison Transmission technicians with the required tool pack for service and overhaul process in order to maintain the quality of the MT654 Transmission. Any offerors submitting a proposal without the appropriate qualifications will be dismissed without discussion as not being technically acceptable to the Government’s requirements. Firms that recognize and can service the required item described above are encouraged to submit a proposal. 
  - Mandatory replacement parts irrespective of MT654 Transmission Core condition (see attached).  
  - Transmission will be painted (color and type to be determined).
  - Each overhauled transmission shall contain its own Dynamometer report.
  - Explain process required to overhaul the MT654 Allison Transmission from receipt of core to Dyno test and shipment back to KS-RSMS for technical evaluation of proposal.
  - The awarded offeror shall designate one overall Point of Contact concerning all aspects of this contract responsible for communication concerning quality issues and overall contract performance.
  - On time deliveries to include the ratio of successful inspected items in comparison with Quality Deficiency Reports (QDR’s). An awarded offeror’s expected learning curve shall result in less than a 5% monthly QDR report of which is averaged on an annual basis to assist in determining if option years will be extended. The Government recognizes and expects the learning curve to vary between offerors and is taken into consideration. 
Cost: The award will be determined by the offer that is Lowest Price and Technically Acceptable. A technically acceptable proposal is one in which the contractor meets all requirements listed in the solicitation. Proposals unrealistically high or low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between proposed performance and price must be clearly explained in the price proposal.  For example, if unique and innovative approaches or conditions are the basis for an unbalanced/inconsistently priced proposal, the nature of these approaches and their impact on price must be completely documented.  
-	Delivery costs of the MT654 transmission shall be borne by the awarded contract offeror to and from the KS-RSMS and therefore offerors should take this into consideration when submitting a proposal. The proposal should include details concerning the shipping method of the transmission cores. The KS-RSMS will provide transmission cradles for the purpose of shipping to and from the KS-RSMS facility if requested in the proposal by the offeror. Returned Transmissions should be sufficiently covered or crated to protect the completed cores against miscellaneous damage. 

First Article: First article to be provided to customer (KS RSMS) within 15 working days of core pick up for evaluation. Successful inspection of first article by KS RSMS is required prior to award. The submitted proposal shall include the cost of the first article but this cost is not included in the final award determination. Any offeror that has previously performed this service for the KS-RSMS within the past two years in a technically acceptable manner is exempt from the first article requirement. First article approval will be in accordance with FAR 52.209-3 for which paragraph a-g will apply.  

Clarification of Standards: This overhaul procedure is required to return the MT654 Transmission to a FULLY SERVICEABLE condition IAW Allison Transmission overhaul standards. The transmission will be rebuilt to all OEM torques and settings; therefore items received for repair will NOT be reconfigured to cause a change in the model designation. This procedure is NOT a reconditioning as defined by FAR PART 52.211-5 MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS, which means restored to the original normal operating condition by readjustments and material replacement as needed. The mandatory replacement parts attached to this solicitation do apply (ref NMWR 9-2520-594). 

-	It shall be the obligation of the offeror to exercise due diligence to discover and to bring to the attention of the Contracting Officer at the earliest possible time any ambiguities, discrepancies, inconsistencies, or conflicts in or between the specifications and the applicable drawings or other documents incorporated by reference herein. The offeror may, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, be asked to provide clarifications regarding their proposals. The offeror shall be held responsible for the validity of all information supplied in their proposal. Should subsequent investigation disclose that the facts and conditions were not as stated; the proposal and/or award may be terminated for the convenience of the Government due to non-technical acceptability of Government requirements.

Warranty: KS RSMS is requiring the awarded contractor(s) to provide a 1 year warranty from date of installation or 18 months from date of shipment from supplier (whichever occurs first) for each overhauled MT654 transmission core. The warranty will only be applicable to the workmanship and not misuse. If the transmission fails incoming inspection the KS RSMS will log the failure on a quality deficiency report (QDR) and contact awarded contractor(s) for corrective action. The contractor(s) must be able to service these units within the warranty period on-site within the Continental United States and should consider this factor when submitting a bid.

Past Performance: Information should include a list of prior contracts for this item awarded within the past 3 years if applicable. The information shall include a valid point of contact, mailing address, telephone number, contract number and dollar amount. It is incumbent upon the offeror to include the most current contact information of prior contracts.  Not doing so or having negative past performance with a previous vendor may cause the offeror to be found not technically acceptable and removed from consideration of award. 

-	Past Performance while not a sole indicator of the offerors ability to meet the Government’s requirement, it is still a consideration factor to assess an offeror’s technical acceptability (i.e. the lowest price that meets the Government’s technical requirement will be awarded). The responsibility of clarifying corrected past performance issues is solely incumbent upon the offeror. The final determination is at the discretion of the Contract Officer making the award.  

Proposed Deviations: If the offeror takes exception to any of the requirements specified in this solicitation, the offeror shall clearly identify each such exception and include a complete explanation of why the proposed deviation was made and what benefit accrues to the Government. All deviations should be accompanied with supporting rationale and clearly labeled "Deviation". An addendum is only required if the offeror takes exception to any requirement in the solicitation. (The Addendum does not have a page limitation, but shall only include information relevant to exceptions taken to the solicitation requirements.)  The Government will assume an offeror takes no exceptions to any solicitation requirement if the offeror does not submit an addendum identifying proposed deviations. Offerors are advised that solicitation requirements are not necessarily negotiable and such deviations may render an offeror's proposal unacceptable and ineligible for award.  

Proposal Preparation Instructions: These instructions prescribe describe the approach for the development and presentation of the proposed data. The proposal shall include all of the information requested in the specific instructions. Failure to include all information requested may result in the dismissal of a proposal as non-responsive. This RFP does not commit the Government to pay costs incurred in preparation and submission of proposal information. 

-	Proposal format is subjective to the offeror’s preferred format that is orderly and sufficiently documented. Offerors are cautioned to submit enough information to enable the Government to fully ascertain each offeror’s capability to perform all of the requirements for a fair and thorough evaluation. It is requested that the priced items of the proposal are listed separately on their own page.
  
-	All commitments made in the proposal may become a part of the resultant contract. The data submitted with each proposal should be complete and concise, but not overly elaborate. Any materials submitted but not required by this solicitation, (such as company brochures), shall be relegated to appendices. Excessive reliance on promotional brochures is discouraged. Elaborate format and binding are neither necessary nor desirable. Submit proposals to the attention of CPT Robert M. Parvin, 2737 Kansas Ave, Topeka, KS 66611 or via e-mail at robert.parvin@us.army.mil not later than 2pm Central Standard Time on the designated response date listed in this Synopsis/Solicitation.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC>Q103: Please detail the exhaust configuration of the T700 cell.<br />A103: The current T700 Exhaust Configuration is square tube that is approximately three feet by three feet and extends 80 inches into the exhaust stack before to bends 90 degrees up and goes up for about six feet. The Augmenter tube is approximately 35 3/4 inches by 35 3/4 inches and is 3 1/2 feet deep. It is inserted in the exhaust tube and is adjustable to fit the placement of the engine.
<p>Q104: Please provide details in how the T700 augmenter tube discharges into the exhaust stack.<br />A104: The Augmenter tube is approximately 35 3/4 inches by 35 3/4 inches and is 3 1/2 feet deep. It is inserted in the exhaust tube and is adjustable to fit the placement of the engine.</p>
<p>Q105: What is the current operating condition of the existing ATF3-6 test cell hoists? The SOO states a requirement to have these components replaced. Is the requirement to replace both hoists trolley units or is the scope limited to only the hoist interface and controls? <br />A105: The current operating condition of the existing ATF3-6 test cell hoists is minimally acceptable. In accordance with the SOO section 5.0 REQUIREMENTS, This upgrade should include, but is not limited to, the following systems: 24. Hoist System and Controls. Both of the hoist and the control interfaces were original installed in 1986. As such both are obsolete and the models are no longer manufactured. Spare parts are rare and hard to find, therefore both the hoists and the control interface will need to be replaced. The replacement hoists could reuse the current rail system or may require replacement/modification of the rail system, depending on the model suggested in the contactors proposal.</p>
<p>Q106: Is it permitted to install underground sump tanks in the area behind the T700 cell?<br />A106: No, new sump tanks cannot be installed.</p>

<DESC><strong>A pre-proposal teleconference has been scheduled for December 4, 2009 at 10:00 am Eastern time. Organizations that will participate in this conference are requested to email the names of participants and number of lines they will be needing for the dial-in to jlewis@mail.nih.gov. The dial-in number is 1.800.366.7242, passcode is 84007.</strong> <br />
<p><br />Cancer research has benefited during the last decade from the development of novel genomic analyses technologies. Knowledge of the human transcriptome has resulted in tools that allow for the interrogation of most of transcribed sequenced (protein or non-protein coding). The availability of the reference human genome resulted in technology that identified many of the genomic changes at the chromosomal region/region copy number level as well as the ability to determine loss of heterozygosity. Finally, the recent development of sequencing by synthesis or ligation methods and the instrumentation to support them is providing powerful and more precise approaches to characterize the transcriptome (gene expression changes, chimeric transcripts etc.), genome (deletions, amplifications, translocations) and epigenome (changes of methylation profiles) of tumors and at the same time as identifying the changes at the single nucleotide level, including base mutations, small deletions, insertions (in/dels), etc. The 2nd generation sequencing technologies are still improving and there is an expectation that the successful Contractors will implement them once they are validated in a pipeline environment.</p>
<p>There has been some success in transforming discoveries of somatic aberrations, especially mutations, into clinical utility. The advances in characterization and sequencing using the new technologies allows a more rapid progress for these discoveries, therefore, NCI plans to bring the 2nd generation ("nextgen") sequencing technologies to bear on the TARGET Initiative.</p>
<p>With this procurement we seek to obtain that 2nd generation sequencing capacity to sequence between 94-188 pediatric cancer cases each for 2-5 different cancer types to identify DNA mutations (such point mutation, deletions, insertions, etc.). Cancer Cases will be provided by through the TARGET pipeline. 2nd generation sequencing is defined as sequencing by synthesis or ligation with massively parallel throughput (examples can be found in Mardis, ER Trends in Gen 24:133, 2008). The scope of sequencing is either the exome (the minimum is either ~6,000 genes as defined and specified below or the complete exome), the complete transcriptome or whole genome for the same number cases. The aim is to utilize the new sequencing technologies in a highly cost-effective, high-throughput and efficient manner (i.e. Sanger sequencing does not meet this programs goals).</p>
<p>The contractor is to provide their most current technology for the sequencing under the program. Therefore contractors may elect to sequence one of the below depending on what is required by their technology. The contract will be modified to reflect that technology and deliverables. The Contractor shall specify which technology is being proposed and what sequencing will be performed.</p>

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Dahlgren Site (NSWCDL) is seeking sources possessing the technology, qualifications, and capabilities to produce and demonstrate a high power microwave (HPM) antenna. NSWCDL is requesting white papers be submitted describing the Contractor's experience in design, development, fabrication and testing of HPM antennas. Information submitted should also contain organizational capabilities and a Rough Order of Magnitude cost for design and production of a prototype for demonstration purposes. The HPM antenna should have the ability to meet the following technical requirements: 
A) Constant power density beam profile in terms of radius and particularly distance from the antenna for a range of 1 to 30 meters. B) Operation at the following three frequencies (one will be selected for demonstration):1) 2.45 GHz, 2) 5.8 GHz, 3) 95 GHzC) Minimum pulse width is .5 seconds. D) Maximum power density prescribed by IEEE Standard C95.1-2005 for Permissible Exposure Limit(s) plus 20% and minimum pulse. E) Input power is to be managed such that radiated intensities do not exceed the subject PEL limits by more than 120%. PEL Limits are: 1) For the 2.45 GHz  antenna - 58.8 kW/m2;  2) For the 5.8 GHz  antenna - 35.4 kW/m2; 3) For the 95 GHz antenna - 3.5 kW/m2F) After a .5 second pulse, the wait times before another pulse is permitted are: 	1) 2.45 GHz - 6 minutes	2) 5.8 GHz - 2 minutes 57 seconds	3) 95 GHz - 17 secondsG) Determine required peak power input based upon antenna beam profile and PEL power density.H) Circular polarized beamI) Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) less than 1.5J) Preferred Beam Diameter Range .5 to 1.5 metersK) Minimal side lobe/back side powerL) No "beam hotspots" greater than the PEL power densityM) Tripod mount configuration
The objective is to examine different technical approaches that would allow NSWCDL to demonstrate the HPM antenna for warfare system purposes. Accordingly, NSWCDL seeks sources who can effectively present their capabilities to do the following: 
A) Minimize size and weight of the antenna, B) Execute the shortest timeline possible with regards to the Level 3 WBS schedule, C) Utilize commercial off the shelf components (COTS) to the greatest degree possible D) Provide ease of mobility and setup E) Offer a Performance warranty F) Fulfill requirements at a reasonable cost to the Government
White papers being submitted for review should include the following information for one, two, or three of the frequencies of interest:
	A) Antenna type	B) Responsive Technical Specification	C) Detailed description for each of the following:		1) Size and Weight2) Rough Order of Magnitude cost for potential Government procurement regarding:				a) Design			b) Production of Prototype			b) Factory Test and Validation			c) Material Supply			d) Field Test and ValidationD) Modeling methodologies and model outputs that support technical specifications	E) Engineered material details	F) Plan for field measurements and design validationG) 3-D model and field measurement plots for antenna pattern radiation lobes and beam widthsH) Table of Antenna Parameter Metrics and Specifications including symbol, parameter, value, units, and summary explanation for:	1) Radiation power density	2) Gain	3) Antenna efficiency	4) Beam efficiency	5) Bandwidth	6) Polarization	7) Input impedence	8) Radiation efficiency	9) Antenna operating peak and average temperature change from ambientI) Relevant experience history and list of client referencesJ) Experience and resume history for project principalsK) Input Transition Coupling detail
