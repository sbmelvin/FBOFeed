<ARCHDATE>12012015
<CONTACT>Tanya Spanfellner, Contracting Officer, Phone 208-373-4130, Email tspanfellner@fs.fed.us
<DESC>To better understand the amount of recreation use and user satisfaction on the National Forests, the USDA Forest Service is surveying users on all forests through a random sampling system over the next four years. The Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest is being sampled during the fiscal year 2015.
<p>The Humboldt-Toiyabe N. F. has 317 surveys to be taken beginning November 1, 2015 (or earliest date contract can be signed) through September 30, 2016. If the contract cannot be awarded by November 1, 2015, contract price will be negotiated with the successful bidder based on the earliest possible start date and the number of surveys on the Survey Calendar (Exhibit 1) after that date.</p>
<p>Actual duration of the survey (when applicable) takes 6 hours at the site. In addition, road and or trail traffic counters (as required) shall be placed to count traffic for a 24 hour period of time, which includes the survey time. AM surveys take place between 8am and 2pm. PM surveys take place between 2pm and 8pm. Survey times may be adjusted by negotiations between the Contractor and the Forest NVUM Coordinator as needed to avoid conducting surveys during hours of darkness.</p>
<p>It is important that each survey be completed on the prescribed date and time as indicated on the attached schedule. No tolerance is allowed for convenience to persons performing the survey. The only reason for a survey to be delayed would be that the site is physically closed or access to the site is blocked. For such cases, a back-up calendar of survey locations will be provided.</p>
<p>In extenuating circumstances, when multiple staff are required for survey work on different districts on the same day, the contractor can work with the Forest NVUM Coordinator, preferably at the time of contract award, but at least three weeks ahead of the survey date in question, to ensure that one survey site is covered by a USFS employee, allowing the Contractor to focus on the other survey site(s). Generally, however, the Contractor should plan to cover all survey sites and days.</p>
<p>Location or Delivery</p>
<p>The actual survey sites are situated at specified Forest Developed Recreation Sites or other dispersed area locations on or near the Humboldt-Toiyabe N.F. A schedule will be included with a list of all the survey sites, and Forest Visitor Maps will be provided to the Contractor. District staff will be available to help the Contractor locate all survey sites. Maps with survey sites will be provided to the Contractor.</p>
<p>Accessibility by motor vehicle is generally good, although four-wheel drive and a high clearance vehicle may be required to access some survey sites. Most survey sites are reached by graded roads at a minimum, and paved roads in some cases. Weather and related road conditions could make access difficult in some of the more remote locations. Some wilderness survey sites may be interior to wilderness boundaries and must be accessed by foot or horse (no motorized or mechanized vehicle use is permitted inside wilderness areas; refer to Exhibits 3-7, maps). The Humboldt-Toiyabe N. F. has many geographically isolated districts and recreation sites, spanning the entire state of Nevada and a small portion of land in California.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to re-compete requirements currently being performed under NIA Contract HHSN27120110002I. This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures under FAR Part 15.  It is anticipated that a single indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contract will be awarded for a 10-year period of performance beginning on or about August 26, 2016, to develop, maintain, and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined laboratory rats for use by investigators in studies of aging.  This colony is to be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity.<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND<br /></strong><br />Current and projected experiments using rodents to model the aging processes and age-related diseases in humans require animals of defined genotype and controlled environmental and health status.  Only with the meticulous, long-term control of genetic and environmental variables is it possible to maintain relevant animal models that may be used to study many of the biological and behavioral processes in aging. Therefore, a continuous supply of genetically defined, well characterized inbred and hybrid laboratory animals is essential for a program of research on aging.  In 2011, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) awarded a 9-year contract for the development and maintenance of a colony of aged F344, Brown Norway (BN) and F344xBN F1 hybrid rats.  The Statement of Work for that Contract, HHSN271201100002I, stated that another 9-year contract for continuation of each project would be awarded at the start of the seventh year of that contract.  This acquisition is for development of a new contract that will cover the three (3) strains of rats, F344, BN, and F344xBN F1.<br /><br /><strong>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br /></strong><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined laboratory rats for use by investigators in studies of aging.  This colony is to be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity.<br /><br /><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS<br /></strong><br />The Contractor shall develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged rats of NIA-specified genotypes for use by investigators in studies of aging. The expected duration of this colony, and therefore of this requirement, is ten years.  During years 1 through 3, animals shall be entered into the colony, but few animals shall be removed from the colony except for the purposes of monitoring health and genetic purity. However, if the need should arise, animals may be distributed from the colony at anytime at the direction of the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). During years 4 through 7, animals shall continue to be entered into the colony and animals shall be distributed to investigators. This should be a period of stable operation with young animals entering the colony at approximately the same rate as older animals leave the colony due to distribution and normal attrition. The final three year period, years 8 through 10, will serve as the colony close-out period. Animals shall be maintained and disbursed, but entry of animals shall cease at the beginning of year 8 or when entries begin in a renewal contract colony. Thus, the population in this contract colony will decline over the last three year period to a point of near zero or very few animals at the end of year ten.<br /><br />The colony population at the end of each year of the ten year period should be approximately as follows:<br /><br />YEAR 1    4,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; YEAR 4  38,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;YEAR 7  38,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;YEAR 10  Near 0
<p>YEAR 2  21,000 &nbsp; YEAR 5  38,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;YEAR 8  22,000<br /><br />YEAR 3  32,000 &nbsp; YEAR 6  38,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;YEAR 9    6,000<br /><br />This animal colony shall be divided into at least two (2), approximately equal, separate segments.  Each segment shall be maintained behind a totally independent barrier, specific pathogen- and parasite free, for the entire contract period.  Both segments shall specifically be helicobacter-negative.  The purpose of colony division is to insure the survival of at least one half of the colony in the event of pathologic breach of a barrier, mechanical failure of environmental maintenance systems, or accidental disaster such as fire, or flood.  Total independence of colony segments therefore, means separation of buildings, power systems and back-up systems, environmental controls (heat, air conditioning, and air filtration) and breeding stock.  Each barrier shall have an independent back-up generator and alarm system in case of loss of power.<br /><br />The Contractor shall acquire foundation stock for two (2) inbred strains of rats from a stock center identified by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and shall re-derive the stock by caesarian section or embryo transfer under barrier conditions. After re-derivation, testing to confirm genetic purity and Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) health status shall be performed on the foundation colony, and breeding colonies will be established for the two (2) inbred strains and one (1) derivative hybrid strain. Rats will be entered into the aging colony at levels defined in the contract Statement of Work (SOW), currently a total of 1440 rats per month (the hybrid strain account for approximately 35% of the total entry levels).<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide discrete production space for each colony segment within the barrier or isolation area for that segment.  This space shall be defined within each unit, and the animals held therein until the scheduled removal or expiration of the animals.  Facilities set aside for these colonies shall be provided with all equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to maintain these animals effectively within the barrier enclosure in a stable condition and environment. Since this is an aging colony, the Contractor must be prepared to house the animals for up to 2-3 years.<br /><br />Rats shall be provided with sterilized laboratory animal feed, the formulation of which is consistent with NIH31 (Rader et al., 1986, J. Nutrition 116:1777-88) diet with regard to ingredients, both in kind and amount.  The following items shall be controlled within the ranges specified: temperature (72-79oF), humidity (40-70%), light cycles (12/12 hours), air circulation (0.25m/hr/animal) and filtration (HEPA), and water chlorination and acidification (water shall be chlorinated and the pH controlled so as to not exceed pH 7.3 and 7-8 PPM chlorination at discharge end).  A maximum of 25% re-circulated air within the barrier is allowed.  Current ILAR (http://www.nap.edu/books/0309053773/html/index.html) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm) for breeding, care and maintenance of laboratory rats shall apply where specifications have not been detailed. Rats shall be monitored weekly for signs of fighting or morbidity.<br /><br />Semi-annual genetic monitoring of the breeding colonies and quarterly health monitoring of the aging colonies shall be performed and reported to the COR as well as be included in the semi-annual progress reports. Genetic monitoring shall be accomplished by a panel of microsatellite markers that distinguish the inbred strains. Health monitoring shall include external exams for parasites, microbiology, serology, and histology.<br /><br />The Contractor shall ship the rats to investigators upon authorization from the COR, providing secure shipping crates, food and water sources, and climate-controlled transport. Shipment via dedicated, climate-controlled truck is the preferred method.   The Contractor shall weekly provide an inventory of the aging colony in a format approved by the COR.<br /><br /><strong>REPORTS/DELIVERABLES</strong></p>
<p>The following reports will be required: <br />(1) Post re-derivation Health and Genetic Monitoring Report;<br />(2) Monthly Breeding Colony Development Report;<br />(3) Semi-Annual Progress Report;<br />(4) Weekly Inventory Report;<br />(5) Quarterly Health Monitoring Reports;<br />(6) Genetic Monitoring Reports;<br />(7) Individual Postmortem Reports;<br />(8) Final Report; and <br />(9) Contract Closeout.<br /><br /><strong>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS<br /><br /></strong>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 112990 with a size standard of $0.75 million.<br /><br />This proposed acquisition was previously publicized under sources sought notices HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-15-007 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-SBSS-15-007.<br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) is hereby requesting information about potential sources for technical services to support the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) Simulation Laboratory Facilities (SimLabs). The work will be performed primarily at ARC, Moffett Field, California. <p> This notice has two purposes: <p> 1) To request information on capabilities of potential offerors to provide the services described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) in order to determine if this will be a small business set-aside. Information received as a result of this notice will be considered by the Government and used for acquisition planning purposes only. An interested parties list will be posted. <p> 2) To request information from interested parties regarding their preferred contracting approach to provide the services described in the attached draft SOW. <p> Background <p> The Simulation Laboratory Facilities are unique national research and development facilities dedicated to providing researchers with high-fidelity environments in which to conduct simulated flight and air traffic management research and to advance the state-of-the-art of simulation technology.  Researchers use the facilities to investigate a variety of topics ranging from the design of new aircraft guidance and control systems to the human factors implications of new or existing flight deck displays, airspace operations, air traffic control and automation. In-house projects and experiments are conducted to develop new simulator systems and subsystems, improve simulation systems, develop advanced engineering techniques to improve the fidelity and validity of simulation programs, and incorporate the latest technology into simulation systems.  <p> The Simulation Laboratory Facilities are primarily comprised of the Crew-Vehicle Systems Research Facility (CVSRF), the Distributed Simulation Research Laboratory (DSRL), the Vertical Motion Simulation Complex (VMSC), FutureFlight Central (FFC), and the 210 ATC Lab. The Simulation Laboratory Facilities also provides an Air Traffic Control Laboratory. <p> The simulation facilities are used by NASA programs, other NASA Centers, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Defense, the National Transportation Safety Board, other government organizations, industry and universities. <p> Responses <p> Interested parties having the required specialized capabilities/qualifications to support some or all of the work described in the draft SOW are requested to respond to this RFI with an information package. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and must be clearly marked. <p> The information package is requested as two separate files: Statement of Capabilities and Contracting Approach. <p> A.	Statement of Capabilities <p> Responses to this portion of the information package are limited to 10 pages and must include the following: <p> 1)	Company name, address, and website (if applicable). 2)	Name, phone number, and e-mail of designated point of contact. 3)	Whether your company is Large business, Small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a)set-aside small business, HUBZone small business, Woman-owned small business, Veteran-owned small business, HBCU/MI, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned small business for NAICS code 541330 size standard $4.5M. 4)	Your companys capability in each of the technical areas (see Requirements, SOW section 3.0). For each technical area, indicate what percentage of the effort you would perform, and any proposed teaming arrangements, if any. 5)	A list of relevant work performed in the past five (5) years, including contract type, contract number, technical description, dollar amount, period of performance, and a customer reference name, phone number, and email. <p> B.	Contracting Approach <p> Responses to this portion of the information package do not have a page limit. In order to enhance competition and provide business opportunities, the Government is requesting feedback in the following areas for consideration during acquisition planning: <p> 1)	Socio-economic considerations: ARC is interested in your comments on establishing subcontracting goals for Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned small business, Small-Disadvantaged Business, Women-owned small business, Veteran-owned small business, Historically Black Colleges and Universities/ Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI), and HUBZone small business. 2)	Use of Incentives: To determine the appropriate contract type (contract types for consideration, alone or in a hybrid combination, include both Fixed-Price and Cost-Reimbursement contracts, such as FFP, FPI, FPAF, CPFF, and CPIF), the Government is soliciting input from interested parties regarding why a particular contract type or combination of contract types might be more appropriate (benefits and impediments), how that proposed contract type would affect costs and how you would propose; as well as answers to the following questions: a.	Performance incentives: Please provide your view regarding types of fee, options, and/or other appropriate incentives for contractor performance. b.	In a mixed-team (Government/Contractor) environment, how would you propose to measure factors such as the technical/cost/ schedule performance, risk mitigation, employee and asset safety and security, innovative best practices, quality of service to users, responsiveness to changing requirements and budget, identifying opportunities for technical and administrative improvement, or cost? 3)	Technical Information: In addition to the SOW, what type of technical information would you like to see with a potential solicitation (e.g., sample tasks)? 4)	Contract Content/Structure: Do you have any suggestions or examples of restructuring or simplifications in the technical area descriptions in the draft SOW as well as other types of additional information that would improve understanding or clarity of requirements and terms and conditions? <p> The information packages are due no later than November 12, 2015 and shall be submitted via email only to <a href="mailto:bethany.a.mcclave@nasa.gov">bethany.a.mcclave@nasa.gov </a> . In all responses, please reference notice number NNA16568278L. Please submit files in PDF format. <p> Written questions should also be directed to <a href="mailto:bethany.a.mcclave@nasa.gov">bethany.a.mcclave@nasa.gov </a> . Verbal questions will not be accepted. <p> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit NASA to contract for any supply or service. Further, NASA is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that NASA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. The responses to this RFI may be used to assist NASA in developing a statement of work and evaluation criteria in support of a future procurement. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.FedBizOpps.gov). It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

HOWEVER THE SAMPLING ACCEPTANCE NUMBER SHALL BE REDUCED TO ZERO (0). EVEN THOUGH THE ACCEPTANCE LEVEL IS ELIMINATED; THE SAMPLE SIZE REMAINS THE SAME. UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN THE OEM OR MILITARY DRAWING,<br />SPECIFICATION, STANDARD, OR QUALITY ASSURANCE PROVISIONS (QAPs) CHARACTERISTICS CLASSIFIED AS CRITICAL, MAJOR AND MINOR SHALL HAVE AN ASSIGNED AQL OF 0.10, 1.0, AND 4.0 RESPECTIVELY.

<p>REFERENCE NUMBER ZD071</p>
<p>Configuration Change Management - Engineering Change Proposal, Requests for Variance (Deviation or Waiver) February 2015<br />1. Requirements<br />A. The Configuration Change Management section of SAE EIA-649-1 Configuration Management Requirement for Defense Contracts, Paragraph 3.3, shall be used for Configuration Control of material purchased under this contract.<br />B. Furnished item(s) shall conform to the approved configuration requirements/revision specified, unless a Pre-Production Request for Variance (deviation) or a Post-Production Request for Variance (waiver), is processed and approved as provided by Paragraph 3 in this Standard Text Object (STO). Hereafter, the term #Request for Variance (RFV) # will also include Requests for Deviations and Waivers.</p>
<p>2. The definitions from EIA-649-1 apply to items being procured under this solicitation/contract, with the following clarification of Deviation &amp; Waiver:<br />A. Pre-Production RFV (previously known as deviation) requests permission to produce a product that does not conform to contract requirements/documentation for a limited amount of time and for specified effectivity. (A deviation differs from an engineering change in that an approved engineering change requires corresponding revision of the item's current approved configuration documentation, whereas a deviation does not.).<br />B. Post-Production RFV (previously known as waiver) requests approval of product found during manufacture, or after having been submitted for Government inspection or acceptance, that departs from specified requirements, but nevertheless is considered suitable for use "as is" or after repair by an approved method.</p>
<p>3. Contractor responsibilities.<br />A. An Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) is used to make permanent changes in the Government technical data package (TDP). Pending approval of an ECP, contractual relief should be requested in writing by the Contractor using a RFV.<br />B. Refer to FAR Part 48 Value Engineering for cost saving improvements to the Technical Data Package (TDP).<br />C. All ECPs submitted by the Contractor will be deemed routine.<br />If the Contractor considers an ECP as an emergency or urgent; they shall include in their ECP submittal an explanation and all applicable supporting documentation. All ECPs will be reviewed for a determination on criticality, and, if concurred to be an emergency, the appropriate processing time-frame negotiated with the ESAs will be followed and the Contractor will be notified of anticipated response time.<br />D. For ECPs, Specification Change Notices (SCNs) or RFV, the Contractor must submit the applicable documentation listed in sub-paragraphs D.(1) through D.(4)to the Administrative Contracting Officer(ACO), with an information copy to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO). Failure to submit a complete legible package may result in return of the ECP/RFV without processing.</p>
<p>(1) Documentation listed in Paragraph 3.3.1 (for ECPs), 3.3.2 (RFV), 3.3.3 (for SCNs) or 3.3.4 (for Notices of Revision (NORs)) of the latest revision of EIA-649-1.<br />(2) DD Form 1692 (current revision) for ECP.<br />(3) DD Form 1694 (current revision) for RFV.<br />(4) DD Form 1695 (current revision) for NOR.</p>
<p>4. DLAs responsibilities:<br />A. Upon receipt of the ECP or RFV, the PCO will ensure that the applicable product specialist receives the copy from DCMA.<br />B. Within five (5) working days from the date of receipt of the Contractor's ECP or RFV from DCMA, the PS must submit the requests and any supporting documentation via a 339 to the appropriate Engineering Support Activity (ESA), when applicable.<br />C. Routine ECPs will be processed within 90 days from receipt by the ESA. RFVs will be evaluated and processed within 30 days from receipt by the ESA or as negotiated with the ESA.<br />(1) The contractor will be notified in writing of approval by the return of an approved copy of the ECP or RFV. Approval will be reflected by signature of the contracting activity or a review activity specifically identified in the contract.<br />(2) The contractor will be notified in writing of disapproval including reason(s) for disapproval.</p>
<p>5. For an approved RFV or an approved ECP, when the request affects the Contract, a modification will be issued to the contract incorporating the applicable requirement changes. Only a Contracting Officer is authorized to issue a modification incorporating the approved RFV and/or ECP.</p>
<p>6. Questions regarding the status of previously submitted ECP or RFV should be directed to the PCO.</p>
<p>7. The submission of an ECP or RFV by the Contractor does not affect the required delivery date of the contract. If a delivery date change is needed, it must be negotiated with the Contracting Officer and documented via modification to the contract.</p>
<p>8. The period of time for evaluation and approval/disapproval of an ECP and/or a RFV, as specified in Paragraph 4. C., shall not constitute excusable delay in the performance of this Contract by the Contractor or in any way relieve the contractor from compliance with the contract delivery schedule. The submission of an ECP and/or RFV by the Contractor shall not preclude the Government from exercising its rights under any clause of the Contract. (End)</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE. The following information is provided to assist the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAVAIR) Lakehurst, NJ, in conducting market research of industry to identify currently available options to meet U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps requirements for a turboshaft engine dynamometer (load absorber) and torque measurement system.
<p>The torque meter and dynamometer must be capable of speeds between 0-22,000 RPM (operational) and 0-25,000 (transient) RPM as well as absorb/measure 0-650 lb-ft at 22,000 RPM (operational) and up to 750 lb-ft at 22,000 RPM (transient). The dynamometer must be able to load the engine throughout the entire operational range of the engine, including engine start/shutdown, idle and performance. The dynamometer and torque system must be able to operate in temperatures between -20&deg;F - 120&deg;F. The dynamometer and torque system must be able to operate in an outdoor or indoor environment which may include snow, ice, rain, high winds, sand, salt spray and direct sunlight. When not in operation, the dynamometer and torque system may be exposed to the same elements and must remain in a ready-condition with minimal preventative maintenance. The dynamometer and torque system instrumentation must be able to be field calibrated by U.S. Navy personnel with existing standards without special tools or OEM personnel. The dynamometer and torque system must be able to operate using 120 VAC 60 Hz power and/or 28 VDC. The torque meter and dynamometer may not drive any changes to existing support equipment or engine operation.</p>
<p>The dynamometer must use air as the working fluid and all necessary ancillary gear (lubrication systems, cooling systems, etc.) must be self-contained. The dynamometer must be able to be operated through its entire operational range from a conditioned space located approximately 75 feet away. The dynamometer should contain instrumentation necessary for safe operation that can be read by a Government-furnished data acquisition system. The dynamometer must be able to exhaust working air vertically up a 30-foot augmenter for indoor applications. The maximum footprint is approximately 50 inches high, 42 inches wide and 36 inches deep. The dynamometer must be mounted on four feet located on a rectangular pad with dimensions 13.5 inches by 28.7 inches between mounting hole centerlines. The dynamometer input shaft centerline must be located 24.75" from the test stand mount pad.<br /><br />The torque system should be capable of +/- 0.4% accuracy (torque) and +/- 10 RPM (speed). The torque system may be integral to the dynamometer or standalone. The torque system shall be self-contained and not require any ancillary gear for operation. The torque system must be able to interface to a General Electric CT7-8A6 turboshaft engine, including its output drive and bolt flange, and be able to support the weight of the front of the engine. An electronic readout/circuitry may be mounted in a conditioned space approximately 75 feet away. The torque system must contain electrical outputs that allow a Government-furnished data acquisition system to read speed, torque, and any other instrumentation required for safe operation or data analysis. <br /><br />Information on one or both requirements may be submitted. Please provide the following information about products being proposed for either requirement by your company:<br />1) Describe in general your product.<br />2) Discuss critical information and performance parameters associated with your product: speed range, power ratings, accuracy, any reliability data, and any other salient characteristics.<br />3) Describe any performance tests that have been performed on the product being proposed. Provide test results and data if available. Performance tests include environmental testing, low load testing, high load testing, vibration tests, critical speed testing, sound level testing, etc.<br />4) Provide information about your company/organization including: brief description of your company/organization, point of contact, phone number, e-mail address, website information, DUNS Number, CAGE Code, and Business Size Status for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of this RFI.<br />5) A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) is requested for 3 units.<br />6) Provide any commercial pamphlets or relevant additional information.</p>
<p>THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) BUT RATHER A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) from industry that will allow the Government to identify interested sources capable of meeting the requirements as stated in this synopsis. No Solicitation exists. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of the effort mentioned above. All data received in response to this RFI, marked or designated as corporate or proprietary, will be fully protected from release outside the Government. The Government will not release any information marked with a proprietary legend received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future associated RFP that may be issued. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website: www.fbo.gov. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.</p>
<p>Responses should be submitted electronically to the designated Contract Specialist, Sarah McCarty, in Microsoft Word format or Portable Document Format (PDF) at the following e-mail address: sarah.mccarty@navy.mil with the subject line "Dynamometer and Torque System RFI Response." TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>

All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to
ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their
possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The
Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security
Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security
Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security,
and Preparedness.

d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum
extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA
policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and
detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting
problems of communication, control, data protection; and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an
evaluation factor.

e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee
working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or
subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or
subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.


VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE

a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or
administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance
or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other
way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the
contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d)
(1).

b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the
contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA
requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed
to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is
returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right
to conduct onsite inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security
controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in
compliance with VA directive requirements.

c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy
information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this
contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a
contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration
(NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its
Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA
Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data
destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days
of termination of the contract.

d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA
information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information
confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or
information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or
Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to
implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and
policies in this contract.

e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and
necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on
contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data
used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for
restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and
security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the
contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate
actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an
agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an
encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or
exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.

j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the
contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations:
(i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written
approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries
about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.

k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records
protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38
U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia,
alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the
contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned
information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to
the VA contracting officer for response.

1. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive
information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the
contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly
basis and provide it to the COTR.


INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE

a. For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA
facilities, contractors/subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with
all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks.
This includes conducting compliant risk assessments, routine vulnerability scanning, system patching and
change management procedures, and the completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system.
The contractor's security control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA
systems. A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COTR and approved by VA
Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA's network
involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.

b. Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally
Identifiable Information (PIO, as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and
approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by
or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these
controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII.

c. Outsourcing (contractor facility, contractor equipment or contractor staff) of systems or network
operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and
accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance with VA Handbook
6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office.
Government-owned (government facility or government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third
party or business partner networks require memorandums of understanding and interconnection
agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks.

d. The contractor/subcontractor's system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to
the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA. Any deficiencies noted
during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA's
POA&M management process. The contractor/subcontractor must use VA's POA&M process to
document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies,
procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected
within the timeframes approved by the government. Contractor/subcontractor procedures are subject to
periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General. The
physical security aspects associated with contractor/subcontractor activities must also be subject to such
assessments. If major changes to the system occur that may affect the privacy or security of the data or the
system, the C&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook
6500.3. This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan,
Contingency Plan). The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary.

e. The contractor/subcontractor must conduct an annual self-assessment on all systems and outsourced
services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the
COTR. The government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using government personnel or
another contractor/subcontractor. The contractor/subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action
(this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost.

f. VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/subcontractor-owned
equipment or software on VA's network. If non-VA VA Handbook 6500.6, Contract Security APPENDIX C 8 owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract. All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA-approved
configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches. Owners of
approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the
non-VA owned OE. 

g. All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to
store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1,
Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return
of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the
contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.)
used by the contractors/subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for
sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been
disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the
contract.

h. Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.)
with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other
purposes. The options are:

(1) Vendor must accept the system without the drive;

(2) VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the
original drive at time of turn-in; or

(3) VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of
purchase.

(4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with
medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;

(a) The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive
information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and

(b) Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible
without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is
recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable
media sanitization specifications need to be pre-approved and described in the purchase order or contract.

 (c) A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be
removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the
documentation.


SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to,
loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures.
The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO
and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the
contractor/subcontractor has access.

b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall
identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how,
when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other
information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have
discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such
information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach.
Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must
concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction,
including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its
subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority
responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with
any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA
information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any
incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.


LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. Â§5725, a contract may require access to sensitive
personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data
breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under
this contract.

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the
Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA Handbook 6500.6, Contract Security APPENDIX C 10 must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

c_ Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the
following:

(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);

(2) Description of the event, including:

(a) date of occurrence;
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth,
home address, account number, disability code
(c) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
(d) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
(e) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of
protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
(f) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
(g) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible
to and usable by unauthorized persons);
(h) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(i) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(j) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy
Incidents, as appropriate; and
(k) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of
identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.

d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for
paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $ 37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of
providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:

(1) Notification;
(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant
credit bureau reports;
(3) Data breach analysis;
(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to
assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING
On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-days' notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated,
maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The
government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced
assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.


TRAINING

a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA
information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its
systems:

(I) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for
compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and
information systems; VA Handbook 6500.6, Contract Security APPENDIX C 12
(2) Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually
complete required security training;
(3) Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy
training; and
(4) Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel
with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the
contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security
training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security
Training Requirements.]

b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COTR a copy of the training
certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee
within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.
c. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the
timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges
and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

<DESC>J&amp;A Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to award a sole source contract to General Dynamics Mission Systems (GMDS), 8201 E. McDowell Road, Scottsdale, AZ 85257, for three years. This contract will provide the technical effort to split the current system into a Radio Subsystem and Direction Finding/Digital Selective Calling (DF/DSC) Subsystem as well as continue sustainment of the legacy Rescue 21 Coastal system.</p>
<p>The legacy R21 Coastal system provides simultaneous VHF/UHF communications, direction finding (DF), and digital selective calling (DSC) functionality for the Coast Guard to communicate with maritime users in the continental United States, Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Sustainment of the legacy R21 Coastal system includes all management, supervision, engineering services, personnel, labor, materials, and equipment required to perform organizational and depot level maintenance, including information assurance, system design maintenance, engineering escalation, technology refreshment, and obsolescence management.</p>
<p>The legacy R21 Coastal system consists of the following:</p>
<p>&bull; 32 CG Sector (SCC) equipment suites (Backroom servers &amp; (3) operator consoles per Sector)<br />&bull; 167 CG Station equipment suites with (1) operator console per Station/MSO/MSU<br />&bull; 258 Remote Fixed Facilities (RFF's) with typical configuration of 5 VHF transceivers, 1 UHF transceiver, voice &amp; data servers, digital processors, data switches, RF filters, RF interference mitigation, Direction Finding, equipment huts, tower, tower lighting, environmental sensor, antennas, and standby power generation subsystems.<br />&bull; 4 Disaster Recovery (DR) mobile equipment suites (portable RFF, portable tower/antenna, portable satellite communication suites, &amp; portable generator suites)<br />&bull; 1 Disaster Recovery (DR) R21-C Sector Command Center equipment suite at CG OSC Martinsburg W VA<br />&bull; 1 Rescue 21 Coastal Operator Training Simulation suite with 60 student work stations at TRACEN Petaluma, CA</p>
<p>Sustainment of the legacy R21-Coastal system shall ensure the R21 critical functions listed below are provided at the specified availability, measured monthly within a Coast Guard Sector Area-of-Operational Responsibility (AOR).</p>
<p>Rescue 21 <br />Critical Functions Operational Availability<br />Receipt of distress and emergency alerts (VHF-FM Ch 16) 99.5%<br />Digital Selective Calling (DSC) data 99.5%<br />VHF-FM Maritime Voice Communications 99.5%<br />UHF Voice Communications 99.5%<br />Protected Communications 99.5%<br />Caller Position Location. Single Line-of-Bearing (LOB) Information) 99.5%<br />Archiving/Recording Functions 99.5%</p>
<p>The USCG will technically refresh soon-to-be obsolete radios at its 258 Remote Fixed Facilities (RFFs) during the three year period, replacing analogue and proprietary interfaces with Digital Fixed Station Interface (DFSI) radios conforming to the TIA-102.BAHA standard. These radios will be competitively procured by the Coast Guard. Radios to be replaced include mixed-mode UHF (qty. 1), mixed mode VHF (qty. 2), a dedicated Channel 16 VHF Guard radio, and a dedicated Channel 70 VHF DSC radio.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the three year contract, the Coast Guard will award a follow-on five year contract to GDMS to support CG Sectors that have not been transitioned to the new Radio Subsystem and assist in cut-over of the Radio Control Subsystem and DF/DSC Subsystem at all 32 USCG Sectors. Deployment and installation of the Radio Control Subsystem to all USCG Sectors will be competitively procured. The radio control subsystems for the USCG Sectors will also conform to open standards and will be competitively procured. Support of the Sectors will transition from the sole source arrangement with GDMS to the awardee of a concurrent competitive support contract that will increase in size during this five year period as transition progresses.</p>
<p>The DF/DSC Subsystem, designed to correlate direction finding lines of bearing and received audio while reducing spurious reports, will continue to be supported by GDMS as it remains proprietary to GDMS. This subsystem hosts the proprietary source code upon which the GDMS R21-C technical solution is based.</p>
<p>Sustainment of the existing Rescue 21 Coastal System will be sole sourced during the three year period due to its integration with GDMS support services and the proprietary nature of critical software elements. The existing Customer Care Center is integrated with user authentication, support, and depot services critical to operations. Status of the existing system is monitored, and corrections made remotely, using a proprietary software system. Media Services software, which manages all calls and is found in all elements of the system, is also proprietary to GDMS. The existing Customer Care Center is highly integrated with engineering, support, and depot services. Availability of critical capabilities must continue to be maintained at the 99.5% level (receipt of distress and emergency alerts, DSC alerts, VHF-FM maritime voice communications, UHF voice communications, position location and audio correlation) or the 95% level (protected communications) during the eight-year transition period while the Rescue 21-C system is technically transformed to a system that can largely be supported through competition.</p>
<p>Current Government owned system technical information is limited to site drawings, COTS parts lists, high-level hardware and software design descriptions, operator manuals, and a system-level maintenance manual. Complete source code and detailed information on integrated support systems are not available. Note that system maintenance is highly dependent upon remote software image loading and equipment configuration provided by the Customer Care Center. Software and hardware changes to the legacy R21 Coastal system, which are necessary to meet system obsolescence and Coast Guard information assurance requirements, are validated prior to field deployment using three government-owned &lsquo;development' and &lsquo;test' equipment suites located in Scottsdale, AZ. An additional test suite in Scottsdale AZ is connected to the a &lsquo;Test Domain' on the Coast Guard's private data network (i.e. CGONE) to ensure proposed information assurance patches and upgrades to the R21 Coastal system do not adversely impact CG enterprise services prior to installation of these changes at CG Sectors.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is issued solely to determine whether there are any other sources that could meet the Coast Guard's technical and schedule requirements for modification and sustainment of the Rescue 21 Coastal system. The Coast Guard believes that utilizing another Contractor to modify and sustain the existing system prior to this planned transition would cause unacceptable delays in the transition to competition and would negatively impact the availability of a safety-of-life system, putting lives at risk.</p>
<p>Companies that believe they have the capability to sustain the existing system, with no degradation in availability, must submit a capability statement detailing how they would gain access to the support baselines and proprietary monitoring system, or replicate those services. They must detail how all modification and sustainment capabilities will be fully operational by July 2016. Companies must also detail how they would gain access to proprietary GDMS software elements, or reproduce existing software, to support division into a Radio Subsystem and DF/DSC Subsystem. Companies must explain their design, integration, verification, testing and certification functions and provide a timeline to meet the schedule; they must also explain how an otherwise acceptable solution from the company would be price competitive with GDMS. The capability statement shall also include the company's Dun and Bradstreet number, a discussion of any previous experience similar to this requirement, and a point of contact in the event the Coast Guard requires additional information.<br />This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Proposals submitted based on this notice will not be accepted. Capability statements received prior to the closing date and time will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is possible.</p>

<DESC>This special notice synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. Respondents will not be notified of the results. All responses will be treated as Source Selection Information. All vendor information will be protected to certify procurement integrity. Description: <P> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) (UAS-NAS) Project within the Integrated Aviation Systems Program of the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate is soliciting information through this Request for Information (RFI) for a Surrogate UA in support of the Projects Flight Test Series (FT) 4. The principle objective of this RFI is for the Project to receive information from the Northrop Grumman Corporation Firebird Project on the following: 1. A Surrogate UA capability. 2. Availability of the Surrogate UA for the duration of the FT4 schedule. 3. Upgrades to the Surrogate UA to support connectivity to the NASA Research Ground Control Station (RGCS). <p> Background: <p> The UAS-NAS Project plan is to contribute research findings to reduce technical barriers related to the safety and operational challenges associated with enabling routine UAS access to the NAS in technology areas aligned with current NASA expertise and capabilities.  The Project was planned for two phases.	The first phase included development and integration of system-level key concepts, technologies, and/or procedures based on UAS stakeholder/community needs.  Phase 1 also included refinement of those needs as part of defining the specifics of the Phase 2 research portfolio. Phase 2 of the Project includes demonstration of the integrated technologies in operationally relevant environments. The technology areas selected for Phase 2 include detect and avoid (DAA), communications, human systems integration (HSI), and Integrated Tests and Evaluation (IT&E) [Live, Virtual, and Constructive  Distributed Environment (LVC-DE) development]. This selection was accomplished through a fairly rigorous research selection process, that not only considered existing NASA expertise and capabilities, but also Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), RTCA Special Committee (SC)-228, and UAS community research needs.  The Projects Phase 2 research activities contribute to the development of SC-228 Phase 1 Final DAA and command and control (C2) Data Link minimum operational performance standards (MOPS), as well as providing foundational research associated with full integration of UAS into the NAS.  The Project will contribute to the development of the Phase 1 DAA MOPS through the conduct of operationally representative flight evaluations of the DAA alerting and maneuver guidance technologies employing a Research Ground Control Station (RGCS) and operational UAS test subject pilots (MQ-1/9, RQ-4). In addition, these flight tests will provide increased confidence in the final Phase 1 MOPS recommendations by validating human in the loop part-task 6 simulation results. <p> Requirements: <p> The UAS-NAS Project has a need for a Surrogate UA to fulfill the requirements of its Flight Test Series 4 (FT4) full mission activity in support of NASA research and to inform the SC 228 Phase 1 DAA MOPS. <p> Surrogate UA capability <p> 1.Waypoint Navigation (autonomously fly a series of waypoints) <p> 2.Vehicle flight path controllable via the autopilot from commands uplinked from the NASA RGCS a.Heading hold b.Altitude/Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI) hold <p>i.VSI hold up to 2500 fpm c.Go-to-Waypoint/Fly-to-Waypoint <p> 2.C2 interface with the NASA RGCS (which hosts the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Vigilant Spirit Control Station (VSCS) software that is STANAG 4586 compliant) a.Uplink auto-pilot commands b.Downlink ownship state data including aircraft attitude c.Downlink command acknowledgments in order to synchronize the VSCS d.Latency from GCS pilot command execution to ownship state feedback to the GCS pilot &#8804; 2 sec <p> 3.Stable C2 RF link performance out to 60 nmi <p> 4.Capability for onboard safety pilot to override and take over aircraft control at any time <p> 5.Required Aircraft Equipage a.ADS-B In/Out (1090ES)       i.Downlink traffic/intruder state data to the NASA RGCS including Flight ID/Call Signs b.Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) II i.v7.1 ii.Downlink Resolution Advisory (RA) and maneuver coordination/Vertical Resolution Advisory Complement (VRC) messages to the NASA RGCS c.Senso fusion algorithm to combine sensor tracks d.Onboard recording of UTC referenced raw surveillance track data prior to any sensor fusion algorithm <p> 6.Highly Desired Equipage a.

<DESC><br />Project Manager Soldier Weapons (PM SW) will host a Small Arms Fire Control (SAFC) Industry Day from 1 to 3 September 2015 at Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey. This notice is for planning purposes only and constitutes a request to exchange information pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201. The SAFC Industry Day will encourage the exchange of information between the Government and industry to gauge the knowledge and practicality of SAFC capabilities. The Government intends to use this forum to better refine future requirements, not to elicit trade secrets.
<p>This announcement should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this event. Offerors are directed to NOT submit proposals at this time.</p>
<p>NOTE: The Government will not be responsible for any expense incurred by a vendor's decision to participate in the SAFC Industry Day. All travel and other associated costs are to be assumed by the interested vendor.</p>
<p><strong>INDUSTRY DAY FORMAT</strong></p>
<p>The SAFC Industry Day will start at 8:30 am Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 1 September 2015, with check-in beginning at 8:00 am. An information briefing on the upcoming SAFC Capability Development Document (CDD) for all interested vendors is scheduled the morning of 1 September. After the briefing, one-on-one 20-30 minutes private sessions between individual vendors and the Government will be scheduled for vendors who had requested them. Vendors may ask any questions or provide any comments as a flow of knowledge and ideas is strongly encouraged. Participants will receive their scheduled time slots with their welcome packet the week of 10 August 2015.</p>
<p>All vendor information will be treated confidentially. Vendors will not be permitted to give sales pitches or giveaways. Use of cameras, tape recorders, or other recording devices will not be allowed any time during the SAFC Industry Day. Vendor hardware is permitted only for demonstration purposes.</p>
<p><strong>SMALL ARMS FIRE CONTROL</strong></p>
<p>The objective of the SAFC effort is to develop an advanced weapons sight with integrated fire control (i.e., an integrated display, ballistics calculation, rangefinder, and on-board sensors) that is optimized for use in three key application areas: Squad (dismounted rifleman), Crew-Served (mounted machine gun), and Precision (sniper). The SAFC variants are expected to provide an appropriate magnification for target recognition at the maximum effective range of the host weapon platform, determine target range and firing conditions, and provide an adjusted aimpoint for improved accuracy. The Squad and Crew-Served applications should have a reflex capability for rapid target engagement at close range. Variants are also expected to have the ability to communicate target information with a Soldier-borne network.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTIONS TO INDUSTRY (please be prepared to discuss during the 1-on-1 sessions)<br /></strong><br />1. Based on the Government's above expectation for SAFC, is there an existing prototype system which may meet this requirement? Is there a near-term product which may meet this requirement? It is understood that some development may be required to achieve specific performance parameters not laid out in this document.</p>
<p>2. One required attribute of SAFC is a degraded capability in a no-power situation. In this situation, a passive Direct View Optic (DVO) with a reticle is required. What approach do you have to provide this capability?</p>
<p>3. One desired attribute of SAFC is the ability to accurately determine compass heading. Do you have any technologies that allow for heading determination in the non-magnetically neutral environment of a small arms weapon platform? If so, what type of accuracy are you able to achieve?</p>
<p>4. One desired attribute of SAFC is to optimize modularity for service and maintenance purposes and also for future upgrades without returning the system to the factory. What approach do you have to provide this capability?</p>
<p>5. A reflexive fire capability is crucial, particularly in the Squad application (this is different from a unity power optic because a reflex optic typically has infinite eye relief). What approach do you have to provide reflex capability with minimal impact on rapidly achieving high magnification?</p>
<p>6. The Government anticipates using its own (Government developed and owned) ballistic solver in future fire control systems to allow for updates based on new ammunition. Future industry participants will be provided a Software Development Kit (SDK) to help integrate this solver on their systems. Will software for your system be handled in-house or be subcontracted?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTIONS FROM INDUSTRY</strong></p>
<p>Questions asked by industry, with corresponding answers from the Government, during this three-day event will be posted on FBO.gov for all parties to read after the event is concluded.</p>
<p>NOTE: Questions will be posted anonymously, and all sources will remain unknown.</p>
<p>REMINDER: Questions during the event will be restricted solely to the SAFC program; questions on funding availability, prospective RFP timelines, or other contractual questions will not be answered.</p>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Redstone announces an open season which will begin on&nbsp;13 October 2015, to restructure existing teams for all domains under the Expedited Professional and Engineering Support Services (EXPRESS) program. EXPRESS is a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) program based upon the use of GSA Federal Supply Schedules for acquiring advisory and assistance services (including all supervision, labor, incidental materials, and travel). These services may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training, and technical and management support. The complete scopes of work for each domain may be reviewed on the website listed below. Competitively awarded BPAs have been established in each of the EXPRESS domains as follows: Business &amp; Analytical (5), Logistics (7), Programmatic (3) each, and Technical (15). The BPAs were established with a provision for an annual open season in which the government may add additional BPA teams or allow existing Prime Contractors/Team Leaders the opportunity to restructure existing teams. The purpose of the current open season will allow the existing EXPRESS Prime Contractors/Team Leaders to restructure existing teams by adding new team members and subcontractors, deleting current team members and subcontractors, and/or revising teaming arrangement(s) to respond to future EXPRESS task order requirements. Please note that EXPRESS will no longer be tracking subcontractors at the BPA level. Parties interested in participating as a team member (GSA Schedule required), subcontractor (no GSA Schedule required) or providing incidental materials (GSA Schedule preferred), are encouraged to pursue appropriate arrangements with the current EXPRESS Prime Contractor/Team Leaders. A list of the current EXPRESS Prime Contractors/Team Leaders may be found on the EXPRESS website located at the following link:
<p>http://www.acc.army.mil/contractingcenters/acc-rsa/Express.html</p>
<p>This website also contains a link to each BPA team's website for additional information. To restructure teaming relationships on existing BPAs, Prime Contractors/Team Leaders are required to submit two CD-ROMs containing the following information: A Team Matrix that identifies added/deleted team members; a revised Attachment 4 (Team File) to include rates through 2020 (ONLY if finalized rates are available on GSA schedule); a Labor Category Alignment, and a Performance Capability Team File.</p>
<p>All submitted documents shall be write-protected or read only. The formats for these documents can be found on the EXPRESS website under the Open Season link. Responses from the current Prime Contractors/Team Leaders to this open season announcement are due no later than 2:00 p.m. (CST) on 17 November 2015. Mailed copies (follow-up required) shall be addressed to: Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Redstone, ATTN: CCAM-EXP/Lauren E. Harding, Sparkman Center, Building 5303, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898. Hand deliveries will be accepted on Tuesday, 17 November, from 1:45 to 2:00 pm, CST, in the lobby of Bldg 5300.

<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY CONFERENCE

DARPA will host an Industry Day Conference in support of the Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program on November 16, 2015 at the DARPA Conference Center, 675 N. Randolph Street, Arlington, VA 22203. Check-in begins at 7:15AM and the event will end at 4:00PM.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the CDMaST program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to discuss teaming opportunities.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the CDMaST program is to demonstrate that a maritime system of systems (SoS) approach can provide increased military effectiveness, cost leverage (i.e., the cost of the opponent to counter relative to the cost of the US to deploy), and adaptability necessary to maintain US maritime superiority in contested maritime environments. The CDMaST program will develop SoS architectures for wide area, cross-domain (under, on and over the sea) surveillance and targeting of adversary ships and submarines in order to achieve maritime dominance in contested environments. 

REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register NLT close of business (5:00 pm EDT) November 9, 2015 by sending an email with the names and titles of attendees to: DARPA-BAA-16-01@darpa.mil. The email should include the name of attendees, company name, and contact phone number. 

Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 135 registrants, and no more than 3 representatives per organization.  

The Industry Day will be split into an unclassified session from 8:00AM – 12:00PM, and a SECRET session from 1:15PM – 3:45PM. Though compilation of the architecture solutions will be classified, the desire is to draw on a wide variety of inputs from unclassified sources, and performers without clearances are encouraged to attend and participate as team members. The key solicitation and program information will be conducted at the unclassified level. 

All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event. Additionally, all US Citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 104 in order to attend this conference.  Non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60 “Foreign National Visit Request”.  These forms are only required for the attendees who are attending the unclassified portion ONLY. The completed DARPA Form 104 or DARPA Form 60 must be emailed to DARPA-BAA-16-01@darpa.mil or faxed to 703-248-4936 no later than November 9, 2015. Both documents are available on the FedBizOpps website.

The SECRET session will provide background information to offer context to support the solicitation and is open only to U.S. citizens possessing a US DoD SECRET clearance or higher.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Attendees are required to pass security clearances via JPAS no later than November 9, 2015. If you are attending the SECRET session, you do NOT need to submit the DARPA Form 104 or DARPA Form 60. Please ONLY submit your clearance via JPAS. Notetaking will NOT be allowed during the classified session. 

The following information should be provided when you pass your clearance via JPAS:
DARPA POC: Adam Boyd
Purpose of Visit: CDMaST Industry Day
SMO Code: DDAAUS4

There will be an opportunity to meet individually with Dr. Jim Galambos, the CDMaST Program Manager, on Tuesday, November 17 from 9:00AM – 12:00PM at DARPA. Time slots will be 10 minutes long and will be allocated on a first come first served basis. Once timeblocks are filled, a waitlist will be available. Classified discussions are allowed ONLY for the individuals who possess a U.S. DoD SECRET clearance or higher and who have passed their clearances via JPAS for the classified session.  To request a one-on-one meeting with Dr. Galambos, please send a separate email to DARPA-BAA-16-01@darpa.mil with “One-on-One Meeting” in the subject line and include the name of attendees, company name, and contact phone number.

To request the unclassified and classified Industry Day slides, please complete the “CDMaST Industry Day Slides Request Form” found on the FedBizOpps website and email it to DARPA-BAA-16-01@darpa.mil. Requesters of classified slides must demonstrate the ability to receive DoD Collateral SECRET material.  All appropriate security safeguards must exist prior to receiving the classified slides.

The Industry Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potential related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Industry Day.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) and NDIA Central Florida Chapter Integrated Product Team (IPT) Meeting</p>

<p>Background: Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) in partnership with Central Florida Chapter of the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) has reestablished the Navy's Integrated Product Team (IPT) meetings with Industry.</p>
<p>Purpose: The purpose of the IPT is to:<br />&bull; Remove any unnecessary barriers to reasonable communication and to provide a forum, consistent with existing law and regulation that promotes responsible and constructive exchanges between NAWCTSD and Industry. <br />&bull; Identify and resolve misconceptions about NAWCTSD flexibility regarding Government-vendor communications which hinder requirement transparency<br />&bull; Seek common ground for consistency in Government-vendor communications interface<br />&bull; Provide facts and strategies to help NAWCTSD acquisition professionals benefit from Industry's knowledge and insight.</p>
<p>Rules of Engagement: The IPT Sessions are not intended to discuss any current or future Business Opportunities. For capacity reasons, please RSVP to this announcement via the email: orlo_businesssupportteam@navy.mil. Industry is requested to limit participation to two representatives per company. We highly recommend Industry send a representative experienced in the Session Topics the IPT will address. Again, the IPT's are not business development meetings. The targeted group size is 80 individuals.</p>
<p>Topic: <br />Topic for October Government/Industry IPT Meeting: "NAVAIR T&amp;E Process"<br />NAWCTSD is in the process of aligning its Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) process to be in concert with NAVAIR's weapons systems T&amp;E process. While this transition is not yet complete, NAWCTSD will brief industry representatives on the state of this effort and is looking for feedback from industry as it relates to their training systems development efforts.</p>
<p>This agenda offers an effective exchange of information in order to improve the acquisition process. National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) will help moderate these IPTs and work to keep the discussion flowing and on the subject being addressed. We look forward to your participation</p>

<DESC>A provision of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984, authorizes non competitive contracts to be performed by only one or a limited number of sources via 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2304(c) (1); Federal Acquisition Regulation<br />(FAR) &sect; 6.302-1(a) (2) (iii) (A) and (B).As such, for the purposes described hereunder and in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) authority of Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, coupled with the Authority 10 u:s.c.2304(c)(1), the Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District intends to execute, without competition, a bilateral Contract Modification under Contract W912P6-11-D-0004 (sole source, Modification P00024). The Incumbent Contractor is KOKOSING CONSTRUCTION COMPANY/O'BRIEN &amp; GERE, JV; the address for this organization is 17531 Waterford Road, Fredericktown, Ohio 43019-9561, with Company Cage Code No. 6GS86.<br />The resulting modification will implement a new Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) with a realistic quantity of an additional 3,500 tons of debris disposal in option year 4 of the contract, allowing for uninterrupted dredging operations. The provisions of the CLIN will require that debris be separated from the dredged sediment as per the existing contract specifications, so that the sediment can be pumped with water into the Confined Disposal Facility of the Indiana Harbor Canal in East Chicago, Indiana.
<p>A variety of debris is being encountered during dredging of the Indiana Harbor &amp; Canal (IHC) that requires disposal into a confined disposal facility (CDF). In the midst of the dredging operations, it has been determined that the quantity of 100 tons per year included in the solicitation, which resulted in the conformed contract bid schedule was substantially understated. Prior to dredging after contract award, the Harbor had not been dredged for over 40 years. Therefore there was no comparable data base for determining the debris to be expected at Indiana Harbor. Now that dredging has been performed under the Contact, contract records show that the debris is not uniformly distributed across the areas dredged to date and additional quantity must be disposed to ensure uninterrupted dredging operations (i.e. larger dredged quantity, vice smaller disposed debris quantity, described herein) of approximately 400,000 cubic yards per year. At this level of dredging quantity (i.e. about 400,000 cubic yards actually dredged), records indicate that the Contractor's rate of debris accumulation dictates approximately an additional 3,500 tons of debris disposal.<br />KOKOSING CONSTRUCTION COMPANY/O'BRIEN &amp; GERE, JV, the incumbent Contractor possesses an extensive breadth of capabilities. It has designed and installed a unique dredging/offloading/debris disposal system consisting of multiple components and pieces of equipment, which took over a year to design, fabricate and install. Much of the equipment was fabricated and built just for the unique dredging and disposal requirements at IHC. It has done an excellent job improving and adjusting the system based on their experience throughout the first two years of dredging. They are using the most effective and efficient crane and crane platform barge known to be available, along with the required environmental bucket available to accomplish the dredging. The 3 hopper barges to transport dredged material meet specific requirements for this project to maximize dredging and hauling times. The debris separation barge (DSB) is a state of the art piece of equipment that was specifically constructed for this project, with pumps sufficiently sized to pump sediment from the DSB to the CDF and provide adequate water coverage over the pumped sediment to avoid unacceptable air emissions. The screen used to separate sediment and debris from dredged material on the DSB has been tweaked and modified to optimize the separation process and avoid damage to pumps. The hydraulic excavator, the two front-end loaders and the container box with Government furnished crane utilized to accomplish the disposal of debris from the DSB into the CDF is the most efficient method known.</p>
<p>One of the key tasks performed under this contract include the dredged material being transported by barge to the CDF where the debris must be separated from the dredged material so that the remaining sediment can be pumped hydraulically into the CDF. The debris collected during mechanical dredging activities and separated from the sediment must then be mechanically disposed of into the CDF. It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have a separate contract to handle the disposal of only debris in excess of the 100 tons provided in the original contract award. Therefore, this contractual requirement is only obtainable from a single source, the incumbent Contractor.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this notice is to publicize this contract action prior to contract modification, as mandated in FAR Subpart 5.2 (Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions) and FAR Subpart 6.3 (Other Than Full and Open Competition). The contract type will remain Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) and the period of performance will not be extended.</p>
<p><br />This notice is not a formal solicitation or request for proposal.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

In the event the Contractor fails to provide adequate security, as required in this contract, no financing payment shall be made under this contract.

If at any time the Contracting Officer determines that the security provided by the Contractor is insufficient, the Contractor shall promptly provide such additional security as the Contracting Officer determines necessary. In the event the Contractor fails to provide such additional security, the Contracting Officer may collect or liquidate such security that has been provided and suspend further payments to the Contractor; and the Contractor shall repay to the Government the amount of unliquidated financing payments as the Contracting Officer at his sole discretion deems repayable.<br />(d) Reservation of rights.<br />(1) No payment or other action by the Government under this clause shall --<br />(i) Excuse the Contractor from performance of obligations under this contract; or<br />(ii) Constitute a waiver of any of the rights or remedies of the parties under the contract.<br />(2) The Government's rights and remedies under this clause --<br />(i) Shall not be exclusive, but rather shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or this contract; and<br />(ii) Shall not be affected by delayed, partial, or omitted exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege, nor shall such exercise or any single exercise preclude or impair any further exercise under this clause or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege of the Government.<br />(e) Content of Contractor's request for financing payment.

Each separately priced unit of each contract line item is authorized a fixed number of monthly installment payments. The number of installment payments authorized for each unit of a contract line item is equal to the number of months from the date of contract award to the date one month before the first delivery of the first separately priced unit of the contract line item. For example, if the first scheduled delivery of any separately priced unit of a contract line item is 9 months after award of the contract, all separately priced units of that contract line item are authorized 8 installment payments.<br />(2) Amount of each installment payment. The amount of each installment payment for each separately priced unit of each contract line item is equal to 70 percent of the unit price divided by the number of installment payments authorized for that unit.<br />(3) Date of each installment payment.

The last installment payment would be 1 month before scheduled delivery of a unit.<br />(4) Limitation on payment. Prior to the delivery payment for a separately priced unit of a contract line item, the sum of all installment payments for that unit shall not exceed 70 percent of the price of that unit.<br />(c) Contractor request for installment payment.

Unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer, all installment payments in any month for which payment is being requested shall be included in a single request, appropriately itemized and totaled.<br />(d) Dates for payment. An installment payment under this clause is a contract financing payment under the Prompt Payment clause of this contract, and except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, approved requests shall be paid within 30 days of submittal of a proper request for payment.<br />(e) Liquidation of installment payments. Installment payments shall be liquidated by deducting from the delivery payment of each item the total unliquidated amount of installment payments made for that separately priced unit of that contract line item. The liquidation amounts for each unit of each line item shall be clearly delineated in each request for delivery payment submitted by the Contractor.<br />(f) Security for installment payment financing. In the event the Contractor fails to provide adequate security as required in this contract, no financing payment shall be made under this contract. Upon receipt of adequate security, financing payments shall be made, including all previous payments to which the Contractor is entitled, in accordance with the terms of the contract. If at any time the Contracting Officer determines that the security provided by the Contractor is insufficient, the Contractor shall promptly provide such additional security as the Contracting Officer determines necessary. In the event the Contractor fails to provide such additional security, the Contracting Officer may collect or liquidate such security that has been provided, and suspend further payments to the Contractor; the Contractor shall repay to the Government the amount of unliquidated financing payments as the Contracting Officer at his sole discretion deems repayable.<br />(g) Special terms regarding termination for cause. If this contract is terminated for cause, the Contractor shall, on demand, repay to the Government the amount of unliquidated installment payments. The Government shall be liable for no payment except as provided by the Termination for Cause paragraph of the clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items.<br />(h) Reservation of rights.<br />(1) No payment, vesting of title under this clause, or other action taken by the Government under this clause shall --<br />(i) Excuse the Contractor from performance of obligations under this contract; or<br />(ii) Constitute a waiver of any of the rights or remedies of the parties under the contract.<br />(2) The Government's rights and remedies under this clause --<br />(i) Shall not be exclusive, but rather shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or this contract; and<br />(ii) Shall not be affected by delayed, partial, or omitted exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege, nor shall such exercise or any single exercise preclude or impair any further exercise under this clause or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege of the Government.<br />(i) Content of Contractor's request for installment payment.

This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided.

The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance.

    (4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.
    (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
    (6) Other paragraphs of this clause.

  (t) System for Award Management (SAM).
    (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
  (u) Unauthorized Obligations.
    (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
      (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
      (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
      (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
    (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.

The term "organizational conflict of interest" means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or the person has an unfair competitive advantage.
  (b) The offeror shall provide a statement with its offer which describes, in a concise manner, all relevant facts concerning any past, present, or currently planned interest (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) or actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the services to be provided under this solicitation. The offeror shall also provide statements with its offer containing the same information for any consultants and subcontractors identified in its proposal and which will provide services under the solicitation. The offeror may also provide relevant facts that show how its organizational and/or management system or other actions would avoid or mitigate any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest.
  (c) Based on this information and any other information solicited or obtained by the contracting officer, the contracting officer may determine that an organizational conflict of interest exists which would warrant disqualifying the contractor for award of the contract unless the organizational conflict of interest can be mitigated to the contracting officer's satisfaction by negotiating terms and conditions of the contract to that effect. If the conflict of interest cannot be mitigated and if the contracting officer finds that it is in the best interest of the United States to award the contract, the contracting officer shall request a waiver in accordance with FAR 9.503 and 48 CFR 809.503.
  (d) Nondisclosure or misrepresentation of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest at the time of the offer, or arising as a result of a modification to the contract, may result in the termination of the contract at no expense to the Government.

The line items that will be repaired under this contract have been uploaded with this synopsis as Attachment A. Nordam Group Inc. is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and the only known source to possess full repair capability. Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government.   For questions concerning this notice, contact Juliana Stack, 215-697-2560,  email: Juliana.stack@navy.mil.

The subject items requires Government source approval prior to contract award,  as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not  been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
  Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items has been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companyâ€™s experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at:

https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navsupwss/business_opps or by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697-4243.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS - P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

(d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order. (e) The Government?s rights to terminate this contract at any time are not affected by action taken under this clause. (f) If, as the result of the Contractor?s intentional or negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, or miscertification, a protest related to this contract is sustained, and the Government pays costs, as provided in FAR 33.102(b)(2) or 33.104(h)(1), the Government may require the Contractor to reimburse the Government the amount of such costs.

<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: SIGINT Collection, Processing and Exploitation</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA #11-04-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The objective of an effort under this Master BAA is the development of real-time processing technology to improve the extraction, identification, analysis and reporting of tactical information. The processed information will support the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission, protect blue coalition forces with command, control, computer and intelligence applications, and support battlespace awareness for the warfighter.</p>
<p>In the area of ISR information extraction for Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) issues, new and innovative methods and processing techniques will provide decision-makers with ISR information in as near real-time as possible. SIGINT technologies process information on various communications mediums, operate in environments in low signal-to-noise ratio areas and conduct operations against uncooperative targets where the noise types and channel conditions are frequently varying from message to message. As time is critical and ISR mission analysts' workload is high, the automation of the SIGINT collection, processing and exploitation capabilities in both tasking and training is a major goal.</p>
<p>The SIGINT research and development is grouped into three broad technology areas: Information Extraction, Signal Processing and Automation Enhancements. The first, Information Extraction, extracts information from the broadband signal to identify and catalog Signals of Interest (SOI). The second area, Signal Processing, processes the signal to improve signal processor performance for the above information extraction capabilities. This represents research in removing noise and interference in a channel or in multiple channels from signals. The third broad area, Automation Enhancements, uses signal processing techniques to automate the manual techniques that are current practice. This automation may be used to manipulate the SOI for storage and transmission or to synthesize the signal for a variety of purposes.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49.9M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 11 - $2M; FY 12 - $6.5M, FY 13 - $9.4M, FY14 - $8.5M; FY15 - $11M and FY16 - $ 12.5M. Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts normally ranging from $250,000 to $1,000,000. There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value.</p>
<p>Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received, subject to the availability of funds. All potential Offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.</p>

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - A scientific and technical quality assessment of the offeror's approach is to evaluate the development and/or enhancement of real-time SIGINT collection, processing and exploitation technology. White papers/proposals should document the potential quantifiable benefits in terms of increased efficiency of automated data processing, increased capabilities of interactive data processing tools, and increased capabilities to exploit machine-to-machine information. <br />2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge. <br />3) Application and Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and how well it applies to signals intelligence. <br />4) Reasonableness and Realism of Proposed Costs and fees to the extent applicable.</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel, and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: For classification guidance see section IV paragraph 5. "Classification Guidance for White Paper/Proposal Submissions".</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TS/SCI information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your Proposal.</p>
<p>3. Data Rights: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions apply:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk (Nov 2013)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding covered Defense Information Controls</p>
<p>6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">GRANT AWARDS ONLY:</span> For efforts proposed as grant awards, offerors must provide an abstract in their proposal (not to exceed one page) that is publicly releasable and that describes - in terms the public may understand - the project or program supported by the grant. The DoD will publically post the abstract to comply with Section 8123 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235).</p>

<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) TITLE: Mission Awareness for Mission Assurance (MAMA)</p>
<p>BAA ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>BAA NUMBER: BAA RIK-2014-0014</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RI), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to enable effective cyber situational awareness (SA) during mission execution to achieve mission assurance for military operations.</p>
<p>AFRL/RI conducts research in the areas of information management and dissemination as well as cyber science and technology. This research has led to the development of service oriented information management and dissemination implementations, in particular, Phoenix Prime. The continued development and maturation of innovative concepts and enhanced services that maximize the situational awareness during mission execution to achieve mission assurance of military operations is the primary focus of this BAA.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The Information Management Technologies Branch of the Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, are researching and developing techniques and services for information management in diverse military environments. Information Management (IM) is defined as a set of intentional activities to maximize the value of information to support the objectives of the military enterprise. These activities include role/policy based information access control, information tagging and contextualization through semantic assessment, discovery and identification, scalability and responsiveness to resource availability and the administrative activities that support them. Understanding how concepts for sharing information amongst disparate producers, consumers and operational domains and the technologies that can be applied in the unique military operational and tactical domains are of critical importance.</p>
<p>AFRL's information centric technology vision has culminated in a suite of AFRL Information Management (IM) services known as Phoenix Prime. Phoenix Prime is a service oriented information system that enables the management of all information interactions through domain independent "universal services" whose functions include obtaining, discovering, characterizing, identifying, prioritizing, mediating, persisting and disseminating information within and between mission partners. The most recent Phoenix Prime developments correlate users with operational activities, determine information requirements, assess information for mission relevance and establish information processing priorities based upon mission importance and system resource availability. <br /><br />A new consolidated program called "Mission Awareness for Mission Assurance" (MAMA) is being started under this BAA. The goal of MAMA is to enhance cyber situational awareness by the automated assessment of mission execution through the analysis of network traffic flows. This resultant capability is an enabler to achieving mission assurance by allowing prioritization of mission essential functions, mapping of critical cyber assets, vulnerability assessment of mission essential functions and mitigation of vulnerabilities and risks.</p>
<p>A key component of the Cyber Vision 2025 tenet of "Assure and Empower the mission" is that ensuring survivability and freedom of action in contested and denied environments requires enhanced cyber situational awareness (SA) for air, space, and cyber commanders. This can be enabled by, in part, mission mapping. The vision goes on to identify then enabling science and technology (S&amp;T) for mission assurance and empowerment as mission mapping to systems components, cyber mission verification across sensors/platforms and dynamic cyber mission configuration. This program acknowledges that cyber is inextricably entwined with the air and space missions, yet the Air Force has no "true" cyber SA, even for limited critical missions; therefore, the vision of this program is to expand upon the Cyber Vision 2025 S&amp;T platform to not only cyber missions, but to all Air Force missions. Much like the recommendations made by Cyber Vision 2025, the Scientific Advisory Board Study on Cyber Situational Awareness also advocates S&amp;T investment in automated mission mapping, data tagging, utilization of context-aware routers and the evaluation of these technologies in an operationally relevant environment. The study sees this investment crucial to addressing the fact that, even for critical missions, there is almost no understanding of Air Force mission dependencies on information systems.&nbsp; The global AF enterprise relies heavily on communication networks to achieve its mission of global vigilance, global reach and global power. However, as the AF and the nation are gaining unprecedented capabilities from high capacity global networks, it is also contending with increasingly sophisticated threats to its networks and systems. These threats range from distributed denial of service, to Anti-satellite (ASAT), to insider threats. While there are significant investments seeking to mitigate these threats, none will eliminate them. AFRL/RI recognizes that the first step to mission assurance, despite the presence of these threats, is improved SA for decision makers at all levels. This program seeks to provide mission awareness through extraction and analysis of content transiting the Air Force Network (AFNET), to inform Command and Control (C2) elements monitoring mission execution, and to control critical network elements to improve mission effectiveness.</p>
<p>MAMA's challenge is to first identify what specific missions are supported by what specific information flows. This is called "mapping information to missions." However, simply counting packets between endpoints may provide a measure of network performance, but it does not indicate much about mission performance. The Air Force must separate the SA needed to support cyber-dependent mission assurance from awareness of network health and status. Reports to commanders must be at the mission-impact level, not at the network level. The key is to operate higher in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) stack by tagging information objects with mission relevant data. MAMA will extract semantic content from mission relevant metadata of transiting information objects to assess mission status. In addition to supporting a MAMA's goal of addressing current missions, it is anticipated that the massive amount of extracted semantic content will be useful for other goals such as identification of "low and slow" cyber threats, a big data problem that falls outside the scope of MAMA, but within the scope of AFRL/RI. <br /><br />AFRL/RI is uniquely suited to develop the MAMA concept because it draws heavily upon a maturing, moderate Technology Readiness Level (TRL), set of prior investments to accomplish its objectives. Among these is the Content and Context-aware Trust Router (CCTR) as the high capacity broker that is capable of extracting and brokering information around the AFNET. The broker will forward selected traffic to Phoenix Prime, a cloud-scale enterprise-class information management system that will extract semantic content into a triple store accessible to backend analytics engines. The triple stores will challenge AFRL/RI's high performance computing expertise to maintain performance over time in an effort to continuously assess mission status. Perhaps most importantly, it will marry up AFRL/RISA's adaptive mission templates with a specific mission domain to semantically model the mission space, extract mission orders, and support mission awareness.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) and AF are operating within a contested cyber environment and its ability to accomplish their mission will require responding to network dynamics. In addition, peer competitors may deny us continuous communications with mission assets, leading to uncertainty for commanders. MAMA, while not directly assuring the mission, supports mission assurance by providing a network elements basis for resource allocation, and monitors information flows to infer mission performance on a large scale.</p>
<p>AFRL/RIS proposes to focus this program on the Space domain for several reasons. First, as a less mature domain, it is more receptive to technology insertion than the Air domain that has more mature processes and is in the midst of major acquisition efforts.</p>
<p>The high level challenge of providing mission awareness for mission assurance can be broken down into several sub-challenges that are addressed within the program structure. This BAA comprises three projects with each having its own technical risks that require substantial S&amp;T: 1) Mapping the Mission to Information Flows 2) Mission Information Sufficiency, Correlation, and Event Learning (MISCEL) and 3) Integration, Demonstration and Validation of MAMA.</p>
<p>At a high level, MAMA brings together three types of data: 1) models of information flows that support known mission types, 2) knowledge of specific missions being executed with principals mapped to corresponding roles, and 3) the information transiting the network either in support of these missions or from other unmapped data flows. Based upon these components, MAMA will provide mission awareness to C2 operators and provide feedback to Quality of Service mechanisms in the CCTR.</p>
<p>The current research and development focus areas to be conducted under this BAA are as follows: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - FY 15-16 - Mapping the Mission to Information Flows <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - FY 16-17 - Mission Information Sufficiency, Correlation, and Event Learning (MISCEL)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - FY 17-18 - Concept Integration, Demo and Validation of MAMA</p>
<p><strong>FY15-16 - Focus Area - Mapping the Mission to Information Flows</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Reference: IV.1: FY15 should be submitted by 1 Nov 2014 and FY16 by 1 June 2015 for this Focus Area.</p>
<p>The goal of the "Mapping the Mission to Information Flows" project is to build upon the Active Mission Templates (AMT) project currently under development under the Mission Responsive Information Services (MRIS) consolidated program. The AMT models will need to be extended to incorporate temporal models of information flows. The AMT project enables mission planners to specify semantic models (mission templates) of the information needs of users based on their roles, mission parameters, context, and situations. These models can then be instantiated and used by running IM services to help govern information dissemination that is responsive to specific mission needs. The set of AMT mission models will need to be extended to cover the domain of interest (currently a to-be-determined critical Joint Space Operations Center mission). The models will need to incorporate monitoring criteria to ensure that status reports reflect what commanders need to know. Furthermore, identified mission applications will need to be proxied to transform their message traffic into managed information objects, and MAMA will need to determine what metadata is necessary to support the mission requirements. Key challenges are developing a domain ontology, domain mission context/event definitions, operational concept exploration, complex event processing services, and mission context phase monitors and triggers. This effort draws heavily upon earlier investment in CCTR and Phoenix Prime's semantic extraction and reasoner capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>FY16-17 - Focus Area - Mission Information Sufficiency, Correlation, and Event Learning (MISCEL)</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Government is looking for white papers now for this Focus Area.</span></strong> The white papers for this focus area should be submitted no later than <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">13 Nov 2015</span></strong> for a FY16 award and 1 Sep 2016 for a FY17 award.</p>
<p>The goal of MISCEL is to develop a working architecture for semantic analysis based on textual and structural data extraction from information into mission intelligence, mission status monitoring, mission assurance notifications, and cross-domain situational awareness. The MISCEL project will harness an analytics engine to continuously monitor mission execution and system status.</p>
<p>Mission intelligence will be gained through the autonomous assessment of mission execution. This assessment is performed by analyzing mission information models, raw information contents, and semantic extractions (Temporal, Geospatial, Information, Mission, etc.) in order to determine information to mission(s) correlation, phase changes for mission essential workflows (MEFs), information workflow traceability, status, and mission prioritization. This previously uncaptured mission intelligence will enable effective management of the mission's information space and inform mission assurance capabilities. MISCEL will result in furthering the critical capability of enhancing mission awareness that empowers mission assurance, utilizing information fingerprints to intelligently bridge static, prescribed mission models with operational reality.</p>
<p>MISCEL is the 2nd phase of MAMA, which seeks to transition advanced mission awareness capabilities to the logistical, humanitarian, and mission domains of US TRANSCOM, while simultaneously providing interoperability and cross-SA information to other mission-domains. Phase I targets the production of use case mission models, messaging, and prioritization components. Phase II seeks to provide the intelligent metadata analysis and mission-driven information assessment engine that will manage and configure the core awareness capabilities. Phase III integrates the mission awareness components (Phase I) with mission intelligence capabilities (Phase II) and demonstrates them via red teaming and an operational technology experiment.</p>
<p>The key challenges to be addressed in this project are:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Mission Metadata Value Analysis and Assessment - Use cases for Information, Mission, MEF, and other algorithms have pre-requisite inputs, and are optimized if outputs are normalized. The value of metadata is variable to its applied algorithm, but capturing value can optimize algorithm selection from a catalog and measurably increase the probability of mission success. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Mission Correlation &amp; MEF Workflow Phase Changes- Relevant mission(s) should be identified, as autonomously as possible, when solutions are provisioned only with a set of mission models and raw information. MEF phase changes should be detected and/or learned. Future support for Decision Support hooks should be considered, where supervised, semi-autonomous learning can provide justifications &amp; mission participant decision points can be informed according to the roles, process, algorithms, and metadata value analysis results.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Information, Mission, and MEF Critical Events &amp; Prioritization - Disparate events identified from the information should be evaluated for mission criticality. Normalized scales of prioritization and criticality, aligned with relevant AF guidance and standards, need to be determined in order to inform and adapt agile mission aware messaging systems. Mission Assurance Categorization standards and MEF guidelines should inform the prioritization scale and the assessment results of executed algorithms.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - High Performance Combinational Data Mining/Learning - Developing algorithms, with Analytics Engine support, that mine a combination of semantic relationships, structured/unstructured information, and mission templates/models can result in solutions that are slow, and unable to scale to the growing scale of data exchanged and persisted. Also, complexity can grow unwieldy in converging diverse forms of analytics (Graph, MapReduce, NLP, etc.) and queries (SPARQL, XPATH, Keyword, KeystoneML, etc.). It can also be difficult to prove that algorithm(s) qualitatively enhances some facet of mission awareness, increasing the research and implementation complexity.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Behavioral Monitoring - Mission models/templates provide only the most minimal information sufficiency, and tend to be non-runtime adaptable, while also requiring manual supervision. MISCEL pursues behavioral monitoring capabilities that capture information provenance (queries, subscriptions, results, types, formats, etc.) for mission and mission role participants. This captured provenance should be taken into account by algorithms seeking to determine information relevancy increasing/decreasing over time, respective to mission types and roles. Information relevancy correlated to an individual (Personalized, adaptive content, etc.) is beyond the initial scope of the project.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Limited Ontology Scope and Interconnection - Stitching together existing ontologies (Phase I), or developing new ones, if required for the chosen technical approach, may produce more expansive, reusable, and interoperable knowledge of mission awareness. The core idea is that the maximal amount of mission awareness should be generated to inform better mission assurance decisions. Some technical approaches may emphasize a mix of ontologies, process modeling logic, other Mission QoS analytics, and others seeking to balance a mixture of all three. Consideration of past mission participant behaviors, identified mission assurance events, information clusters, and mission participant roles may provide a foundational set of relationships that better induce and learn mission events and workflows over time. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Mission Assurance Categorization notifications - Communicating identified information vulnerabilities, threats, and MEF events provide greater value if based upon, or interoperable with, existing MAC schemas and messaging standards. Past efforts at AFRL (CMAC) have approached this objective from a networking perspective, and enabling interoperability between network health/status and information SA would cross-pollinate advanced features and enable more agile and reusable Mission Assurance capabilities.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Mission-information visualization - While desirable, but not required, demonstrating the effectiveness of information, mission, and MEF analytics that steer mission assurance capabilities in an intuitive manner is complex, but provides powerful visual evidence of the impact of the resulting mission assessment capabilities.</p>
<p>Two benchmarks will be used, each of which consider the capturing of: mission metadata pre-requisites; attribute requirements; mission model constraints; prioritization; and other resulting outputs. The first benchmark will examine the impact of performing valuation of information and the use of that valuation to prioritize what relationships are more critical than others to extract and identify. The second benchmark will be a qualitative benchmark that can measure the effectiveness of the available mission analytics. This benchmark will be used to allow the pursuit of analytics proven to provide greater mission awareness, or that are proven to be more impactful in assessing vulnerabilities. MISCEL mission algorithms should pursue a mixture of offline/online approach that considers best-fit (batch, streaming, runtime/post-processing), as Information Management (IM) is a set of capabilities that operate in widely diverse environments (Tactical/Enterprise) that may be degraded or contested.</p>
<p>MISCEL will harness an analytics engine to continuously monitor mission execution and status. Effective monitoring may require balancing high-performance continuous query execution and relevancy-based storage management. Algorithms developed should either be externally verified for quality and effectiveness, or managed by runtime analytics-based QoS that qualitatively validates execution results for mission effectiveness. Although MISCEL should be applicable to diverse datasets, it is specifically targeted towards mapping and correlating raw information within the context of temporal-semantic models of mission lifecycles for missions of interest. This will provide mission context within the information space, and should provide interfaces/mechanisms for mission-driven information prioritization. A Mission Monitoring and Notification Service will be created that provides standards-based Mission Assurance Categorization messages. These messages provide a potential feedback mechanism to future mission assurance learning components, as well as to mission visualization and reporting components.</p>
<p>During the MISCEL project, one or more tools that statically model missions and mission essential functions should be leveraged. An existing option is Adaptive Mission Templates (AMT), a prototype mission modeling tool developed under the AFRL Mission Responsive Information Services Program. Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) or other tools that integrate Mission Essential Functions (MEF), resiliency processes, mission event impacts, and notions of role/identity mission participation with an integrated operational plan are other examples. While prescriptive mission models/templates provide enough adaptive structure to flexibly define multiple missions, MISCEL seeks to complement these deductive, model-based capabilities with content-based analytics that derive greater mission awareness from introspected information. This ability will be a milestone towards qualitatively improving the likelihood of mission success by utilizing mission models, ingested information, and the available information &amp; mission-based analytics.</p>
<p>Offerors are encouraged to pursue primarily offsite contractor presence, due to limited lab space availability, unless required to effectively foster collaboration, integration, and demonstration requirements.</p>
<p>Annual experiments and/or demonstrations in operationally relevant scenarios and domains will act as capability checkpoints throughout this effort. AFRL/RISA has a number of limited availability cloud testbeds, both on-site and off-site, that can be considered for use. Operationally relevant scenarios from the transport and logistics domain due are desired in order to align planned infrastructure &amp; algorithmic capabilities, and transition opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>FY 17 -18 - Focus Area - Concept Integration, Demo and Validation of MAMA</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">White Papers will be accepted in FY17 for this Focus Area.</span></strong> Reference: IV.1: FY17 should be submitted by 1 Sep 16 and FY18 by 1 Sep 2017.</p>
<p>The final project of the program is concept integration, demonstration and validation (DemVal). Red teaming will be used to ensure that these mission critical services are well designed and robust to cyber threats. This component serves several goals. The first is to simply expand the practice of red teaming to improve the maturity of capabilities we transition. Minimally, the system should pass all tests currently required for an authority to operate on NIPRnet/SIPRnet. However, AFRL/RI will go beyond that to consider active intrusion by a red team. In the past, there have been several programs that investigated system hardening, such as Secure Tactical Enterprise Gateway that matured the "crumple zone" concept first developed under the DARPA OASIS (Operations Analysis and Simulation Sciences) program. These ideas will be explored where appropriate, however, they were tuned to much lower throughput scenarios (e.g., tactical network), and so may not be applicable to high data rate deployments. The program will conclude with a limited technology experiment within an operational context. This project represents 25% of the funding and 15% of the technical risk. It is anticipated that the integration task and Limited Technology Experiment (LTE) will be under the Connectivity and Dissemination Core Technical Competency in the Information Systems Division (AFRL/RIS). The red teaming will be led by the Cyber Science and Technology Core Technical Competency in the Information Exploitation and Operations Division (AFRL/RIG) and executed on-site because AFRL/RI wishes to grow competency in this area.</p>
<p>Offerors are encouraged to provide an on-site contractor presence working at AFRL/RISA Rome, NY to foster collaboration with other in-house teams, to minimize integration risks and to effectively leverage experimentation/demonstration resources.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. GOVERNMENT APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: An offeror must have a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">government approved</span></strong> accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IMPORTANT</span></strong>: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab<br />=core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology, and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>VI. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO</span></strong> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry," Mar 2015, and Proposal Preparation Instructions, Dec 2014 may be accessed at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d<br />&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a top secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to top secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.</p>
<p>This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your white paper/proposal.</p>
<p>3. DATA RIGHTS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. SBIR RIGHTS. The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. NON-SBIR RIGHTS. Non-SBIR data rights are strongly encouraged to be unlimited, but will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions apply:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk (Nov 2013)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding covered Defense Information Controls</p>
<p>6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">GRANT AWARDS ONLY</span>: For efforts proposed as grant awards, offerors must provide an abstract in their proposal (not to exceed one page) that is publicly releasable and that describes - in terms the public may understand - the project or program supported by the grant. The DoD will publically post the abstract to comply with Section 8123 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235).</p>

<p>Please see the following link for installation access:<br />http://www.huachuca.army.mil/pages/des/accesscontrol.html</p>
<p>Visitors, contractors and vendors 18 years and older, entering Fort Huachuca, who do not have a DoD identification card, will be subject to a background check before being allowed entry to the installation. Those who present a common access card (CAC card), Military ID, Military Dependent ID, Gold Star ID, or other valid DoD credential won't be affected. This is to ensure that Fort Huachuca is in compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, which requires that 100 percent of visitors be vetted prior to entering the installation. While this is a DoD-wide initiative, we are doing all we can to streamline the process for accessing Fort Huachuca yet ensure the safety and security of the installation.</p>
<p>Please note, attendees will also be required to go through an access control point in Greely Hall. The attendee's name, company name and CAGE Code will be verified against the attendance roster using the attendee's Government Identification (normally a U.S. based driver's license) at the Greely Hall access control point.</p>
<p>The Industry Day will begin at 09:00 (AZ/Local Time). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>**Arriving after 09:00 (AZ/Local Time) will put an attendee at risk of not being allowed access into Greely Hall.**</strong></em></span></p>

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS) will issue a prospectus for solicitation of offers for a 10 year concession contract to provide for Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail, Transportation, and Other Services at the Mammoth Cave Hotel within Mammoth Cave National Park. The Director, pursuant to 36 C.F.R. Part 51, has determined the existing Concessioner is NOT a preferred Offeror for the Contract to be awarded.<br /><br />As an attraction, Mammoth Cave predates all national parks in the United States: historic records report that people first started visiting the cave in 1816, and it became internationally known by the mid-1800s. Congress authorized Mammoth Cave National Park on May 25, 1926. The purpose of Mammoth Cave National Park is to preserve the cave system, including Mammoth Cave, the scenic river valleys of the Green and Nolin rivers, and a section of south central Kentucky for recreational use, particularly the hilly country north of Green River. The Park contains the longest recorded cave system in the world with more than 400 miles explored and mapped. The Park was designated a World Heritage Site on October 27, 1981, and became the core area of an International Biosphere Reserve on September 26, 1990. <br /><br />The Concession Business Opportunity is comprised of Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail, Transportation, and Other Services: <br />The Concessioner will operate the Mammoth Cave Hotel which includes the Sunset Terrace Lodge, the Historic Cottages, and the Woodland Cottages, a full service dining room and a new fast casual facility, a gift shop located in the Mammoth Cave Hotel offering merchandise and Kentucky-made crafts. Additionally, the Concessioner will operate the Camper Store at the Service Center Complex, which provides grocery, camping supplies, and convenience items. The Concessioner also currently operates eight buses to transport approximately 42 percent of cave tour visitors from the visitor center to various cave entrances. Other required services include vending, kennels, and public shower/laundry services within its facilities. Gross revenues from 2010-2012 have been between $3,814,646 and $3,990,194.
<p>A site visit will be held on February 4, 2015 at Mammoth Cave National Park.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MODIFICATION # 12</span></strong> to Solicitation MACA002-16, a Concession Business Opportunity for Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail, Transportation, and Other Services at Mammoth Cave National Park</p>
<p>The National Park Service (NPS) will issue a prospectus for solicitation of offers for a 15 year concession contract to provide for Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail, Transportation, and Other Services at the Mammoth Cave Hotel within Mammoth Cave National Park. <br /><br />Additional Bus Transportation Rate Approval and Utilization Information for Question No. 5 from the 2nd Site Visit</p>
<p>Question: We (NPS) estimate that transportation revenue will be 15% to 20% of total revenue. How will the [transportation] rate be set and will the NPS write that into the contract? Without this knowledge, we really can't understand the profitability of this business opportunity.</p>
<p>Answer: The bus transportation rate that the National Park Service pays the concessioner is a per-passenger rate. The current approved rate method is comparability to ensure that the concessioner's rate is commensurate with the rates charged by other comparable transportation services. The bus passenger rate has to be reasonable, justified, and comparable with similar services provided by the private sector. The Service will determine reasonableness of the bus passenger rate based on current concessions management guidelines. The current rate of $3.00 per person will be established in the operating plan. The concessioner will be compensated at that rate until a rate increase is approved based on comparability. <br /><br />The last time that bus transportation rate at Mammoth Cave National Park was changed was in the spring of 2013 following a rate increase request from the concessioner. After a comparability review was performed, the bus transportation rate was increased from $2.65 per passenger to $3.00 per passenger.<br /><br />Since 2008, the number of bus passengers has ranged from 154,000 to 183,000. Bus transportation utilization has increased as park visitation has increased. In 2014, for example, there were 183,120 visitors transported by concessioner buses, which is 44% of the total number of 413,654 cave visitors. In 2015, there have been 167,912 visitors transported by concessioner buses (through September 30, 2015), which is 46% of the total number of 366,200 cave visitors.</p>

<p>
<p>The Draft Contract has been modified to change the term of the contract to Fifteen (15) years. Section 1 of the Draft Contract is changed as follows:</p>
<p>This Concession Contract No. CC-MACA002-16 ("Contract") shall be effective as of May 1, 2016, and shall be for the term of fifteen years (15) years until its expiration on April 30, 2031 if the Concessioner satisfactorily completes the Concession Facilities Improvement Program described in Section 9(d) and the PPIP project described in section 8(e)(3)of this Contract. If the Concessioner fails to complete these programs to the satisfaction of the Director within the time specified, then this Contract shall be for the term of five years until its expiration on December 31, 2020. The Director may extend this shortened term (but not beyond the original date of expiration of this Contract) in circumstances where the Director determines that the delay resulted from events beyond the control of the Concessioner.</p>
<p><br />The Draft Contract Required Services has been changed to add the requirement to operate retail sales in the visitor center. The chart in Sec. 3 (a)(1) has been changed to add:</p>
<p>iii Retail/Merchandise 300 sf in Visitor Center</p>
<p>The Updated Business Opportunity has been improved by the addition of several opportunities. Page 2 of the Updated Business Opportunity presents a chart of the major changes to the opportunity. Because the Prospectus has been delayed, the Service expects to award the Contract by May 1 of 2016. The NPS improvement project will be substantially complete at that time and the next concessioner will not be required to provide temporary food and check-in services prior to completion.</p>
</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SUMMARY OF MODIFICATION #8</span></strong><br /><br />The National Park Service issued this prospectus on December 18, 2014. This update contains several changes to the Draft Contract the Service believes improves the Business Opportunity. The following information highlights the changes from the prior prospectus.</p>
<p>
<p>Exhibit 1 - Summary of Changes from Original Solicitation<br />Topic Original Solicitation This Prospectus<br />Term of contract 10 years 15 years<br />Retail space in VC 0 square feet 300 square feet<br />Retail Close lower store Concessioner may use lower retail store space and have retail presence in dining area<br />Option to construct, expand, or renovate lodging Not Allowed Allowed*<br />Temporary Food and Beverage Service Required Not required. The Draft Contract will be awarded after the closure is ended.<br />Franchise Fee Not payable for year one to compensate for temporary Food and Beverage service Due for year one because the temporary Food and Beverage service will not occur.</p>
<p>Source: National Park Service<br />* Although not a Required or Authorized service, the Service is open to considering the construction of new lodging, restaurant, and/or retail facilities and/or expansion and/or renovation of the existing lodging, restaurant, and/or retail facilities if a donation were made for these purposes or the Concessioner were willing to fund these projects while waiving leasehold surrender interest. The donor and Concessioner would have to provide information requested by the Service, such as drawings, plans, etc., to make the determination that the project(s) will comply with Service standards and meet the purposes of the Park. The Service would make the decision whether to proceed with these projects.</p>
</p>
<p>In the Investment Analysis under the Concessioner Facility Improvement Program (CFIP) the Consolidate Retail Store Operations section, page 10, has been removed and replaced with this language: <br /><br />The Concessioner has the option of determining the configuration and use of space for retail in the Main Lodge Building. Currently, the Main Lodge Building contains the two retail locations as well as space in the dining areas. The Concessioner may use the existing retail and dining spaces for a mix of both services. If the Concessioner uses the lower retail space for a visitor service, the Concessioner must ensure that this area is ADA compliant. The Concessioner must return the existing retail storage area to visitor use either as a meeting room or as another visitor function. The Service estimates the cost of reconfiguring the retail space to be $25,000. Project costs may vary based on the configuration of displays. Facility renovations, such as installing or moving walls, lighting or wiring, require Service approval. The Concessioner must complete these retail improvements within the first two years of the contract. <br /><br />The Concessioner is required to operate the 300 square feet of retail space in the Visitor Center described in Exhibit D of the Draft Contract - Assigned Land and Real Property. In this space, the Concessioner may use only movable display racks and islands to accommodate cleaning.</p>
<p>
<p>In the Business Opportunity, Estimate of Required Investment, Exhibit 8 (page 17), the investment amounts have been updated to match the Draft Contract.</p>
<p>In the Business Opportunity, Financial and Operating Data (page 20), the Term and Effective Date has been changed as follows:</p>
<p>The CC-MACA002-16 Draft Contract has a term of fifteen (15) years beginning on its effective date, which the Service estimates as May 1, 2016.</p>
<p>Any prospectus documents not specifically cited in this Modification 8 referring to the Draft Contract term are now modified to reflect a term of fifteen (15) years.</p>
<p>In the Operating Plan, Section 8) Specific Operating Standards and Requirements, D) Retail, (9) Facility and Merchandise Appearance, (e) Safe Displays, page B-30, has added the following sentence: <br />Display shelves and counters located in the Visitor Center must be on wheels in order to allow for cleaning.</p>
<p>In the Draft Contract Section 10(c)(6) is deleted and replaced with the following:</p>
<p>6) Any balance in the Repair and Maintenance Reserve not duly expended by the Concessioner as of the termination or expiration of this Contract shall be remitted by the Concessioner to the Director as an additional franchise fee within fifteen (15) days after such termination or expiration. Interest on delayed payment shall be due in accordance with section 11(c) of this Contract. If any Repair and Maintenance Reserve funds have been obligated by the Concessioner but not expended as of the termination or expiration of this Contract, the Director and the Concessioner may enter into an agreement under which the Concessioner will expend such funds for their obligated purposes in lieu of a remittance of the unexpended funds to the Director as an additional franchise fee</p>
<p>Exhibit H-1 Deferred Maintenance has been reformatted and provides more detailed information</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MODIFICATION #7</span></strong><br /><br />This modification is to provide further explanation for Modification #6, which extended the solicitation for MACA002-16 an additional 63 days to June 17, 2015. The National Park Service intends to change the term of the contract to 15 years and make other operational improvements to the business opportunity. Once the changes have been finalized, the solicitation may be extended again to provide additional time for offerors to revise their proposals.<br /><br />All offers must now be received by the NPS No Later Than 4:00 p.m. (EDT) on Wednesday June 17, 2015, in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract. The National Park Service will issue an additional modification to reflect significant changes to the original solicitation. An additional site visit will be scheduled prior to the end of the new solicitation period and announced in the additional modification.<br />Points of Contact: Bruce Powell, Deputy Superintendent, Mammoth Cave National Park, bruce_powell@nps.gov, (270) 758-2186 or Mark Morgan, Concessions Management Specialist, Southeast Regional Office, mark_morgan@nps.gov, (404) 507-5638</p>

</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MODIFICATION # 5 to Solicitation MACA002-16<br /></span></strong>a Concession Business Opportunity for Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail, Transportation, and Other Services at Mammoth Cave National Park <br />Modification 5 encompasses the site visit questions with NPS responses from the February 4, 2015 Mammoth Cave Concessions Contract MACA002-16 site visit.<br /><br /><strong>1) Question: Summary Business Opportunity (SBO) Page 5 - Employee Housing - Please further describe multi-unit housing facility in terms of number of units and capacity of each. </strong></span></p>
<p>
<p>Answer: The Dormitory building is 4,832 square feet in size, and a portion of the building houses the laundry. The dormitory section of the building consists of six (6) two-room, one-bath dorm units. The pillow count is estimated to be 12.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>2) Question: SBO Page 6 - Investment Analysis-Deferred Maintenance - What are the circumstances that have allowed the maintenance projects to fall so far behind?<br /><br /></strong>Answer: The projects have fallen behind because the future of the contract has been uncertain for the past six years.<br /><br /><strong>3) Question: SBO Page 6 - Personal Property - Is there any detail on the personal property that is required to be purchased for $364K (item description, number of units, age, condition, etc.)?</strong></p>
<p>
<p>Answer: No, this information is not available. This estimate was prepared by a third party Personal Property valuator. Offerors are expected to make their own estimates.</p>
<p><strong>4) Question: SBO Page 10 - Food &amp; Beverage - Are there any agreements with food or beverage suppliers that continue after January 1, 2016?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: No, there are no agreements that continue past January 1, 2016.</p>
<p><strong>5) Question: SBO Page 11 - Retail - Is there a requirement that retail operations close during the off peak season?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: No, retail operations may continue during the off-peak season.</p>
<p><strong>6) Question: SBO Page 15 - Mammoth Cave National Park Visitation - Is there any market research available that defines visitor demographics?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The Service does not provide market research. All Offerors are responsible for conducting their own due diligence and calculating their own estimates and projections for revenues, costs, and all other purposes related to the Draft Contract. Visitor demographics at Mammoth Cave National Park ("Park") were last assessed in a Visitor Study that was conducted in 2006. A copy of this document is available upon request to Bruce Powell via email at bruce_powell@nps.gov.</p>
<p><strong>7) Question: SBO Page 16 - Retail - When does the NPS contract with Eastern National expire?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Eastern National Parks operates under a cooperative agreement involving many national park areas, not a contract. This multi-park cooperative agreement provides that it will continue indefinitely with the consent of both parties.</p>
<p><strong>8) Question: Exhibit B Page B-24 - Is a liquor license required/available for dining room service?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: In 2008, the Kentucky Attorney General rendered an opinion which stated that because of exclusive federal legislative jurisdiction over lands comprising Mammoth Cave National Park, the consumption and sale of alcoholic beverages on Park lands is not regulated by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Accordingly, the new concessioner will not be required to obtain a liquor license from the State of Kentucky for Main Lodge dining room alcoholic beverage service. Instead of a state-issued liquor license, the Service authorizes the concessioner to serve alcohol in the Main Lodge Building. As is mentioned on page B-25 of the operating plan, the Concessioner must comply with Kentucky Revised Statutes which, for example, require server training in alcohol regulations (STAR) class.</p>
<p><strong>9) Question: Exhibit D Page D-8 - Are any of the properties on historical registries, which might require special construction procedures during renovation?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes, Refer to Page 6 of the Proposal Package. Also, refer to Exhibit D, pages 8-9, for historical status. Finally, refer to Exhibit F, pages F-6 and F-7, Concessioner Project Procedures and Appendix G- Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>10) Question: What impact would an increase in White Nose disease have on the facility? Would the site be required to close for certain parts of the year or entirely if the threat of White Nose disease became epidemic?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The impact of White-nose syndrome (WNS) on the bat population in the park is dynamic as the disease runs its course. Park operations will likewise continue to evolve as management actions are implemented as a result of changing circumstances. Typically, bat die-off occurs during the second or third winter after WNS is discovered in a cave. Since being discovered in the Park in 2013, WNS has resulted in a die-off of as much as 80% of some bat species (per bat counts conducted in early 2015). Present Park management efforts relate to conducting risk assessments related to human-bat encounters, identifying additional prevention and response activities to minimize human-bat encounters, and developing communication and educational materials for employees and visitors. No cave tour closures have been implemented to date, and it is unlikely that cave tours in the Park would be curtailed in the future. Similarly, no cave tour schedule changes have occurred to date, and it is also unlikely that there would be significant cave tour schedule changes in the future. However, the Park reserves the right to take necessary or appropriate management actions in the event the dynamics of WNS, and their effect on Park operations and visitor safety, require such actions. Notwithstanding this, we believe it is unlikely that significant negative impacts to concession operations due to WNS will occur, yet some management actions, for short periods or time, can't be totally ruled out in light of visitor safety concerns.</p>
<p><strong>11) Question: What are the bus schedules for peak season and off season? Or, how frequently do they run during the peak and off peak seasons?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: During peak season, there are 16-18 cave tours offered each day that require bus transportation. During the off-peak season, there are 5-8 cave tours offered each day that require bus transportation.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>12) Question: Will the Concessioner pay or be assessed property tax on the real property?<br /><br /></strong>Answer: Assigned Government-owned real property and improvements will remain in Federal ownership during the term of the Contract. NPS does not assess property tax on assigned Government-owned real property and improvements. Offerors should note, however, that Kentucky Revised Statute 3.070(2) states that "Kentucky reserves . . . the right to tax persons, their franchises and properties, on the land [Mammoth Cave National Park] so acquired." Offerors are reminded that under the Contract, the concessioner will be responsible for compliance with all Applicable Laws. Accordingly, offerors should make their own determinations on whether KRS 3.070(2) will apply as to the concessioner under the Contract. The NPS estimate of the franchise fee is based upon the concessioner paying the appropriate amount of property tax based on historic tax payments.</p>
<p>
<p><strong>13) Question: What is the location of the facility where the lodging laundry is cleaned?</strong></p>
</p>
<p>Answer: The laundry room is located in a portion of the Dormitory building, southeast of the Sunset<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<span><strong>MODIFICATION #4 to Solicitation MACA002-16<br /></strong><br />A Concession Business Opportunity for Lodging, Food and Beverage, Retail, Transportation, and Other Services at Mammoth Cave National Park.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, on behalf of the Naval Sea Systems Command and the Navy Virtual SYSCOM (partners NAVSUP, NAVAIR, SPAWAR and NAVFAC) along with other Navy activities and Marine Corps, is conducting a rolling admission per the terms and conditions of the SeaPort Enhanced (Seaport-e) Multiple Award Contracts.
<p>The purpose of this rolling admission is to expand the contractor base by awarding additional Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) prime contracts. Existing Seaport-e prime contractors will also have the opportunity to expand their presence in other geographical zones to allow them to compete for Task Order awards in those zones and to voluntarily re-certify their size status. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541330 and the revenue size standard for Small Business is $38.5 Million.</p>
<p><br />SeaPort-e is the Navy's electronic platform for acquiring support services in 22 functional areas including Engineering, Financial Management, and Program Management. Authorized ordering activities compete their service requirements amongst SeaPort-e IDIQ multiple award contract holders. All task orders are competitively solicited, awarded and managed using the SeaPort-e electronic platform.</p>
<p>Oral proposals will not be conducted. Awards will be made on initial offers without discussions. Please email questions concerning Rolling Admissions to <a href="mailto:seaport_epco@navy.mil">seaport_epco@navy.mil</a>.</p>
<p>The Government desires an increase in Small Business, HubZone, Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB); Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB); Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB); and 8(a) concerns. Businesses in these categories are encouraged to submit offers as primes.</p>
<p>Information concerning this rolling admission is available on the Seaport homepage at www.seaport.navy.mil. Copies of the previous Rolling Admission solicitation N00178-14-R-4000, the original Rolling Admission Industry Brief (dated November 2004), and questions and answers to the previous solicitations can currently be found on the homepage.</p>
<p>The solicitation number for this Rolling Admissions is N00178-16-R-4000. It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued on 02 November 2015 with a response date of 13 January 2016. The target date for the Rolling Admission awards is June 2016. The Government reserves the right to change these dates. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor the Seaport site for the release of solicitations, amendments, and supporting information.</p>

<DESC>USGS Guam magnetic observatory asphalt road and parking project

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) operates and maintains the Guam magnetic observatory on U.S. Air Force property adjacent to Andersen Air Force Base near the town of Dededo, Guam.  The property is approximately 30 acres and consists of two occupied quarters/houses, a shop/garage/warehouse building, an office building, and two magnetic observation buildings.  The main asphalt roadway through the site is showing significant wear and tear and needs to be repaired.  Additionally, portions of the road will be widened, several new parking areas will be installed, and the road will be lengthened to reach the shop/garage/warehouse building.
  
Full project details will be provided in the forthcoming Statement of Work (SOW).  Payment protection (either a payment bond or irrevocable letter of credit) will be required; performance bonds will not be required.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between $25,000.00 and $100,000.00.  The Construction Wage Requirements Statute (prevailing wage, formerly Davis-Bacon Act) does not apply to this project.  Prospective contractors must hold a valid contractor's license in Guam at the time quotations are due to be considered for this project, and shall be required to submit evidence of same with their quotations.

The USGS contemplates award of a firm-fixed price contract.  The request for quotations (RFQ), including a detailed SOW and contractor evaluation criteria, will be available on or after 11/02/2015.  Site visit opportunities will be provided; prospective contractors are strongly encouraged to visit the site prior to submitting a quotation.  Interested parties may contact the Contracting Officer identified below by email to be added to the interest list or to inquire about a site visit.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS, 2012) code is 238990, all other specialty trade contractors, with corresponding index entry "asphalting, residential and commercial driveway and parking area."  The associated small business size standard is $15.0M in average (three year moving average) annual revenue.  This immediate acquisition is set-aside for participation by HUBZone small business concerns and there is no incumbent contractor.  

Please direct all inquiries to the Contracting Officer, Jeff Caravelli, at jcaravelli@usgs.gov.

<AWARDEE>CA, Inc., 2291 Wood Oak Drive

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 8.405-6(a)(1) and as instructed by FAR 8.405-6(a)(2), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is publishing this notification to industry of a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Delivery Order award supported by a limited sources justification. On September 29, 2015, CBP issued a Firm Fixed Price Delivery Order under the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Contract GS-35F-0823M to CA, Inc. CBP awarded Delivery Order Number HSBP1015F00440 on a sole source basis to CA, Inc. as the incumbent contractor to provide CA Licenses and Maintenance for a period of performance from September 30, 2015 through October 31, 2015, and 4 option periods through September 20, 2019.
<p>This is a limited sources acquisition under FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) which states, in pertinent part, that an ordering activity may be justified in limiting sources of supply when "only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized."</p>
<p>This is an enterprise-wide follow-on contract for brand-name, CA, mainframe software, distributed software, and network monitoring tool maintenance. This procurement will ensure continued maintenance of CBP OIT CA Mainframe and Network monitoring Software which includes periodic code and version updates, documentation re-issues, on call configuration maintenance, product life cycle management and any user specialized training. A sole source award to the incumbent is the most efficient and economically viable option to ensure this procurement will provide continued support.</p>
<p>The use of another database product will force CBP to redesign and functionally duplicate thousands of database structures, convert billions of rows of data and completely re-write millions of lines of application code and security profiles. Efforts are underway to migrate applications off the mainframe, which will significantly reduce the use of CA software products, but it is a multi-year effort. If the planned migration is completed ahead of schedule, CBP will shorten the length of the contract correspondingly.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization).
IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3). Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
695-16-1-133-0007	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER : N/A	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT:
$27,500.00 base year
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
Justification and approval for a firm-fixed price base and 4 option year contract with The Spectranetics Corp. Shall furnish all labor, travel, consumable and non-consumable parts (including the laser vessel) for service and maintenance of the Spectranetics CVX-300 Laser Lead Extractor located at the Milwaukee VAMC.
3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:  No other vendors were located through market research and posting to a government wide site (FBO) that were available to do services on the Spectranetics Laser CVX-300.
4. REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES: Given market research to include historical documents, no other vendors were found that could do the work.
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED: Posted a sources sought notice to FBO on 5/19/15 with no responses from the vendor community. Searched GSA, FSS, Vetbiz, small business vendors, internet and historical documents and could not locate other vendors to do the work.
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC><p>It takes 4 to 6 weeks for new temporary staff to complete the PIV process, a requirement for all new staff before they are allowed to access HUD systems, our choice of action is limited. Upon examination, the only way to avoid a break in service while the protest is resolved is to replace the expiring orders with new orders issued against a new short-term BPA with National Associates so that the same temporary help personnel, all of whom have completed PIV cards and have active credentials, can continue to provide these important services without break in service until the protest is resolved. It should be noted herein that the PIV cards and credentials held by the current temporary staff will expire should a break in service occur.<br />Consequently, BPA Number DU203NP-16-A-01 will be issued to National Associates for six month ordering period of 10/9/2015 through 3/10/2016 with an estimated ceiling of $500,000</p>
