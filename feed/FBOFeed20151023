<SUBJECT>Request for Information - Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope High Precision Polarizers
<SOLNBR>WFC-010
<RESPDATE>110615
<CONTACT>Harvey S. Bass, Contracts Officer, Phone 520/318-8445    , Fax 520/318-8500, Email hbass@aura-astronomy.org
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">Announcement of Opportunity No. WFC-010<br />Request for Information on <br />High Precision Polarizers</p>
<p>The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA), on behalf of the National Solar Observatory, is soliciting Information from qualified contractors regarding large diameter high precision polarizers for use at the Gregorian focus of the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), a 4m off-axis telescope currently under construction on Maui, HI. The telescope concentrates solar light and feeds an f/13 focus with up to a 5 arcminute field of view beam after a heat stop aperture. The desired polarizer would be used near this Gregorian focus in a beam with a ~3 Watts per square centimeter flux (solar spectrum) for some minutes or longer for calibration of a suite of visible and IR instrumentation. AURA is interested in a &gt;110mm circular clear aperture polarizer with high contrast, high transmission, low WFE components to work with visible and near-infrared instrumentation in the 380nm to 5000nm wavelength range. AURA understands that the wide wavelength range, high contrast goals and large part diameters present unique design and fabrication challenges. Some performance goals may or may not be met with any single optical component or substrate and that several substrates (fused silica, infrasil, sapphire, silicon, etc.), manufacturing processes and techniques may be required and requests information on a polarizer that may meet several (or all) of the possible criteria described in the attached Technical Data Sheet.</p>
<p>AURA requests information on wire grid polarizers, polarizer substrates and / or alternative solutions to creating an optic. Firms interested in submitting Information Packages should send a letter of interest on firm letterhead referencing the Announcement of Opportunity No. WFC-010 and include physical mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address (if available) for a contact person and address the questions below. (Response Format: 50 page max, single sided, double spaced, 12 point type min) Submissions shall be sent via email to the Contracts Officer, at: hbass@aura-astronomy.org, not later than Friday, November, 6, 2015.</p>
<p>Responses Requested:</p>
<p>1) What specifications (suggested or generated by your own team) do you think you can achieve for what cost? If a range of options are possible, please outline costs and performance for the various solutions.<br />2) What is your plan to verify performance once you build the part?<br />3) What is your corporate heritage in delivering large custom optics similar to our requested polarizers? Have you successfully done similar projects?<br />4) What are the cost drivers for your proposed solution?<br />5) What are the risk factors (for various options) in your proposed solution?<br />6) What is the largest clear aperture available and expected uniformity?<br />7) What kind of operating environment can be tolerated?<br />8) What polarization contrast ratio can you guarantee?<br />9) Is an AR coating on the substrate possible to reduce absorption, fringing and scattered light?<br />10) Are there any expected changes due to exposure to high flux beam over the lifetime of the polarizer?<br />11) Please provide scratch/dig, beam deviation, uniformity, WFE, transmission, etc. <br />If you have any questions, please contact the Contracts Officer at (520) 318-8445 or via the above email. All inquiries and their responses will be posted on the DKIST public webpage.</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR BIDS. AURA IS SEEKING INFORMATION ONLY AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR PROPOSALS MAY BE ISSUED AT A LATER DATE.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Technical Data Sheet</p>
<p>Note: These are AURA's desired specifications but is open to alternatives.</p>
<p>1) Opto-mechanical Requirements:<br />Optic outer diameter maximum120mm with a similar clear aperture (goal &gt;110mm). (Identify significant performance enhancements or cost breaks if smaller clear apertures are suggested. <br />Stable operation in a beam of ~3 Watts per square centimeter incident flux (solar spectrum) for as long as possible (goal &gt;10 minutes).</p>
<p>2) Operating environment: <br />Sea level to 10,000 feet MSL, operation at Haleakala summit. <br />Operation in 3% to 95% relative humidity, non-condensing.</p>
<p>3) Possible specifications of interest:<br />Polarizing contrast ratio: <br />Contrast ratio (when crossed) as high as possible <br />Extinction ratio averaged over clear aperture over wavelengths of interest and field of view (goal &gt;300).</p>
<p>4) Angle of Incidence &amp; Field of View:<br />Beam from telescope is converging ~f/13 with a FOV up to 5 arcminutes. <br />Field of view is at least 3 arcminutes with performance goal of 5 arc minutes.</p>
<p>5) Wavelength Range:<br />Wide coverage across Visible, Near-UV and IR to 5 microns desired.<br />Nominal wavelength range 380nm to 5000nm as a goal using one or more substrates / optics.</p>
<p>6) Absorptivity &amp; Temperature Stability:<br />Maintain stable performance under 3 W/cm^2 (solar spectrum) for as long as possible <br />High flux beam likely implies low absorptivity and highly reflective polarizing technique (non-absorbing).</p>
<p>7) Transmission:<br />High transmission over the wavelength range(100% linearly polarized input aligned with transmission axis of polarizer) Goal of &gt;=75%</p>
<p>8) TWE Flatness:<br />Goal of &lt;=3 waves P-V at 633nm, only tip/tilt removed. (Possible to separate power (spherical Zernike WFE term) from other higher order terms if this drives cost or manufacturability).</p>
<p>9) Reflected beam WFE:<br />WF Flatness and error terms not critical, but reflected beam should not be focused or strongly diverged to allow for mitigating the heat in the reflected beam.</p>
<p>10) Uniformity across the aperture:<br />Uniform performance in an f/13 converging beam is desired.<br />Typical beam footprint is &lt;30mm for zero field. <br />We understand there may be performance trades at smaller clear-aperture diameters. Outline a solution at smaller apertures if a significant performance gain or cost reduction is identified.</p>
<p>11) Optical quality:<br />Scratch/dig on the optical surfaces or a similar surface quality metric (low scattered light desired, and impact on polarization contrast ratio. Goal: 60/40 or better)<br />Wedge specification (what wedge with what accuracy? Parallelism in substrate(s) has Impact on fringing and beam deviation when optics is rotated)<br />Beam deviation when the optic is rotated (when well centered in a rotating mount. The wedge and substrate thickness has impact)</p>
<p>12) Fringing (Coherent interference from multiple internal reflection): <br />Spectral fringes (multiple internal reflections) should be minimized (single substrate, AR coated?)<br />Impact on wedge, anti-reflection coatings, substrate thickness, protective cover materials or coatings?<br />Typical "window-like" substrates with mild wedge and good optical quality likely would be sufficient</p>
<p>13) Mechanical considerations:<br />Non-brittle? Hardness? Scratch protection?<br />Survives fast rotation in a stage (acceleration power spectrum?)<br />Survives basic seismic activity (another basic acceleration power spectrum?</p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract modification, N00178-05-D-4546-4Y03, on a non-competitive basis with Sabre Systems, Inc. 65 W. Street Rd., Suite A-200 Warminster PA 18974-3229 for the procurement of programmatic support services in order to continue support for the 1.0 Competency and PMA 251 program. NAWCAD provides full life-cycle support for (ALRE) and (EAF). This includes catapults, arresting gear, shipboard aviation information systems, visual landing aids (VLA), lighting systems, surfacing systems and geotechnical systems, and other related systems on aircraft carrier (CVN), amphibious assault ships (AAS), and air capable ships (ACS).</p>
<p>NAWCAD has identified the effort to bridge current programmatic support until a competitive contract is awarded in order to avoid a break in service from the current contract. A gap in support would reduce resources (personnel) in multiple areas and negative impacts in these areas threaten delays in production programs, government furnished information, required in yard dates, ship change documents, and government furnished equipment.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR COMPETITVE PROPOSALS. This acquisition is being pursued under the sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Unless stated herein, no additional information is available. Requests for the same will be disregarded. A determination by the Government not to compete this effort is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or be responsible for any money expended by interested parties before award of a contract for the effort described above. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.</p>

The Contractor shall provide all services at their own facility.  Procurement Method:  Contracting by Negotiation.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 811121 and the annual size standard is $7.5 million.
  The contract term will be a base period of one year plus four option years.  The total term of the contract, including all options, will not exceed 60 months.  The Government will not synopsize the options when exercised.  IDIQ work may be issued via the DOD EMALL, a web-based ordering system, using Government purchase cards.  Only the base period of the contract will offer a minimum guarantee.  This is a new procurement.  It does not replace an existing contract.  No prior contract information exists.  Offerors can view and/or download the solicitation, and any attachments, at https://www.neco.navy.mil/ when it becomes available.  All interested offerors shall register at the website.  No notice of solicitation activity will be provided to interested offerors.
  A sources sought notice was issued on March 13, 2015.  Only one firm provided requested information.  Since there is no reasonable expectation that offers would be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns, the solicitation will be issued as unrestricted.  The NAVAC Hawaii small business office concurs with the set-aside determination.  Large business concerns are required to submit a subcontracting plan prior to award of the contract.  The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit a technical proposal, past performance and experience information, and a price proposal for evaluation by the Government.  Proposal receipt date is approximate.

approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or

source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification
procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having
jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item
requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is

Additional information about potential OCI issues is provided in a link that can be found at FedBizOpps website located at <a href="http://www.fbo.gov/">http://</a><a href="http://www.fbo.gov/">www.fbo.gov</a></p>

<DESC>Electronic Warfare Technology Challenges<br />Request for Information (RFI)<br />October 2015<br /><br />Contact: The Electronic Warfare Community of Interest (EW COI), under the sponsorship of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)). <br /><br />Email: usarmy.apg.rdecom-cerdec.mbx.i2wd-ewcoi-rfi@mail.mil.<br /><br />Synopsis: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. The purpose of this notice is for the government to obtain market research information and gain an understanding of the marketplace. EW COI is seeking information from academia and industry regarding both internally-funded Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) efforts and externally funded (contract or grant) efforts that map to six EW Technology Challenge areas. Knowledge of these efforts is of significant interest for identifying investments being pursued inside and outside the Services, and will help provide information on advanced technology options for incorporation into the overall EW COI Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Roadmap.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.202 (e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This is a pre-solicitation RFI and the EW COI is currently conducting market research only. No award is intended as a result of this synopsis. The Government will not reimburse costs incurred by Respondent in response to this RFI, or for participating in information exchange regarding details of the RFI. <br /><br />Due Date: 3PM EST on 03 November 2015. Pending a review of the responses, the quality of submission and the level of specification of the information provided, Government intends to down-select responses and may conduct follow up discussions (if needed) with Respondents. Please note however, the Government is under no obligation to conduct these follow-up Q&amp;A sessions. <br />Description: The 17 S&amp;T COIs were established in 2009 by OASD(R&amp;E) as a mechanism to encourage multi-agency coordination and collaboration in cross-cutting technology focus areas with broad multiple-Component investment. The COIs provide a forum for coordinating S&amp;T strategies across the Department, sharing new ideas, technical directions and technology opportunities, joint planning programs, measuring technical progress, and reporting on the general state of health for specific technology areas.<br /><br />The principal products of the COIs are strategic plans and roadmaps with a 20 year horizon that capture technical goals and mission impact. Their analyses identify common S&amp;T needs and the means by which they are being addressed, highlight development and investment gaps, and facilitate planning for future investigation and collaboration opportunities. These plans are used to guide long-term budget decisions and to influence near-term program priorities in each of the Components. <br /><br />The Electronic Warfare COI was formed to address the concern that rapidly evolving challenges to spectrum dominance threaten blue force lethality and survivability. By acting as the EW S&amp;T collaboration body for the DoD, the EW COI will define a cross-cutting EW S&amp;T investment strategy and recommendations. This involves the use of electromagnetic (EM) and directed energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) or to attack the enemy while protecting our own EM systems against both intentional and unintentional interference. Technology efforts pertinent to these goals are organized under a taxonomy of six Technology Challenge (TC) areas. They are:<br />EW COI Technology Challenge (TC) Areas<br /><br />1. Cognitive/Adaptive Capabilities: Develop the ability to effectively outpace adversary decision and technical options.
<p>2. Distributed/Coordinated/Net-Enabled Systems: Achieve spatially and temporally diverse responsiveness to dense and complex threat environments.</p>
<p>3. Preemptive/Proactive Effects: Prevent or disrupt the adversary's ability to engage our forces.</p>
<p>4. Broadband/Multispectral Components and Systems: Enable the widest possible spectral extent to our control of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>5. Modular/Open/Reconfigurable Architectures: Achieve timely deployment or insertion of advanced EW capabilities in response to rapidly changing conditions.</p>
<p>6. Advanced Electronic Protection Techniques and Technology: Allow unfettered operations in the increasingly dense electromagnetic spectrum environment.<br /><br />Requested Information: The EW COI requests specific information regarding research and development efforts that pertain to the EW COI Technology Challenge areas, and will only review the following information:<br /><br />&bull; Section 1. Description of company or academic institution and expertise as pertains to EW.<br /><br />&bull; Section 2. List of IR&amp;D and externally funded efforts mapped to the EW technology challenges described above. For externally funded efforts identify the funding organization.<br /><br />&bull; Section 3. Description of each IR&amp;D and externally funded effort with explanation for why the program maps to its associated Technology Challenge area(s). List the planned funding ($K) for each identified effort in 2016 (specify either by government fiscal year or calendar year). Specification of current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) including justification and evidence for maturity assessment. <br /><br />&bull; Section 4. Projected technology roadmap in accordance with a current and/or sample funding plan to achieve a fielded capability for each effort<br /><br />o Be sure to specify which parts of the plan are currently funded vs. which parts are not funded<br /><br />o Future cost estimates, ROMs and information regarding funding amounts are NOT required for this RFI<br /><br />All compliant submissions must contain section headings and provide the information requested under the section in order to be evaluated. <br />Solutions already fielded by any Service should not be submitted. Additionally, technologies lower than TRL2 should not be submitted for this RFI.<br />Submission Requirements: All assumptions, including any assumed government support, shall be clearly identified. Multiple submissions for different component technologies will be accepted. All documents shall be marked accordingly. Submission of proprietary and other sensitive information shall be marked and identified with disposition instructions (submitted material will not be returned). All respondents to this RFI MUST BE US CITIZENS.<br />All emailed questions and RFI responses shall contain the subject line: <br />R&amp;D ADDRESSING EW COI RFI. <br /><br />Responses are required in soft copy Adobe .pdf format. Documents shall not exceed 10 (ten) pages in length - excluding title page and table of contents.<br />An original hardcopy and one electronic copy of each proposal shall be submitted.<br /><br />&bull; An individual proposal submission from an offeror shall be classified either UNCLASSIFIED or SECRET.Proposals shall be marked and appropriately wrapped, delivered in hard copy (one each) and magnetic media (one each) [Adobe&reg; Portable Document Format suggested].

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. The U.S. Government currently intends to award a contract for Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) and training materials on a SOLE SOURCE basis, but is seeking vendors that may be able to perform this requirement in order to support a competitive procurement. Living Works Education ASIST Training is highly specialized and therefore has been chosen as training program for crisis centers nationwide by the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a nation-wide crisis intervention program with a network of over 150 crisis centers and used as a first line contact by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, NIH, and many state and local mental health organizations. Based on extensive research, the Government is not aware of anyone else offering the same level of services. Accordingly, the U.S. Government highly encourages all interested businesses (large and small) to respond to this sources sought synopsis. In addition, small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), must describe their identifying capabilities in meeting the requirements at a fair market price, i.e., information which may help support a set-aside.
<p>The proposed sole source 36-month Requirements Type Contract (RTC) is to Livingworks Education L.P. for ASIST and training materials for CONUS and OCONUS locations in support of the Office of the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff G-1 and the Army's ongoing efforts to prevent the incidence of suicides and suicide attempts among Army personnel. The statutory authority for the sole source procurement is 10 United States Code 2304(c)(1) as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Attached are the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS), Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) and Technical Exhibits with workload data.</p>

Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, if a competitive solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The NAICS code is: 611710 - Educational Support Services, size standard is $15,000,000.</p>
<p><br />In response to this sources sought, please provide:</p>

<p>3. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.</p>
<p>4.

The Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center (RLR VAMC), Indianapolis, Indiana, is conducting a market survey for qualified firms capable of providing primary medical care services through a community-based outpatient clinic (CBOC) in the Bloomington, Indiana geographical location.

The RLR VAMC "parent facility" requires CBOC services providing primary care, mental health, and other specialty services to approximately 5,000 Veterans living or residing in the Bloomington, IN area.

Contractor personnel will provide compassionate care with respect for the special needs of the veteran population served. The CBOC will be contractor-owned, contractor-operated and must follow the VHA PACT Model. Contractor performing Primary Care Services will provide a continuum of care from prevention to diagnosis and treatment, to appropriate referral and follow-up. Contractor's CBOC must have the necessary professional medical staff, diagnostic testing and treatment capability, and referral arrangements needed to ensure continuity of health care. Contractor will be responsible for recruiting and retaining quality providers, as well as providing office space for other specialty services and clinics. Contractor will provide primary care, laboratory and X-Ray, Pharmacy and other specialty services, making it more convenient for Veterans to obtain care within the local area.
The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (large business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, HubZone, 8(a), small disadvantaged business, or small business) relative to NAICS Code 621498 (business size standard of $20.5 Million per annum). 
Responses to this synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. Responses should include: company name, service capability statement, examples of similar facilities to which same or similar services were provided; DUNS number, including address, point of contact, and the size of the business pursuant  to the following questions: (1) Is the business large or small? (2) IF small, does the firm qualify as a small, emerging business or small disadvantaged business? (3) IF disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group, and IF the firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is the firm a certified HubZone firm? (5) Is the firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is the firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small or Veteran-Owned Small Business?

<DESC>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)<br />Acquisition Management Division<br />Sources Sought for Non Commercial Item Purchase
<p>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on vendors that are capable of providing for Process Design Data Membership Dues for 2015. This is included as part of membership to The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AICHE). NIST participates in a variety of organizations, committees, and consortia to assess the availability of information comparable to that provided by the proposed vendor. In addition, on a triennial basis, NIST issues an open invitation to the community at large to discuss and demonstrate potential information sources. Finally, NIST staff routinely monitors the relevant literature which would reveal alternative vendors.<br />This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify organizations with the requisite qualifications to meet the requirements of the item stated herein. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and compared with NIST's minimum (see Technical Specifications above), NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then this acquisition may be solicited as a small business set aside. NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large and small businesses (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, SDVOSB and VOSB). This requirement is assigned a NAICS code of 334513. The specific purpose of this Sources Sought Announcement is to determine if there are small businesses, within the parameters identified above, that are capable of providing the product identified.</p>
<p>Interested business organizations that believe they are capable of meeting the requirement should submit electronic copies or mailed copies of their capability statement. Please limit responses to ten (5) pages or less. Responses should include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Name of company that will provide product.<br />2. Name of company that will manufacture the product.<br />3. Spec sheets and examples of products that meet the specifications.<br />4. Typical lead time to deliver the product after receipt of order. <br />5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>Any proprietary information should be so marked. The written capability statement should be received by the Contracting Officer no later than 2 p.m. MST Monday, October 26, 2015. The capability statement shall identify the business status of the organization.</p>
<p>Only electronic or mailed statements will be accepted. Faxes will not be accepted. Send to Angela Hitt, Contract Specialist, at angela.hitt@nist.gov. Direct all questions to this e-mail.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice
<p>HHS-NIH-NCI-SS-ETSB-1028-27</p>
<p>This is a Small Businesses Sources Sought notice (SS).  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small business;  HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this project is 621999. The small business size standard is $15M.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Contact Center, also known as NCI's Cancer Information Service (CIS), was established in 1975 and is a federally funded program that is an essential part of NCI's cancer education and information efforts. The first call the Contact Center took was in early 1976.   This project is for the re-competition of contract HHSN261201000004C with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Prior to the current contract, NCI's CIS Contact Center operated concurrently through 4   competitively awarded five-year contracts. This Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of NCI.</p>

The optimal process/business perspective should also include how you could meet the coding accuracy rate of 97% with a decrement for inaccuracy with the auditing conducted by the applicable MEDCOM HRP and how records could be coded accurately within 72 hours.</p>
<p>b. The MEDCOM seeks input regarding method, frequency, and information technology considerations to remotely code approximately 4 million outpatient encounters annually at 23 different MEDCOM locations via the DoD-specific Application Virtualization Hosting Environment (AVHE), accessed through a Citrix client. What computer hardware and software do you envision could adequately support a large data set, remote coding operations, common access card (CAC) smart card reader, and DoD certificates?</p>
<p>c. What risks do you identify in your business approach and how would they need to be mitigated in order to successfully perform the enterprise-wide outpatient remote coding services?</p>
<p>d. What prior experience can you offer for similar services for a medical organization?</p>
<p>e. Business type (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a)-certified small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, very small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based upon North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541219 Other Accounting Services.</p>

<DESC>BACKGROUND: The Intelligence &amp; Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT) is a Non-system Training Aids, Device, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) Program of Record that enables proficiency training for Military Intelligence (MI) Occupational Specialties, including but not limited to collectors and analysts, to exploit intelligence data in training events just as they would in "real world" operations in support of the U.S. Army MI training strategy. IEWTPT fills a MI specific war fighting function training gap at Home-station, Combat Training Centers, and Reserve and National Guard locations supporting sustainment of critical individual, collective, and crew tasks/skills. It is the key simulation enabler for MI personnel training currently supporting All Source, Human Intelligence, Signal Intelligence, Geographical Intelligence, and potentially Measurement and Signatures Intelligence, Open Source Intelligence, and Cyber Intelligence. IEWTPT trains/supports collection, processing, exploitation, dissemination and cross-queuing of multi-discipline intelligence data supporting mission command and mission execution training events. IEWTPT provides warfighting commanders at all echelons the ability to train the Intelligence Warfighting Function based on accurately portraying the operational environment by simulating the necessary attributes of that environment and stimulating MI warfighting equipment where system operators and analysts are able to conduct their tasks and synchronize their Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance assets (in a training environment) to exploit training events' intelligence data and provide the commander with required, timely, accurate and executable intelligence information and products.
<p>U.S. Army Contracting Command - Orlando and the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation's (PEO STRI) Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets, and Threat Simulators' Special Operations Forces Training Systems (STS) is seeking pre-solicitation feedback from eligible contractors of the IEWTPT effort.

All contractors requesting access to the IEWTPT SSS must be cleared DOD contractors that must be vetted by the PEO STRI G2 and the Defense Security Services (DSS).</p>
<p>If Foreign Ownership, Controlled or Influenced companies request access to the IEWTPT SSS, they must provide a copy of the appropriate DSP-5 license agreement from the U.S. State Department before dissemination can be made.</p>

<CONTACT>Belinda F Triplett, Contracting Officer, Phone 256-544-3203, Fax 256-544-2934, Email belinda.f.triplett@nasa.gov

<a href="mailto:belinda.f.triplett@nasa.gov">Belinda F Triplett</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>A cubesat-scale solar sail propulsion system is being developed at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to provide propulsion for a 6U interplanetary cubesat to be used for the Near Earth Asteroid Scout (NEAS) project.	NEA Scout will fly on the Space Launch System (SLS) Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1) mission scheduled for launch in 2018 and is being developed in collaboration with NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  The solar sail will be allocated the mid-2U stowage volume within the 6U spacecraft bus.	NEAS will perform a slow flyby of a NEA within approximately two years of launch.  The deployed sail area will be approximately 86 square meters and has a tentative mass allocation of 2.5 kg.  Once ejected from the SLS, the NEAS will perform systems checkout and then subsequently deploy the solar sail (nominally within 3-4 days after launch).  The solar sail will provide the primary source of flight system V.  If the spacecraft is still functioning after the asteroid flyby, then an extended mission to visit a different NEA will be considered.  <p> NASA MSFC desires for the solar sail technology and design being developed for the NEAS mission to be commercially available after the completion and delivery of the flight system hardware in 2018.  To further that goal, NASA MSFC may discuss providing the solar sail propulsion system design to interested commercial entities.  Please contact NASA MSFC, following the instructions below, if your organization is interested in being a commercial provider for future solar sail propulsion systems. <p> SOLAR SAIL OVERVIEW <p> The solar sail is based on the technology developed and flown by the NASA NanoSail-D. Four 7.4 m stainless steel Trac booms wrapped on two spools (two overlapping booms per spool) will be deployed by a motor from within the allocated cubesat volume. The booms will pull the sail from its stowed volume as they deploy. The sail material will be 3 micron CP1, an aluminized polyimide that was extensively tested for solar sail applications and used in NASAs 400 square meter solar sail ground demonstrator project. The solar sail will be stowed spooled, rather than z-folded. Processes related to the fabrication of the booms and substrate material will not be provided as these are commercially available piece-parts used as part of the integrated solar sail system. 	 The baseline reflective sail area required to meet the missions delta-V requirements is 78 square meters. Since part of the sails surface will have its reflectivity reduced due to structural reinforcement needs, and taking into account that a few small tears in the sail are almost inevitable, the actual deployed sail area will be approximately 86 square meters, providing some propulsive margin. <p> A NEAS illustration is attached to this announcement. <p> SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: <p> Responses to this NOTICE should be no more than seven pages in length, not including any letters of commitment from sponsoring or partner organizations. Pages in excess of the page limitations for each section will not be evaluated. A page is defined as one (1) sheet 8 1/2 x 11 inches using a minimum of 12-point font size with normal kerning for text and 8-point for graphs. Responses should not include proprietary information.  <p> The response shall consist of: <p> Page 1: Cover page including: Name of organization; Mailing address and phone number of organization; Web site of organization (if applicable); Name, mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number of primary officer of the organization; Name, mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number of organizations point-of-contact for the response (if different from primary officer). <p> Page 2: Briefly describe your organization, including history, primary activities, interests, capabilities, and financial and personnel resources. Include any experience of the organization that is similar or analogous to solar sail technology and that demonstrates competence, integrity, commitment to safety and ability to work cooperatively in partnering arrangements. List any current or previous (for the past five years) contracts, grants or agreements with your organization and any federal agencies that exhibits these abilities or that relates to solar sail technology.  Please provide customer points of contact and how to reach them (phone and email). <p> Page 3: Describe your organizations interest in solar sail technology and your reasons for wanting to be a provider of it. Describe any goals that you would have for the technology - above and beyond those of direct potential NASA interest. <p> Pages 4, 5 & 6: Describe your organizations desired approach to commercializing the technology, and maintaining its capability to reproduce, fabricate and deliver space-qualified solar sail propulsion systems to future government and commercial customers.  A discussion of what your company might contribute in-kind before the NASA MSFC Solar Sail propulsion system is complete that would facilitate its development and future commercial availability is also requested. <p> Page 7: Describe your companys/organizations ITAR compliance status.	Is company registered with the US Department of States Directorate of Defense Trade Controls?  (<A HREF="http://pmddtc.state.gov/registration/index.html">http://pmddtc.state.gov/registrati on/index.html </A> )  Are any non-US persons employed by the organization?  The U.S. Government requires all manufacturers, exporters, and brokers of defense articles, defense services or related technical data to be ITAR compliant. <p> All responses to this NOTICE, including signed letters of commitment, must be submitted in a single PDF file as an attachment to an electronic mail message to Belinda Triplett at <a href="mailto:belinda.f.triplett@nasa.gov">belinda.f.triplett@nasa.gov </a> . Paper submissions will not be reviewed.  Please include Notice Reference Number in the subject line of the e-mail.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotations. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract, nor do they affect a potential Offeror's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation which may or may not follow or restrict the U.S. Government's eventual acquisition approach. Additionally, the U.S. Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Interested vendors responding to this RFI must provide capability information for an entire solution. Respondents will not be notified of any results derived from a review of the information provided; however, information gathered may be utilized for technical and acquisition purposes.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), Fort Rucker, AL intends to negotiate solely (as prescribed in FAR 13.106(b)(1)(i)) with Humanetics Innovative Solutions, Inc. 47460 Galleon Drive, Plymouth MI 48170, for the procurement of Load Sensing Headform Test Device.
<p>The FOCUS headform is a unique physical test device designed for evaluating the protection provided by newly-developed face and eye protection devices. The FOCUS headform has the same facial anthropometry as the mid-size USAARL headform, which represents a 50th percentile male aviator. This facial anthropometry ensures that the headform has the appropriate anatomical features needed to properly fit aviation and ground Soldier helmets. The facial region of the headform is divided into several discrete sections including the frontal bone (left and right sides), the zygoma (left and right sides), the maxilla (left and right sides), the nasal bone, mandible, and eyes (left and right sides). Each discrete facial region can be equipped with custom three-channel load cells to measure impact loads. The load cells were custom designed so that all 10 load cells could be simultaneously installed within the small facial region of the headform. The FOCUS headform is manufactured to have a inertial properties identical to the standard Hybrid II headform. For compatibility with standard crash test dummies, the FOCUS headform was designed to mate with a standard Hybrid III neck. The force-deflection response of the FOCUS headform's synthetic eyes and orbits match those of the in situ human eye when impact in the anterior-posterior direction. A Facial and Ocular CountermeasUres Safety (FOCUS) headform with full facial instrumentation is to be purchased. The sole source for this equipment is Humanetics Innovative Solutions, Inc.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 334516 and the size standard of 500.</p>
<p>Fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice, the purchase will be awarded without further remarks. All questions and responses concerning this notice shall be emailed to Abraham Pottenger at abraham.g.pottenger.civ@mail.mil</p>
<p>Interested concerns must identify their capability in writing to the above e-mail address or by mail to the address listed above no later than fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice at 3:00pm ET.</p>

<p align="left">may not be answered due to time constraints of the solicitation.</p>
<p align="left">1. The overall evaluation methodology will be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT). The</p>
<p align="left">Government will select the best value in which competing offers' past performance history</p>
<p align="left">will be evaluated. The evaluation criteria are divided into three factors: Technical</p>
<p align="left">Capability, Past Performance and Cost/Price. Technical Capability will be assessed utilizing,</p>
<p align="left">Table 1. Technical Ratings and Table 2.</p>
<p align="left">2. <strong>Acceptable </strong>- Clearly meets all specified technical capability requirements necessary for</p>
<p align="left">acceptable contract performance. <strong>Unacceptable </strong>-Fails to clearly meet one or more specified</p>
<p align="left">technical capability requirements. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are considered not</p>
<p align="left">awardable.</p>
<p align="left">The tradeoff will occur only between the past performance factor and the price factor. Past</p>
<p align="left">Performance will be evaluated as significantly more important than Price.</p>
<p align="left">3. The Offeror's proposal shall include all data and information requested and must be</p>
<p align="left">submitted in accordance with these instructions. <strong>Failure to submit proposals as outlined</strong></p>
<p align="left">below may render a vendor ineligible for award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">4. The proposal shall not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather</p>
<p align="left">shall provide convincing rationale to address how the offeror intends to meet these</p>
<p align="left">requirements. Offerors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their</p>
<p align="left">experience and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the offeror's proposal.</p>
<p align="left">The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable; possesses</p>
<p align="left">sufficient technical expertise and experience; possesses sufficient resources; and is able to</p>
<p align="left">plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that</p>
<p align="left">technical requirements will be achieved.</p>
<p align="left">5. Offeror's proposal shall consist of a cover letter and three (3) separate volumes:</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Cover Letter shall include the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Small Business Status/Categories as appropriate</p>
<p align="left">Company point of contact with email, phone and facsimile number</p>
<p align="left">Cage Code &amp; DUNS number</p>
<p align="left">A statement that your company understands the requirements specified in the</p>
<p align="left">Performance Work Statement (PWS) and will meet the performance standards and</p>
<p align="left">requirements therein.</p>
<p align="left">A statement that your company does or does not take exception to any of the</p>
<p align="left">requirements of the PWS or terms/conditions of the resulting contract.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Volume I</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Technical Capability Factor Ratings: The technical rating evaluates the quality of the</p>
<p align="left">offeror's technical solution for meeting the Government's requirement. Technical evaluations</p>
<p align="left">shall utilize</p>
<p align="left">the ratings listed in Table 1.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Table 1. Technical Ratings</p>
<p align="left">Determinati</p>
<p align="left">on</p>
<p align="left">Definition</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Acceptable ALL of the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal. The</p>
<p align="left">offeror's proposal meets the performance and technical capability requirements</p>
<p align="left">defined in the PWS.</p>
<p align="left">Unacceptable Not all of the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal. An</p>
<p align="left">unacceptable proposal contains one or more deficiencies. The proposal fails to</p>
<p align="left">meet specified minimum performance and technical capability requirements</p>
<p align="left">defined in the PWS.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Volume II</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The Past Performance evaluation will be accomplished by reviewing aspects of an</p>
<p align="left">Offeror's recent and relevant past performance, focusing on and targeting performance</p>
<p align="left">which is relevant to the effort, as it directly relates to the work being procured under this</p>
<p align="left">solicitation and recent within three (3) years from the issuance date of this solicitation.</p>
<p align="left">a. The Offeror shall include documentation regarding their relevant past</p>
<p align="left">performance as it clearly relates to the work being procured under this</p>
<p align="left">solicitation. The Offeror shall provide at least three (3) of the most relevant</p>
<p align="left">contracts performed for Federal agencies and/or commercial customers within</p>
<p align="left">the last three (5) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation. The</p>
<p align="left">submittal shall include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance and</p>
<p align="left">how it was determined that the work performed previously was the same or</p>
<p align="left">similar in nature, size, and complexity to the work specified by this</p>
<p align="left">solicitation. In the event an Offeror is not able to provide at least three (3)</p>
<p align="left">relevant past performances within the last three (3) years, then the Contracting</p>
<p align="left">Officer shall use an integrated assessment to evaluate past performance. If it</p>
<p align="left">is discovered by the Contracting Officer that an offeror failed to disclose a</p>
<p align="left">relevant contract, the contracting officer may find the offeror nonresponsive.</p>
<p align="left">In your selection of recent and relevant projects/programs, consider the</p>
<p align="left">following:</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Recency:</p>
<p align="left">relevant past performance within the last three (3) years from the date of</p>
<p align="left">issuance of this solicitation.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Relevancy</p>
<p align="left">extent of similarity between the service/support effort, complexity, dollar</p>
<p align="left">value, contract type, and the Offeror's role as a subcontractor and/or teaming</p>
<p align="left">partner or other comparable attributes of past performance examples and the</p>
<p align="left">source selection requirements; and a measure of the likelihood that the past</p>
<p align="left">performance is an indicator of future performance.</p>
<p align="left">b. In conducting the past performance evaluation, the Government reserves the</p>
<p align="left">right to use both the information provided in the Offeror's Past Performance</p>
<p align="left">Volume and information obtained from other sources, such as the Past</p>
<p align="left">Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), the Contract</p>
<p align="left">Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Defense Contract</p>
<p align="left">Management Agency (DCMA) or similar systems, and commercial sources.</p>
<p align="left">Offerors are reminded that both independent data and data provided by</p>
<p align="left">Offerors in their proposals may be used by the Government to evaluate</p>
<p align="left">Offeror past performance. However, the burden of providing thorough,</p>
<p align="left">complete, and current past performance information as requested in this</p>
<p align="left">paragraph remains with the Offerors. Proposals that do not contain the</p>
<p align="left">information requested, risk rejection.</p>
<p align="left">c. The past performance evaluation results in an assessment of the offeror's</p>
<p align="left">probability of meeting the solicitation requirements. The past performance</p>
<p align="left">evaluation considers each offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of</p>
<p align="left">performance in supplying products and services that meet the contract's</p>
<p align="left">requirements. One performance confidence assessment rating is assigned for</p>
<p align="left">each offeror after evaluating the offeror's recent past performance, focusing on</p>
<p align="left">performance that is relevant to the contract requirements. Past Performance</p>
<p align="left">will be evaluated using the following ratings:</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Table 1. Performance Confidence Assessments</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Rating Description</p>
<p align="left">Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance</p>
<p align="left">record, the Government has a high expectation that</p>
<p align="left">the offeror will successfully perform the required</p>
<p align="left">effort</p>
<p align="left">Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance</p>
<p align="left">record, the Government has a reasonable</p>
<p align="left">expectation that the offeror will successfully</p>
<p align="left">perform the required effort</p>
<p align="left">Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance</p>
<p align="left">record, the Government has a low expectation that the</p>
<p align="left">offeror will successfully perform the required effort</p>
<p align="left">No Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance</p>
<p align="left">record, the Government has no expectation that the</p>
<p align="left">offeror will be able to successfully perform the</p>
<p align="left">required effort</p>
<p align="left">Unknown Confidence (Neutral) No recent/relevant performance record is available or</p>
<p align="left">the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no</p>
<p align="left">meaningful confidence assessment rating can be</p>
<p align="left">reasonably assigned</p>
<p align="left">All recent and relevant past performance comments received will be taken into account</p>
<p align="left">and could affect the overall rating. The overall past performance evaluation is a</p>
<p align="left">subjective decision based on the whole of all data received. In the case of an Offeror</p>
<p align="left">without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past</p>
<p align="left">performance is not available, or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can</p>
<p align="left">be reasonably assigned; the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on</p>
<p align="left">past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a) (2) (iv)). Therefore, the Offeror shall be</p>
<p align="left">determined to have unknown past performance and be deemed "neutral."</p>
<p align="left">d. Submission Requirements. The offeror shall submit a Past Performance</p>
<p align="left">Volume containing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client Authorization Letters for each identified effort for a commercial</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">customer authorizing release to the Government of requested information on the</p>
<p align="left">Offeror's performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevant Contracts Reference Sheet - <strong>(see attachment 6). </strong>The Offeror</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">shall provide documentation outlining the Offeror's past performance with</p>
<p align="left">contracts, as prime, subcontractor, teaming partner, and /or joint venture partner,</p>
<p align="left">which is the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the services being</p>
<p align="left">procured under this solicitation. The submittal shall include rationale supporting</p>
<p align="left">the Offeror's assertion of relevance and how it was determined that the work</p>
<p align="left">performed previously was the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to</p>
<p align="left">the work specified by this solicitation. Offerors are required to explain what</p>
<p align="left">aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort, and to what</p>
<p align="left">aspects of the proposed effort they relate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Past Performance Questionnaire - <strong>(see attachment 3). </strong>For the contracts</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">identified on each Relevant Contracts Reference Sheet, the Offeror shall forward</p>
<p align="left">a copy of the past performance questionnaire to the points of contact responsible</p>
<p align="left">for monitoring performance under such contracts. The points of contact shall</p>
<p align="left">return the questionnaires via email <em>directly </em>to the Contract Specialist (Mr. John</p>
<p align="left">Porter) not later than the solicitation due date. Any questionnaires not returned</p>
<p align="left">directly to the Government point of contact (Mr. John Porter) will not be reviewed</p>
<p align="left">and evaluated. It is the Offerors responsibility to ensure questionnaires are</p>
<p align="left">provided to the Government point of contract (Mr. John Porter) on or before the</p>
<p align="left">due date. The information contained in the questionnaires will be used to evaluate</p>
<p align="left">the Offeror's past performance.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Volume III</p>
<p align="left">Cost/Price will be evaluated for reasonableness, balance and completeness. Since this is</p>

L. 113-235), Government <br />agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) <br />under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or <br />subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal <br />confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such <br />employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a <br />designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or <br />agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene <br />requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by <br />a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. <br />(c) Representation. By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not <br />require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or <br />abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise <br />restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, <br />or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal <br />department or agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-<br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have," the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);<br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (JUL 2013)<br />(a) Definitions.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes- <br />(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted</p>

L. 113-235), Government <br />agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) <br />under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or <br />subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal <br />confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such <br />employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a <br />designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or <br />agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene <br />requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by <br />a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. <br />(c) Representation.

<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-<br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have," the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);<br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.

<p>(a) The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information.<br />(b) The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest is<br />discovered after award, the Contractor will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting<br />Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions which the Contractor has taken or<br />proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize<br />the actual or potential conflict.<br />(c) The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an organizational conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential organizational conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(d) The Contractor further agrees to insert provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder.</p>
<p><br />FAR 52.204-13 System for Award Management Maintenance (JUL 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes- <br />(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.14; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at http://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

(1)  System Sensitivity/Penetration
This test should be done with the following settings:
"	maximum transmit power
"	proper receiver gain and TGC that allows echo texture to be visible in the deep region
"	transmit focus at the deepest depth
The maximum depth of visualization is determined by comparing the gradually weakening echo texture to electronic noises near the bottom of the image.

(2)  Image Uniformity

(4)  Gray Scale Photography (if applicable) - Do either (a), (b), or (c).

(a)  For Scanners with a Discrete Bar Pattern
Count the number of distinct gray bar steps on the viewing monitor.  Then count the number of steps visualized in the gray bar on the hard copy image.

(b)  For Scanners with a Continuous Gray Bar Pattern
Use calipers to measure the length of the black-to-white transition of the gray wedge on the viewing monitor.  If the relative length of the black-to-white transition on the hard copy image is less, document how much is missing.

(c)  For Laser Imager (Hard Copy Device)
Prior to filming any images, an SMPTE test pattern created by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), should be printed using the appropriate window width (WW) and window level (WL).  If you are unfamiliar with this procedure, you should review Gray et al., "Test pattern for video display and hard-copy camera," Radiology 145:519-527 (1985), and then contact your local service engineer for assistance.  When printed, the 95% density patch within the 100% square and the 5% density patch within the 0% square should be visible, and there should be no notable distortions or artifacts present.  If these criteria are not met, contact your service engineer for laser camera calibration before proceeding with any filming.

(5)  Hard Copy Output Quality Test (Digital) (if applicable)
This test, or a similar test specifically recommended by the hard copy equipment manufacturer.

Required Test Equipment

"	Densitometer
"	SMPTE Test Pattern or another similar test pattern or phantom image having a wide range of gray scales.

The same test image should be used each time.

J.  Display Monitors

	The annual performance evaluation conducted by the diagnostic medical physicist includes testing of image acquisition display monitors for maximum and minimum luminance, luminance uniformity, resolution, and spatial accuracy.  The image acquisition display monitors for nuclear medicine, PET, CT and MRI units shall be tested. Assess the viewing conditions for the area in which the monitor used to evaluation the CBCT studies is located.

K.  Display Monitors - Minimum Criteria

Perform a visual analysis of the SMPTE test pattern.  
1.	Display the test pattern on the imaging console.  Set the display window width/level to the manufacturer-specified values for the pattern.  Do not set the window/level by eye; doing so invalidates the procedure.

2.	Examine the pattern to confirm that the gray level display in the imaging console is subjectively correct.
a.	Review the line pair patterns in the center and at each of the corners.
b.	Review the black-white transition.
c.	Look for any evidence of "scalloping" (loss of bit depth) or geometric distortion.
3.	Use a photometer to measure the maximum and minimum monitor brightness (0% and 100% steps)
4.	Measure additional steps within the pattern to establish a response curve.
5.	Measure the brightness near the center of the monitor and near all 4 corners (or all 4 sides, depending on the test pattern used).

5.  Review of the technical QA program:
The qualified expert shall review the technical QA program.  The review shall include a trend analysis of the QA data.  The results of the technical QA program review shall be included in the written report.  Any trends that identify problems shall be included in the report along with recommended corrective actions.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

In addition, address key elements for each project by describing: 1) The role and responsibilities of the individual in the project; and 2) The specific A-E services performed by the individual in the project.
 Projects not meeting these requirements will not be considered.

SF 330, Part 1, Section F, Example Projects, CRITERION 2, SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE: The evaluation will consider specialized experience and technical competence of the proposed team relative to the primary and secondary A-E services indicated for this contract. The evaluation will place more emphasis on projects involving the Primary Services listed in the required A-E services. Projects completed by the prime A-E firm identified in Part I may be given more consideration in the evaluation process than projects of proposed subcontractors. Projects completed in the NAVFAC SW AOR may be considered more favorably in the evaluation process.

Submission Requirements:
For the proposed team, submit a minimum of five (5) and a maximum of ten (10) specific, recently completed projects that best illustrate overall team experience in the required A-E services listed above.
  At least three (3) of the projects shall have both a minimum A-E fee of $500,000 and be self-performed by the Prime A-E firm.

venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be
submitted for each joint venture partner, while ensuring you do not exceed the maximum of ten (10) projects for the proposed team. If a project was performed by a joint venture, and all joint venture partners are not on the team proposed for this contract, the firm should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner teaming on this contract.
 Likewise, if the team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

Address key elements by identifying and discussing: 1) Present workload and capability to integrate work under this contract with other work; 2) Methodology the prime A-E firm will use to execute a minimum of 50% of the contract value with in-house personnel; 3) Availability of the project team (including subcontractors) for the specified contract performance period; 4) Capacity to accomplish multiple large task orders simultaneously; 5) Strategy to meet surges in unexpected workload demand.

CRITERION 4, PAST PERFORMANCE: The evaluation will consider the Offerors past performance on relevant Government and/or commercial projects regarding quality of work, cost control, compliance with performance schedules, and customer satisfaction, with emphasis on example projects presented in Section F.
  The evaluation will be based on past performance assessments and other available past performance information.  Points of contact provided in the proposal may be contacted.  Where there is no record of past performance, the proposal will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably.  Superior performance ratings on relevant projects may be considered more favorably in the evaluation.

Submission Requirements:  Submit an A-E Contractor Appraisal Support System (ACASS), Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (CPARS), or a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) evaluation for each project submitted under Criterion 2.  If a completed ACASS/CPARS evaluation is available, it shall be submitted with the completed SF330 package.
 If there is not a completed ACASS/CPARS evaluation, the PPQ included with this notice is provided for the Offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project. If a PPQ is submitted, but an official ACASS/CPARS evaluation is found for that project in government databases, the official evaluation will take precedence. If an ACASS/CPARS evaluation is not available, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.  Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF330.  If the A-E is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project before the response date set forth in this notice, the A-E should complete and submit with their response the first page of the PPQ (Attachment #1), including contract and client information for the respective projects.

If the client requests, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Governments point of contact, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest, Code RAQ20.HH, Attn: Hal Hayes, via email at harold.hayes@navy.mil, prior to the response date.  A-Es shall not incorporate by reference into their response ACASS/CPARS or PPQ evaluations previously submitted in response to other A-E services procurements.  However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation.  Submitted ACASS/CPARS and PPQ evaluations will not be counted as part of the 30 page limitation and shall be attached to the SF330, behind the SF330 Part II document(s).

CRITERION 5, LOCATION AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCALITY: The evaluation will consider the teams location, demonstrated knowledge of, and project experience within, the geographic areas where projects are anticipated for this contract.
  The preponderance of the work will be at Government installations in southern California.  Prime A-E firms with a local office in southern California may be considered more favorably in the evaluation.

 Describe any projects that have been certified by the LEED program or other similar programs. 

CRITERION 7, QUALITY CONTROL: The evaluation will consider the Offerors Quality Control (QC) program for ensuring technical accuracy of the A-E work product and effective cross-coordination among various disciplines.  Firms that demonstrate a QC process that will minimize the governments quality assurance (QA) effort in reviewing the A-Es work product may be considered more favorably in the evaluation.

Submission Requirements:

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 1.35pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">RHAP&rsquo;s Development Objective (DO 2) is to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS on the southern Africa region.&nbsp; RHAP accomplishes this goal by providing management and programmatic oversight to the limited presence countries &ndash; Lesotho and Swaziland &ndash; and by strengthening the quality of PEPFAR programs implemented in 10 countries in the region. Countries included in the region are South Africa, Mozambique, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Angola, the Kingdom of Swaziland, and Lesotho.&nbsp; RHAP technical advisors provide in-presence and virtual support not only to USAID Missions and Offices, but to the entire PEPFAR inter-agency staff within a country.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 1.35pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The region that RHAP supports, Southern Africa, remains the epicenter of the global AIDS epidemic. &nbsp;According to UNAIDS, in 2014 Swaziland had the highest HIV prevalence in the world at 27.7%, followed by Botswana (25.2%) and Lesotho (23.4%).&nbsp; The 9 highest-prevalence countries in the world are in southern Africa.&nbsp; In the region, only Angola, at 2.4% prevalence, has an HIV prevalence of less than 10%.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the rate of new infections is declining in every country, and the number of people living with HIV who are on antiretroviral treatment (ART) has increased more than 30-fold since 2004, there are still enormous challenges to reaching the goal of an AIDS-free generation.&nbsp; In 2014, an estimated 13.6 million people in the region are infected, only 46% (6.4m) of whom are on ART.&nbsp; To achieve the 90-90-90 goal of 81% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) on ART by 2020, an additional 4.6m PLHIV must be put on ART in the next 5 years. The impact of HIV in the region is also compounded by a rampant tuberculosis epidemic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 style="margin-right: 1.35pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal;">With PEPFAR 3.0, countries have focused their programs on sustainable control of the epidemic.&nbsp; They have adopted a data driven approach to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 global goals and work towards an AIDS-free generation.&nbsp; Data is a key factor in implementing the PEPFAR pivots and in decision making.&nbsp; Recent PEFFAR requirements such as the new Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting indicators (MER), Site Improvement through Monitoring Systems (SIMS), Data for Accountability, Transparency and Impact Monitoring (DATIM), and quarterly reporting for the PEPFAR Oversight Accountability Response Team (POART), add to the full complement of SI-related expertise expected of the incumbent of the position.&nbsp;</span></h2>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>11. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (MAR 2000) The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.</p>
<p>9. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (MAR 2000) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.</p>
<p>10. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (MAR 2000) <br />a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-<br />(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension;<br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below);or <br />(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below).<br />(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.<br />b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.<br />c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.<br />d. If this contract is terminated for default, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any<br />(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br />e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.<br />f. If, after termination, it is determined that the Contractor was not in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.<br />g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (MAR 2000) Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract. Notwithstanding the requirements for any NAFI inspection and test contained in specifications applicable to this contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the NAFI, the Contractor, shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies provided under the contract conform to the drawings, specifications, and contract requirements listed herein, including if applicable the technical requirements for the manufacturers' part numbers specified herein. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. Acceptance of the supplies or services or a written notice of rejections must be accomplished on or before the fifth working day following delivery of the supplies or services, unless otherwise specified in this contract.</p>
<p>12. VARIATION IN QUANTITY (MAR 2000) No variation in quantity of any item called for by this contract will be accepted unless authorized by the Contracting Officer.</p>

PAYMENTS (MAR 2000) - Partial payments will be made when deliveries are authorized or as approved by the contracting officer. Payments and penalties for late payments are subject to the requirements established by the Prompt Payment Act, as amended, and as implemented for NAFI's. If the NAFI makes payment but such payment fails to include a prompt payment penalty due to the Contractor within 10 days from when the contract payment is made, penalty amounts will not be paid unless the Contractor makes a written request within forty days after the date of payment.</p>
<p>15. HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (MAR 2000) The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof. Contractor further agrees to hold the NAFI harmless from all claims or judgments for damages resulting from the use of products or services listed in this contract, except for such claims or damages caused by, or resulting from negligence of NAFI customers, employees, agents, or representatives. Also, Contractor shall at all times hold and save harmless the NAFI, its agents, representatives, and employees from any and all suits, claims, charges, and expenses which arise out of acts or omissions of Contractor, its agents, representatives, or employees.</p>

Except as may be otherwise provided in this contract, the contract price includes all taxes, duties or other public charges in effect and applicable to this contract on the contract date, except any tax, duty, or other public charge, which by law, regulation or governmental agreement, is not applicable to expenditures made by the NAFI or on its behalf; or any tax, duty, or other public charge from which the Contractor, or any subcontractor hereunder, is exempt by law, regulation or otherwise. If any such tax, duty, or other public charge has been included in the contract price, through error or otherwise, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced.<br />b. If for any reason, after the contract date of execution, the Contractor or subcontractor is relieved in whole or in part from the payment or the burden of any tax, duty, or other public charge included in the contract price, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced; or if the Contractor or subcontractor is required to pay in whole or in part any tax, duty, of other public charge which was not applicable at the contract date of execution the contract price shall be correspondingly increased.</p>
<p>18. PROOF OF SHIPMENT (MAR 2000) (Applicable to shipments outside the United States through the Defense Transportation System [DTS] and Parcel Post shipments to overseas destinations.)<br />a.

A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point (CCP or POE) is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment.<br />b. Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications.<br />c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to (i) exceptions taken at the time of inspection, and (ii) latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud.</p>
<p>19. COMMERCIAL WARRANTY (MAR 2000) The Contractor agrees that the supplies or services furnished under this contract shall be covered by the most favorable commercial warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such supplies or services and that the rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the NAFI by any other clause of this contract. The printed terms and conditions of such warranty will be provided to the NAFI with the delivery of any supplies covered.</p>
<p>20. ADVERTISEMENTS (MAR 2000) Contractor agrees that none of its nor its agent's advertisements, to include publications, merchandise, promotions, coupons, sweepstakes, contest, sales brochures, etc, shall state, infer or imply that the Contractor's products or services are approved, promoted, or endorsed by the NAFI. Any advertisement, including cents off coupons, which refers to a NAFI will contain a statement that the advertisement is neither paid for, nor sponsored in whole or in part by, the particular activity.</p>
<p>21. DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT (MAR 2000) <br />a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices. <br />b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day.</p>
<p>22. INVOICES (MAR 2000):<br />a. An invoice is a written request for payment under the contract for supplies delivered or for services rendered. In order to be proper, an invoice should include (and in order to support the payment of interest penalties, must include) the following:<br />(i) Invoice date; <br />(ii) Name of Contractor; <br />(iii) Contract number (including order number, if any), contract line item number, contract description of supplies or services, quantity, contract unit of measure and unit price, and extended total;<br />(iv) Shipment number and date of shipment (Bill of Lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government Bills of Lading)<br />(v) Name and address to which payment is to be sent (which must be the same as that in the contract or on a proper notice of assignment);<br />(vi) Name (where practicable), title, phone number and mailing address of person to be notified in event of a defective invoice; and <br />(vii) Any other information or documentation required by other provisions of the contract (such as evidence of shipment). Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate (one copy shall be marked Original") unless otherwise specified. <br />b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97 177): <br />(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred.<br />(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated. <br />(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 2O") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates. <br />(iv) The following periods of time will not be included:<br />(A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other cases, and<br />(B) Between the date of a notice of any defect or impropriety and the date a proper invoice is received.

<p>25. NON WAIVER OF DEFAULTS (MAR 2000) - Any failure by the NAFI at any time, or from time to time, to enforce or require strict performance of any terms or conditions of this contract will not constitute waiver thereof and will not affect or impair such terms or conditions in any way or the NAFI's right at any time to avail itself of such remedies as it may have for any breach or breaches of such terms and conditions<br /><br />LIST OF FAR CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE</p>

<DESC><p><br />COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation ("synopsitation" hereafter), which is expected to result in award of a pre-priced blanket purchase agreement (BPA), etc. for commercial items, as described under the paragraph below titled "Requirement."&nbsp; The synopsitation is prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. An agreement, if any, will be made with the responsible offeror who submits a proposal that (1) conforms to the requirements of the synopsitation; (2) represents the best value to the Government, prices and factors considered. The Contracting Officer may choose to issue multiple awards. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions or make no award at all depending upon (1) the quality of proposals received and (2) the price fair and reasonableness of proposals received.</p>
<p>Synopsitation Number: FA8601-16-A-0001</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 621511</p>
<p>Requirement: The 88 MDG is tasked to perform various lab tests to assist with diagnosing patient maladies. The Government does not have the in house capability to perform all tests required. Services are to be provided in accordance with the Performance Work Statement, which is located at Attachment 1.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer (CO) has determined that a Pre-Priced Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) is the most appropriate method for procuring this requirement. A BPA is a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing "charge accounts" with qualified sources of supply. Supplies or services are ordered by placing calls against the BPA by personnel authorized by the CO to make such calls. The contractor provides the supplies or performs the services covered under the BPA IAW the BPA Terms of Agreement at the prices on the price list approved by the CO. The contractor submits price lists for the CO's approval, which are valid for a specific period of time (normally one year); i.e. 16 Nov 2015 through 15 Nov 2020. The BPA will be written for a period of five (5) years, during which the Government is only obligated for authorized purchases made under the BPA. Therefore, a BPA does not include a minimum purchase requirement or maximum dollar limitation. The Government is not obligated to make any calls against the BPA, which may be cancelled by the Government or the contractor in accordance with the cancellation terms specified in the BPA Terms of Agreement. For additional information on BPAs refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.303.</p>
<p>All prospective awardees are required to register in the System for Award Management (SAM) and to maintain active registration during the life of the contract. SAM can be accessed at https://www.sam.gov. Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov. Prior to BPA award, your company must be registered with SAM.</p>
<p>All Contractors must also have a DUNS number. The DUNS number is a nine-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services. If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A DUNS number will be <br />Provided immediately by telephone at no charge to the offeror. For information on obtaining a DUNS number, the offeror, if located within the United States, should call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505. The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;Company name.<br />(2)&nbsp;Company address.<br />(3)&nbsp;Company telephone number.<br />(4)&nbsp;Line of business.<br />(5)&nbsp;Chief executive officer/key manager.<br />(6)&nbsp;Date the company was started.<br />(7)&nbsp;Number of people employed by the company.<br />(8)&nbsp;Company affiliation.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

<p><strong>FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS</strong><br />Provide a complete price list for the following food &amp; beverage requirements. These requirements are an estimate and we will select items from the catering menu provided.</p>
<p>**Each day, most of our participants will eat lunch in the hotel restaurant or off-site. Many do choose to eat in the hotel restaurant, so please staff the restaurant accordingly from Tuesday to Thursday. In addition to those participants eating in the restaurant or off-site, we have several working meetings scheduled throughout our event with 8-30 participants each. For these instances, we would like to offer participants the ability to order self-pay meals beforehand that will be delivered or picked up by participants. If lunches are to be picked up by participants, we will need several pay stations operating to ensure that working lunch meeting participants can pay for lunches quickly and have ample time to meet. We have typically offered box lunches with a pre-order form. The pre-order form contains five options or a menu that varies each day.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>Q - I have a question about the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation posted to FBO under solicitation number VA11816R0842.

Is this a follow-on requirement? If so, could you please provide the incumbent contract number for this opportunity?  If not, is this a new requirement?

A - This was originally awarded as an Interagency Agreement (IA) with Department of Interior (DOI) for Veterans Affairs (VA) Financial Service Center under DOI contract number D11PC18974 under the Small Business Administration 8(a) program.  VA decided not to exercise the last option period under the IA with DOI and is anticipating awarding a new competitive contract under the 8(a) program.  A bridge contract, number VA118-15-C-0373, was awarded for two months, which will expire October 31, 2015.  This effort is to provide an additional bridge contract until the new competitive contract is awarded.

See PWS paragraph 1.2.2.</p>
<p>4. Describe your approach to performing maintenance of AAF responsible aircraft IAW PWS paragraph 3.2.4.</p>
<p>5. Remobilization. Since Afghanistan is an unstable environment there is the possibility that the contractor would have to relocate to another base during the contract period.

<p><br />NOTE: <br />While researching the questions the contractors have sent I uncovered that this building is on the National Register of Historic Places. That means that "All new windows units shall be similar to original windows in terms of style, operation, pane configuration, and tinting" The contractor can install thicker materials but the windows should look and function like the old.</p>
<p>I had during the site visit mentioned that initially my thoughts were to allow contractors to modify the configuration, but that is not the case. Please do not vary from the plans which are clearly defined on Drawing A1 Note 9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions from 2nd site visit will be posted when available and new specs will be issued concerning window.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Added:&nbsp; 23 Oct 15<br />The government will not be releasing an RFP this month. Prior to requesting clearance to release the RFP, the team was asked to take a look at other potential incentives to ensure the government provides CSDs to the warfighter. After several weeks of data collection and evaluation it was determined that PBL offers adequate incentive for potential awardees.
<p>That said; the government has revised the SOW to clarify some of the 125+ comments posed by industry. The revised SOW is posted within this FBO announcement. In addition, the flying hours will have some changes. For instance, the government will now solicit for 10 years' worth of A-10 CSD requirements. For NSN to CLIN consistency for option years, please notice that the CLIN formerly numbered 0013 (A-10) is now 0012/1012. The CLIN formerly numbered 0012 is now CLIN 0013. The government will advise on the contract maximum value at a later date and the current number stated in the attached contract line items may be revised.</p>
<p>The government team has been asked to review the GFP attachment related to Air Force managed items, specifically to consider maintaining a "safety-stock". The government expects to reduce the amount of AF items and/or quantity of those items. The government estimates completion of this review on or about 30 Oct 15.</p>
<p>The government will be changing the CDRL for contract status reporting to require status report forecasts of 30/60/90 day contract status. The government estimates completion of this CDRL on or about 30 Oct 15.</p>
<p>The government has posted a revised SOW within this FBO announcement The government anticipates this change will slip RFP release date to mid-Nov to early Dec timeframe with responses due around mid Jan to early Feb 16.<br /><br />Attached:&nbsp; Revised Contract Line Item Schedule<br />Attached:&nbsp; Revised Price Matrix<br />Attached:&nbsp; Revised Statement of Work<br />Attached:&nbsp; Revised Inquiry and Comment Tracker dated 23 Oct 15</p>

<DESC>FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i): The contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name, or industrial mobilization).
<p>The Survey Vessel Shuman was operating in the Delaware River performing required surveys in various Reaches of the Delaware River and Bay as part of the deepening project. An oil analysis taken from the starboard engine revealed significant problems with the starboard main propulsion engine on the SHUMAN. The OEM, Detroit Diesel, recommended that the engine not be used until these problems are corrected. The diagnosis by Detroit Diesel indicated that an in-place rebuild of this engine is required. <br /><br />If the SHUMAN is not returned to operational status quickly, the impact on the District's dredging mission will be significantly impacted. The SHUMAN is the only District vessel capable of performing the required surveys in various Reaches of the Delaware River and Bay as part of the Deepening project. With dredging currently scheduled, it is critical that the engine be rebuilt so the SHUMAN can be returned to operational status ASAP. Should these repairs be delayed, the financial impact on the District will be substantial, as the two dredges scheduled to dredge these areas will not be able to perform their mission, due to a lack of surveying data. The cost of these dredges is approximately $100,000 per day per dredge.<br /><br />See posted J&amp;A for additional rational.</p>

This modification provides for continuing systems engineering and technical assistance services for the B61-12 Life Extension Program (LEP) while the competitive source selection for these services is ongoing. The original J&amp;A supporting this action was approved on 06 July 2015. The J&amp;A was amended on 05 August 2015 to provide additional incremental funding through 30 September 2015 because the competitive source selection is still ongoing. This current J&amp;A amendment extends the estimated period of performance of the B61 LEP gap services effort from 01 October 2015 through 28 February 2016, and incremental funding will be provided up to a total amount of $1,750,000 as necessary to maintain services until award of the competitive task order.</p>
