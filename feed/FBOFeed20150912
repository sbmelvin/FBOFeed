8.	All System equipment installed or supplied by the service provider shall remain their property and shall not be tampered with or modified in any way by the VA Medical Center.  All System equipment furnished shall be of good quality, and shall be maintained during the term of this agreement in a careful and proper manner, conforming to all applicable codes, regulations and industry standards.

9.	Installation work shall conform in every way to VA and Medical Center safety policy and regulations, particularly as they apply toward matters regulated by OSHA and the National Fire Protection Administration (NFPA), including the use of approved fire-stopping materials when firewalls are breached, for obtaining permits as required for firewall penetrations, for obtaining confined space permits for work below the ground surface or in other confined spaces, and for following all confined space policy, and for ensuring that cables do not impede fire alarm and sprinkler systems or utilize these system components for cable support.   Any electrical work or equipment must conform to the National Electrical Code.

10.	The Service Provider shall use their best effort to respond to all requests for repair of the System at the premises or to System outages within four (4) hours of the request.   The provider shall only respond to trouble calls originating from the Electric Shop Supervisor during normal administrative hours, or from the Administrative Officer of the Day (AOD) during off-duty hours, weekends and Federal Holidays.

11.	Repairs shall be at no cost to the VA, except for any damages to System equipment which results from negligence, abuse, accidents, mishaps that were created by VA staff, patients, contractors or visitors.

Service provider shall not be liable for network problems outside of the medical center which are beyond their control.

12.	 The TV signals shall be of high quality and equal to the service standards being applied to the outside community.

13.	VA shall provide Service Provider reasonable access to the premises as may be necessary to install, service, extend, remove, modify or maintain the System and otherwise perform its obligations under this agreement, and immediate access in the event of an emergency or system outage.  Upon arrival during normal administrative hours, Monday through Friday, 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM, and prior to any commencement of maintenance work, the Electric Shop Supervisor (Office:  973-676-1000 Ext. 1581, Cell Phone: 908-413-3140) or designated alternate, shall be contacted. During off-duty tours, evenings, weekends and Federal holidays, the Service representative is to contact the Utility Operator at Extension 1601 or Pager 500 via the telephone operator.

14.	The Service provider is reserved the rights to make channel lineup changes, however, if there are material changes in the composition or number of channel services provided, the VA may initiate discussions to renegotiate the monthly fees payable under this agreement.  In the event that a mutually satisfactory agreement cannot be reached, the VA reserves the right to terminate this agreement upon six (6) months written notice.

15.	VA will use reasonable care to ensure that its patients, guests and employees do not, copy, tape or record programs being provided, or tamper with, make alterations to, or remove from its point of installation, the wires, cables or equipment supplied, or in such a way that may permit the receipt of unauthorized services or to transmit services to an unauthorized outlet, which would constitute theft of services.

16.	VA shall pay a monthly fee per TV outlet based on the distribution of the Service to all non-private-account TV outlets, with TVs connected to them, throughout the premises.

The 42nd Contracting Squadron at Maxwell AFB, AL intends to award a sole source contract to Alabama Controls, Inc, 6900 State Highway 180, Gulf Shores, AL 36542-8066 for the purchase of software and readers in compliance with the system already in place (see Attachment 1).

The software currently in place is out of date of the new FIPS encryption. This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This will be a firm-fixed price contract for the specified period of performance. If there are any other businesses that can provide the specified services, they must respond to this notice before 9/17/15 at 4:00pm Central Standard Time (CST). If no responses are received by the above referenced date/time a sole source contract will be awarded to Alabama Controls, Inc.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Bureau of Land Management Nevada State Office intends to award a sole source purchase order to Howard S. Goldbaum to provide equipment and convert BLMs existing two-dimensional high definition 360-degree photographic node data already complied for the American Flat Mill (AFM) online virtual tour into an appropriate format to facilitate pseudo three-dimensional viewing using a head mounted display (HMD).
Based on market research conducted the BLM has determined that the equipment required to display the pseudo three dimensional view of the American Flat Mill in a head mounted display is available in the commercial marketplace, however this requirement expands on this need to include the expertise required to take the existing nodes (created by the contractor) and convert them to the required format to make the Oculus Rift or similar head mounted display (HMD). The contractor has been conducting experiments using the Oculus Rift Virtual Reality (VR) headset or HMD for the AFM virtual tour. The HMD virtual tour would put the viewer right into the virtual space instead of just viewing it sitting in front of a computer monitor. The HMD technology would also be available for viewing on compatible mobile devices connected to the internet.

If you believe your company can meet the requirement listed above, please contact Kim Ferguson via email at k1fergus@blm.gov prior to 4pm PST on September 17, 2015.

<SOLNBR>N4008515T9115
<CONTACT>
<DESC>NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic (Public Works Department (PWD) Oceana) intends to award a Firm Fixed Price, Sole Source purchase order to Siemens Industry, Inc. of Richmond, Virginia, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  The contracting officer has determined the circumstances of the contract action deems only one source reasonably available to provide equipment and installation services to replace an inoperable secondary breaker within the secondary unit substation secondary switchgear at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia Beach, Virginia.  It is in the best interests of the Government to continue using the same model that is currently installed within the original 1950’s switchgear.  

Siemens Industry Inc.
 acquired the maker of the original breakers, I.T.E Circuit Breaker Company in the 1980’s, and, therefore, has the technical ability to recondition the 1950’s era I.T.E. breakers.  PWD Oceana will use Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition to solicit a quotation for a single source simplified acquisition purchase order.   The proposed contract action is for construction services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. This Notice of Intent is not a request for quotation. No solicitation or RFQ will be forthcoming. Interested parties may identify their interest and submit capability information in response to this notice by 2:00PM Eastern Standard Time, Wednesday, September 16, 2015 via email to Keith Logan at keith.o.logan@navy.mil.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action is solely at the discretion of the Government.
 Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 236220, and the SBA size standard is $36.5 million.

<p>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, notice of intent. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. AG-5522-S-15-0004 is being issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ).

For a small company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees or less.</p>
<p>The Midwest Area for the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture intends to issue an award based on a brand name justification. This is a Brand Name Procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. However, it has been determined through market research that other vendors may be able to fulfill this brand name requirement. The USDA, ARS, MWA, Soil Drainage Research Unit, Columbus, OH. has a requirement for a Campbell Scientific Eddy Covariance CO2/H2O Open-Path Gas Analyzer System (EC 150). These systems are standardized across a number of sites in the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) Network. The Eddy Covariance CO2/H2O Open-Path Gas Analyzer System (EC 150) is a highly specialized assembly of sophisticated instrumentation and control equipment. The Soil Drainage Research Unit in Columbus, Ohio operates the Eastern Corn Belt (ECBS)site in the ARS Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) Network. The LTAR network is comprised of eighteen research sites across the U.S., and it is necessary that all sites have commonly manufactured instrumentation for climate data collection in order to limit scientific variability and ensure scientific integrity. The ARS Office of National Programs (ONP) has directed that all sites, including the Eastern Corn Belt Site, LTAR, also install Campbell Scientific Eddy Covariance CO2/H2O Open-Path Gas Analyzer Systems and have provided funds for this purpose. While some sites have legacy equipment configured with other suppliers, ONP has strongly encouraged that sites purchasing new equipment conform to this design and equipment.

This contract action is for supplies and/or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within five (5) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <strong>Any quotation/response should be emailed to the Contract Specialist, Lee Catherine Kennedy, at LCKennedy@cdc.gov by 10:00am EDT, Thursday, 17 September 2015.</strong></p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>This solicitation, NB647020-15-04257, is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-84.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333912, with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This is a total small business set-aside.</p>
<p>This combined synopsis/solicitation is for the following commercial item(s):</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: One (1) Hydrogen Compressor</p>
<p>Description of requirements for the items to be acquired:</p>
<p>PURPOSE:<br />The mission of the Hydrogen Pipeline Safety Project is to test different materials in an environment of pressurized hydrogen gas. These tests are conducted at a pressure range of 250 psi to 20,000 psi. In order to obtain these pressures we must have a gas compressor that is compatible with the safety and purity issues associated with hydrogen. For example, it should have an explosion-proof motor or be capable of operating safely in a hydrogen environment, and it must be a compressor that will not introduce contamination, specifically O2 or H2O.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: <br />We need a free-standing hydrogen compressor, appropriate for laboratory testing. It should be capable of maintaining 6-nines hydrogen purity. Any compressor will be evaluated in our lab with our standard procedures, and a gas sample sent to Atlantic Analytical Laboratory for analysis. If the sampled gas exceeds 2 ppm O2 or 2 ppm H2O, the compressor will be rejected. The compressor will typically be used multiple times/day by an automated system (no human monitoring), so it must perform reliably, on demand. The footprint should be no larger than 6 feet by 6 feet.</p>
<p>An input pressure somewhere between 50 and 200 psi whereby the flowrate is at least 2 scfm. We do not expect the flowrate to remain that high if the input pressure drops below the manufacturer's recommended value, but we should be able to drain the supply bottle to 50 psi or less.</p>
<p>Ouput pressure of at least 5500 psi.</p>
<p>Explosion-proof motor or non-sparking drive, as this unit will operate inside the laboratory.</p>
<p>We already have a working system, therefore, we do not need all of the ancillary equipment, such as pressure switches, bypass valves, etc. However, the unit should have manual valving for pump priming when diaphragms are changed and we need to get the air out of the oil side for priming.</p>
<p>Installation not required</p>
<p>10 days for acceptance</p>
<p>Delivery requested by December 1, 2015</p>
<p><br />BASIS OF AWARD:</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable quoter. This will be a firm fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor submitting a quote that meets all of the requirements of this RFQ and who has the lowest price.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement for a firm fixed price construction contract for 8th Street Improvements, Bristol, TN/VA.   <br>      <br>   SCOPE OF WORK:   The 8th Street Improvements are designed to reduce flooding in downtown Bristol, TN/VA in combination with other three alternatives built elsewhere in Bristol TN/VA. The 8th Street project site is located on Beaver Creek at approximate river mile 14.9 and consists of four main elements:   <br>      <br>   Channelization of Beaver Creek - approximately 680 linear feet of channelization of the left descending bank of the creek. The cut-slope will be lined with articulated concrete block to protect the slope from erosion.   <br>      <br>   Demolition of the 8th Street Bridge - the concrete arch two-lane bridge will be completely removed to facilitate channelization and improve flow in Beaver Creek. The bridge will not be replaced.    <br>      <br>   Demolition of the existing pedestrian bridge - the existing bridge (on Wes Davis Greenway) was constructed on top of an old railroad bridge that has numerous timber piers constructed at an angle to the direction of the flow in Beaver Creek. The piers act as a trash screen, collecting debris and blocking the already limited flow.   <br>       <br>   Construction of new pedestrian bridge - to replace the demolished pedestrian bridge, a new single span steel arch bridge will be constructed immediately downstream. The bridge will have a span of approximately 102 feet.   <br>      <br>      <br>   The estimated magnitude range is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.   <br>      <br>  A site visit is scheduled for Friday, August 21, 2015, beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT) (9:00 a.m. CDT). Participants are to meet at 324 8th Street, Bristol, TN 37620. Any questions after the site visit MUST be submitted in writing by 2:00 p.m. CDT on Wednesday, August 26, 2015 to Contract Specialist Kristal Jones at Kristal.R.Jones@usace.army.mil. <br>  <br> Solicitation Amendment: Amendment 1 is being issued to provide for a revised bidding schedule, revised technical pages, and to extend the bid opening date to Friday, September 18, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. Central Daylight Savings Time (CDT).
