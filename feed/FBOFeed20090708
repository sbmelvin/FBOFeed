STATEMENT OF WORK
Contract Period:17 July 2009 through 07 August 2009
Background: In October 2008, a non-native rat eradication was conducted on Rat Island, part of Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. The eradication was accomplished through the use of a rodenticide which was spread across the island.  In the spring of 2009, a crew was stationed on Rat Island to search for signs of any surviving rats and evidence of secondary poisoning of non-target organisms.  Results of the search found no sign of rats, but evidence of possible secondary poisoning of raptors and scavenging birds.  Carcasses of all birds were collected and removed from the environment.  Carcasses and tissues that may still have value for analysis were brought to Anchorage, AK for further study.  These carcasses and tissues must be examined by a board certified veterinary pathologist to assess the cause of death and prepare tissues for further analysis by an independent laboratory.  This information will allow the agency to determine pathways through which these birds may have been exposed.
Goals: The goal of this project is to determine the cause of death for birds collected at Rat Island in the spring of 2009.   Information gained through this process will provide critical information related to pathways through which non-target species may have been exposed to rodenticide and how this can be avoided with any future eradication effort. Objectives: 
Provision of board certified veterinary pathology services for full necropsies, histopathology, tissue preparation and related consultations.
Specimens:
Bald Eagles:  17 carcasses Glaucous winged Gulls: 26 carcasses Waterfowl: 2 carcassesOther seabirds: 3 carcassesPasserine birds: 7 carcasses

Collection and preparation of tissues for storage and subsequent analysis.4.	Preparation of additional tissues for ancillary diagnostics.5.	Determine age class and sex of eagle carcasses.6.	Maintain chain of custody.7.	Provide written report of results. Deliverables:
1.	Results and interpretation of full diagnostic necropsy in writing.2.	Two sets of tissue samples from each suitable carcass for immediate and future analysis.3.	Two sets of tissue samples from additional samples collected at Rat Island for immediate and future analysis.4.	Guidance on any follow-up analytical work required as indicated by the results of the necropsy.
Period of Performance: 
17 July 2009 through 07/August 2009. Billing will occur at completion of necropsy events, preparation of tissues and following submission of necropsy report to USFWS. 
Non-disclosure
Results of the analysis will only be provided to appropriate representatives of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

If performance of a service exceeds the AQL, the HNC will not pay the full percentage in column 5 for that service.  The maximum payment percentage for service in column 5 of the PRS is multipled by the percentage of the area found acceptable.  The resulting percentage is the percentage of the monthly contract price that the Contractor will be paid for the listed service.  The total number of defects found, not just the defects in excess of the reject level, is used to determine the percentage of the lot found unacceptable.  The percentage of the area found unacceptabled subtracted from 100% determine the percentage of the area found acceptable.E.	Example:  Assume an AQL of 5%, a total number of 100 units, and that ten defects were found by the COTR.  The payment would be computed as follows:(1)  Maximum contract line item payment per month	$10,000(2)  Maximum payment percentage for service (column 5)	25%(3)  Maximum payment for acceptable service		$2,500(4)  Ten defects (exceed the reject level of 5 defects)	(5)  Percentage of units found unacceptable			10%(6)  Percentage of units found acceptable			90%(7)  Payment for percentage of acceptable service	$2,250

In all cases, the Government will make the decision whether the potential benefit of a particular design modification warrants the change. Depending upon the extent of accepted design changes, the Government will unilaterally decide which tests must be repeated to validate the predicted performance improvement. The vendors will be paid for CLIN001 when the first articles are delivered and accepted by the Government.</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to procure the services of The University of Massachusetts (UMA) Medical Center, 300 Massachusetts Ave., Amherst, MA 01003 to collect blood, saliva, hair samples, assay of blood, saliva and hair samples for Cortisol and Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), dominance testing and behavioral observations, animal car duties, behavioral data assay and statistical analyses.  The above services will be carried out by UMAs research assistants with undergraduate and graduate students support.  The Institute intends to procure these services by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302.
This is an ongoing joint project investigating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning, dominance hierarchies, social proximity and object manipulation in rhesus monkey groups housed in different environments with the department of Psychology at the UMA.  These assays are part of a long-term collaborative research project with the Laboratory of Comparative Ethology (LCE) in which direct comparisons are being made on the above neurochemical and behavioral measures between a group of LCE monkeys living in a 5-acre outdoor enclosure at the NIH Animal Center (NIHAC), whose founding members were reared under surrogate-peer laboratory conditions and the UMA monkey groups whose founding members were reared under identical conditions but now have been maintained in indoor pens, rather than outdoors like the LCE monkeys.  The new data collection and assays will not only continue comparisons between the founder members of the LCE and UMA monkey groups, but also between the second, third and fourth generation members of the respective groups.  The UMA monkey groups are unique in terms of their match with the LCE founder members.  
The methodologies and specifications will remain the same as they have been in the previous years in order to maintain consistency for the ongoing project.  The services needed will primary be done @ the UMA.  Behavioral and biological data collected from the LCE monkeys at the NIHAC that are relevant for statistical comparisons with the UMA data will be furnished to the UMA by the LCE, NICHD. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however, all responses received, within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC><p><strong>RECOVERY - In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-5, the Government posts this notice of intent to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ).</strong>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Ocean Service, Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services, Engineering Division, Chesapeake, VA has a requirement to purchase satellite communication equipment. The equipment is due for delivery no later than July 28, 2009. <strong>This procurement is a TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.</strong> The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees or less. The Federal Supply Class (FSC) is 6660. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement utilizing simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Request for Quotations is only available on line by downloading from this site. In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, ALL CONTRACTORS must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a Federal contract. For information regarding registration in CCR, contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm. Additionally, each offeror must obtain, and provide with the quote, their nine-digit Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Quotes are to remain effective for 30 days after close of solicitation. Contractors are encouraged to register with the FedBizOpps Vendor Notification Service. Potential offerors may direct all inquiries pertaining to the solicitation in writing to Janie Laferty at Janie.M.Laferty@noaa.gov or faxed to 757-664-3645. Telephone requests will not be honored. This is a Commercial Acquisition and Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 12 apply.</p>
<p>Name Brand Justification for ED-Iridium Modems</p>
<p><br />The NLA research Iridium modems and support equipment are used at remote CO-OPS environmental monitoring stations on the Atlantic coast, the Gulf of Mexico coast, throughout the Pacific, and in coastal areas of Alaska. This purchase is to support new hydrographic stations in Alaska. Implementing different types of modems and support equipment will result in additional cost and resources. Also, there will be resulting delay for testing, training, and purchase of support equipment.</p>
<p>&bull; Under the current CO-OPS operating system any equipment used in environmental monitoring that has not previously been approved must be subjected to a series of tests to ensure the quality of the system and the durability of the equipment for the intended use. These tests usually include bench testing using controlled conditions and physical measurement, controlled environmental testing to check the equipment's reliability under different conditions, and long term comparison testing with accepted equipment at multiple real world locations. These tests and the analysis of the resulting data take a large amount of time, money, and resources to conduct. <br />&bull; The CO-OPS environmental monitoring systems are designed to operate with the components in this purchase. Implementing different components will result in compatibility issues.<br />&bull; If a different modem is used additional time and funds will be required for software development and test to assure that data can be transmitted and received by existing CO-OPS systems using the different modem.<br />&bull; Currently CO-OPS field personal and contractors are trained in the use and maintenance of the modems and components in this purchase. Additional cost will incur from having to train field personal and contractors on the use and maintenance of new equipment. <br />&bull; CO-OPS also has the ability and equipment to test and repair the modems and components in this purchase. If new equipment is purchased additional parts and equipment will need to be purchased to support the new equipment. Additional training will also be required for those tasked with testing and repairing this equipment.</p>

SOLICITATION NUMBER:  N2011090462PROPOSED ISSUE DATE:  On or about July 22, 2009TITLE OF PROJECT:  Construct Visitor Emergency Operations Center, Hawaii Volcanoes National ParkDESCRIPTION:  This project constructs a Visitor Emergency Operations Center (VEOC) on the site of the existing Ranger Station.  The VEOC will house staff for Law Enforcement, Fire, Eruption, and Dispatch, as well as an area to hold detainees held by Law Enforcement.  The VEOC will also include an Incident Command Center, Emergency Response, Critical Incident Stress Management, and Dispatch Center.  The building will be used to provide 24-hour Dispatch for over 9 million visitors per year throughout the Pacific Islands and daily assistance to Park visitors, law enforcement, fire, and dispatch.  The dispatch center serves the isolated, local communities and partners with county emergency services.  In catastrophic events, these three functions require total monitoring, communication, and coordination with each other and outside sources for the health and safety of all visitors.  
Although not historic, the existing Ranger Station is located within the historic Kilauea Administration and Maintenance Area; thus, sensitivity to on-going Park operations, existing structures, and the Park visitor experience are imperative.  The structure will be approximately 4,700 square feet in size and include specialized construction to meet Dispatch and Command Center code requirements; for example, specialized construction includes CMU construction, redundant HVAC and electrical support systems, emergency back-up power, seismic upgrades, security access, and all other requirements as identified within NFPA 1221.

All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately EQUAL in importance to price.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 15.300, the government will select the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the BEST VALUE to the government, price and technical and other factors considered.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; and permits discussions if necessary.  The government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the government to be the most advantageous to the government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Pre-Solicitation Announcement

The Federal Government has a requirement for the construction and full service leasing of a new Wildlife Disease Research Building (WDRB) to be located at 4101 LaPorte Avenue, Fort Collins, Colorado on land to be leased from Colorado State University.  The building will be occupied entirely by U.S. Department of Agriculture and other Federal tenants as determined by the General Services Administration.

The National Wildlife Research Center (NRWC) presently has a long term ground lease with Colorado State University.  The successful Offeror will enter into a ground lease with the University and a full service building lease with the General Services Administration (GSA).  The proposed building shall contain approximately 13,000 BOMA office area (useable) square feet of office and laboratory space for use by the tenant for personnel, furnishings, equipment, and public use areas.  The space shall be designed and constructed to meet the requirements of a self-contained Bio-Safety Level (BSL)-3 Laboratory and BSL-3 Ag animal holding and testing space.  The building must be capable of being fully accessible to the physically handicapped, must meet minimum seismic requirements and will be subject to any and all other building or construction rules, regulations, laws and/or ordinances on the local, county, state and federal levels as they may apply.

The Government may enter into a sole source procurement with Colorado State University in the event interested party(ies) are unable to indicate they are highly qualified to meet the Government’s requirements for past performance.  In making such a determination, GSA will consider past performance factors including the ability to finance, develop, construct and provide full service operation of facilities of similar complexity.  Interested parties will also need to provide evidence that they are able to secure the necessary land lease from CSU.  

The government is seeking a 20-year firm term lease with two 5-year options.  The General Service Administration does not have the Authority or does not intend to seek authority to award a lease that exceeds the congressionally imposed Prospectus Threshold.  Such space shall be ready for occupancy no later than fall of 2012.

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any Expressions of Interests or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building’s ownership.

<DESC>INFORMATIONAL QUOTES
TO DETERMINE THE SUITABILITY
FOR A FORMAL ACQUISITION

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) 
Washington National Records Center

This is a request for informational quotes by the General Services Administration to determine the suitability for a formal acquisition of a lease net of electric, sewer, and water for warehouse and office space.  The Federal Government has a requirement to lease 230,000 BOMA rentable square feet for the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) of the Mid-Atlantic region.  The proposed building must yield approximately 20,000 BOMA useable square feet of office and administrative space and 210,000 BOMA useable square feet of contiguous warehouse space.  The site shall be able to accommodate 60 on-site parking spaces available for visitors, handicap and employees.  The lease shall have an initial term of up to ten (10) years with an option to renew the lease for an additional five (5) years.

The delineated area of consideration is as follows:

North - Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road) to the outer loop of the Baltimore Beltway, I-695
West - Maryland/Virginia Route 15 to Virginia Route 20 (Constitution Highway)
South - Virginia Route 20 to Route 3 until Fredericksburg (including all of Stafford County, Virginia)
East - from Stafford County, Virginia along the western shoreline of the Chesapeake Bay to Ft. Howard, Maryland including the outer loop of I-695 around to Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road)

GSA is interested in sites for new construction or existing facilities that meet the following minimum requirements.  The proposed location must be currently zoned for the intended use and the development must be planned and approved by the local jurisdiction.  The site cannot be located within a floodplain or a wetland.  GSA may request site studies regarding wildlife, storm water management, soil conditions, deforestation plans, and/or traffic studies.  Building infrastructure (water, sewer, utilities) to the proposed site must be in place or readily available, and the site must have paved access to major highways.  The proposed building requires a 100 foot setback from parking areas and roads. The proposed site to accommodate the facility could range from 12 to 17 acres and must be secured by a fence.  

The proposed facility must comply with fire safety, security, and other records protection requirements as stated in 36 CFR 1228 Subpart K, available at:
http://www.archives.gov/about/regulations/part-1228/k.html

WAREHOUSE/RECORDS SPACE - The warehouse facility shall consist of five (5) records storage bays (approximately 210,000 usable square feet) consisting of two (2) temporary records bays at 42,000 square feet each, and three  (3) permanent records storage bays at 42,000 square feet each.  ALL storage bays must meet the Federal records storage requirements outlined in 36 CFR 1228 Subpart K.  In addition, the permanent bays will require office-type air conditioning 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  
  
Offerors are specifically placed on notice that requirements for some building elements exceed the normal "warehouse" standards.  The Office of Regional Records Services, the Space and Security Division, and the Office of Preservation Programs of the National Archives and Records Administration will provide technical assistance and oversight in identifying specific design features, and particularly those which must be built into the permanent records storage areas during construction.

The record storage space should have a minimum of fifteen feet, one inch clear stacking height above finished floor.  The space must be contiguous and the major segments individually must be fully occupiable on a priority and phased basis from start of build out/construction over an estimated one-year to one and one-half year period.  All office, records storage, and records handling equipment, such as furniture, ladders, carts, pallets, and forklifts are to be furnished by the Government at no cost to the Offeror.  The Offeror shall provide the shelving.

OFFICE/ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE - The office facility shall be a Class A space.  It is to be functionally located in relation to the records storage bays for efficient operations.  All offices and rooms located along the exterior walls shall have windows unless otherwise specified in this document. It shall be fully sprinklered (light hazard).  The finished ceiling shall be at least 9 feet, but not more than 11 feet AFF.  Lighting in the office areas shall be recessed.  The finished room sizes are minimum “wall-to-wall” net usable requirements, exclusive of any building common factors or circulation factors.  The Government will allow for a dimensional variance of +/- 6” or a room size variance of 2%.  Enclosed rooms located adjacent to the records storage bays must have 2-hour fire rated walls for the single wall that is adjacent to the bay.  Processing rooms, work areas including conference rooms, research room and lobby shall have office-level HVAC with multiple zones and units based on room function.  All internal circulation paths must be a minimum of 60 inches wide.

Employee services, such as moderately priced restaurants, banks, public transportation shall be available within a 10.0 mile radius of the facility.

<DESC>The United States Government currently leases approximately 35,726 RSF of warehouse and related space at 6295 Edsall Road, Alexandria, VA, under a lease that expires on October 30, 2010.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 35,726 contiguous RSF of warehouse and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 35,000 contiguous usable square feet of warehouse and related space.  Approximately 2,500 RSF of the space will be used as standard office space.  Offered space must provide four foot high loading docks at a minimum rate of one per bay, with no fewer than four docks altogether, a minimum clear ceiling height of 24-feet, and minimum floor load of 250 pounds per RSF.  All offered bays must have access to handicap accessible restrooms.  On site parking must be available for Government use in accordance with local code, or in the absence of a local code at a rate of one space per 1,000 RSF of leased space.  Occupancy is required no later than October 30, 2010.

LEASE TERM:
The lease term will be a firm term of five (5) years, with an option to renew for one (1) additional five (5) year term.  Effective upon the commencement of the third year of the initial lease term, the Government shall have a one-time right to terminate, and return to the lessor, marketable blocks of space in a total amount of up to 11,500 RSF, which right may be exercised by providing 180 days advance written notice. 

DELINEATED AREA:
All properties offered to the Government in conjunction with this requirement must be located in Northern Virginia within a 5-mile radius from the Government’s current location at 6295 Edsall Road, Alexandria, VA.

7)	Name, address, telephone number, and email address of individual to be contacted.

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or to relocate to alternative space.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.

The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  The Government’s decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.  In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Government’s requirements.  With specific respect to expected rental rate information, the Government will assume a maximum rental rate above which would require an authorized lease prospectus in the event the respondent fails to include such information.

Submission by other than the owner or manager of a property must be accompanied by a letter from the ownership granting permission to make a general offering of space.  In instances where the Offeror is representing more than one property, the Offeror is hereby notified that they may only participate in negotiations on behalf of one owner.

AUTHORIZED CONTACTS:
In no event shall the Offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning the space to be leased with representatives of any Federal Agency other than the officers and employees of General Services Administration (GSA) or their authorized representative, Studley, Inc.

(CSI) of Jamestown, PA in accordance with (IAW) FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2), "Only One responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."   Under contract number M67854-06-C-1001, CSI manufactured twenty-five (25) NL/TLMS systems, munitions, and spares.

The NL/TLMS is a 40 mm, three bank launching system that fires 30 rounds of non-lethal primed munitions. The NL/TLMS will provide the Marine Expeditionary Forces the ability to deliver a high volume of non-lethal fire at designated ranges, both day and night, to enhance force protection at Vehicle Check Points (VCP) and during convoy security operations.

<DESC>The project is located within the Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge, which is adjacent to the City of Lawton, Oklahoma and the Fort Sill Army Base.  

This project consists of the placement of fills on both sides of an existing 2-mile asphalt paved road (Six Mile Scenic Road) to provide additional width, and the construction of paved shoulders along both sides of the road.  A double 10-foot by 5-foot concrete box culvert will be extended in place to match the new widths, along with the construction of new headwalls and wingwalls.  Other circular metal culverts along the route will need to be extended.  In order to perform the widening, both edges of the existing pavment must be saw cut along most of the length.  Also included in the project are the replacement of guardrails and guardrail end terminals, grouted riprap at the culvert extensions, and the replacement of permanent signs.  After the widening and paved shoulders are completed, the entire roadway surface will be treated with a 3/8-inch modified slurry seal.

In addition to the road work described above, a prefabricated single span steel pedestrian bridge, 140-feet in length, will be constructed at the Elk Mountain Campground area of the Refuge.  Other work associated with the bridge construction includes the removal of an existing small pedestrian bridge in the same area, the placement of loose Class 5 riprap at the new bridge abutments, and the use of concrete formliner, which will be painted, on the bridge abutments.  The deck of the new bridge will be poured and finished concrete.

Construction can be performed year-round.  The project is anticipated to begin in late summer 2009, and should take six months to complete.  The estimated price is between $1 and $2 million.

<DESC><p>Small Business Sources Sought Notice
<p>Development and Maintenance of a Multigenotypic Aged Mouse Colony<br />"This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."<br />Background<br />Current and projected experiments using rodents to model the aging processes and age-related diseases in humans require animals of defined genotype and controlled environmental and health status. Only with the meticulous, long-term control of genetic and environmental variables is it possible to maintain relevant animal models that may be used to study many of the biological and behavioral processes in aging. Therefore, a continuous supply of genetically defined, well characterized inbred and hybrid laboratory animals is essential for a program of research on aging. In 2004, NIA awarded a 9-year contract for the development and maintenance of a colony of genetically defined aged mice. The Statement of Work for that contract, HHSN260200400007C, stated that another 9-year contract for continuation of this project would be awarded at the start of the seventh year of that contract. This RFP is for development of that continuation contract.<br />Purpose and Objectives.<br />The objective is to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined laboratory mice for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony is to be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity.</p>
<p>Project requirements.<br />Specifically, the Contractor shall develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged mice of NIA-specified genotypes for use by investigators in studies of aging. The expected duration of this colony, and therefore of this contract, is nine years. During years 1 through 2, animals shall be entered into the colony, but few animals shall be removed from the colony except for the purposes of monitoring health and genetic purity. However, if the need should arise, animals may be distributed from the colony at anytime at the direction of the Project Officer. During years 3 through 7, animals shall continue to be entered into the colony and animals shall be distributed to investigators. This should be a period of stable operation with young animals entering the colony at approximately the same rate as older animals leave the colony due to distribution and normal attrition. The final two year period, years 8 and 9, will serve as the colony close-out period. Animals shall be maintained and disbursed, but entry of animals shall cease at the beginning of year 8 or when entries begin in a renewal contract colony. Thus the population in this contract colony will decline over the last two year period to a point of near zero or very few animals at the end of year nine.</p>
<p>The colony population at the end of each year of the nine year period should be approximately as follows:</p>
<p>YEAR 1 10,000 YEAR 4 72,000 YEAR 7 72,000<br />YEAR 2 48,000 YEAR 5 72,000 YEAR 8 40,000<br />YEAR 3 72,000 YEAR 6 72,000 YEAR 9 NEAR 0</p>
<p>The Contractor shall acquire foundation stock for four inbred strains of mice from a stock center identified by the Project Officer and shall re-derive the stock by caesarian section or embryo transfer under barrier conditions. After re-derivation, testing to confirm genetic purity and SPF health status shall be performed on the foundation colony, and breeding colonies will be established for the four inbred strains and two derivative hybrid strains. Mice will be entered into the aging colony at levels defined in the contract Statement of Work (SOW), currently a total of 4,150 mice per month (the hybrid strains account for approximately 5% of the total entry levels).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all production space needed for the colony, including at least two independent barriers to house the colony, with independent back-up and alarm systems. Since this is an aging colony, the contractor must be prepared to house the animals for up to 2-3 years. Mice shall be provided with sterilized food (formulation consistent with NIH31 open formula) and bedding, and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity range, light cycle, water treatment, etc.) as defined in the SOW. Mice shall be monitored weekly for signs of fighting or morbidity.</p>
<p>Semi-annual genetic monitoring of the breeding colonies and quarterly health monitoring of the aging colonies shall be performed and reported to the Project Officer as well as be included in the semi-annual progress reports. Genetic monitoring shall be accomplished by a panel of microsatellite markers that distinguish the inbred strains. Health monitoring shall include external exams for parasites, microbiology, serology, and histology.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ship the mice to investigators upon authorization from the Project Officer or her representative, providing secure shipping crates, food and water sources, and climate-controlled transport. The Contractor shall invoice customers for the cost of the animals (determined by the Project Officer) and all shipping costs, and apply the remittance to the cost of the contract. The Contractor shall account for all received funds on the monthly invoices. The Contractor shall weekly provide an inventory of the aging colony in a format approved by the Project Officer.<br />Anticipated period of performance.<br />The anticipated period of performance is a total of nine (9) years. The estimated month of award is May 2010.<br />Capability statement.<br />NIA is interested in soliciting capability statements from all qualified Offerors demonstrating their ability to perform this effort. At a minimum prospective Offerors must document capabilities in the following areas.<br />(a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; <br />(b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; <br />(c) prior completed projects of similar nature; <br />(d) corporate experience and management capability; and <br />(e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.<br />We ask that the capability statement use 12 font minimum, 8 &frac12; by 11 paper size, not exceed 20 single sided in length (including reference material). Electronic format can be Microsoft Word, Adobe PDF, or Microsoft Power Point including attachments, resumes, charts, etc. Organize material in such a manner that clearly identifies and address capability requirements and provide an executive summary.<br />Please provide your DUNS number, organization name, address, technical and administrative points of contact (including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses), and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code. Please identify your size classification relative to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541712 (Size Standard of 500) which is being contemplated for this requirement.<br />Include a statement whether or not you are a small business; HUBZone small business; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small business; women-owned small business; or small disadvantaged business in order to assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.<br />An electronic copy of the capability statement must be received at the following e-mail addresses no later than July 23, 2009. Telephone and facsimile responses will not be accepted.<br />Disclaimer and Important Notes. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response.

<DESC>This notice is issued by The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, located in Menlo Park, California. We are soliciting responses from interested parties to provide all personnel, materials, equipment, facilities and services required to complete engineering, design, documentation, fabrication, assembly, installation and acceptance testing of a double crystal offset monochromator for the X-ray Correlation Spectroscopy (XCS) Instrument. To be qualified, vendors must demonstrate past successful delivery of an x-ray monochromator. The XCS double crystal monochromator will be used to provide monochromatic photons to the XCS interaction point. The parallel offset of the monochromatic beam from the input beam is a fixed 600 mm. In order to deliver photon energies for 4 keV to 25 keV, the monochromator must be capable of switching between two pairs of crystals, Si (111) and Si (220). In addition, the first crystal must be capable of moving out of the path of the incoming beam, allowing the un-deflected white beam to propagate straight through the monochromator vacuum chamber to be used in other photon experiments. In order to minimize longitudinal beamline length, the both the upstream and downstream mirrors must move along the beam path for energy selection, the crossing point is then fixed. A pop-in x-ray position/intensity detector must be included at the crossing point to facilitate x-ray energy selection. The completed monochromator must include a vacuum enclosure capable of maintaining UHV and a stable alignment support. The nominal beam height is 1.4 m above a concrete floor. Vendors interested in performing this requirement are invited to provide the following information to SLAC Purchasing Office no later than 23 July 2009. The information may be submitted via email to the Contract Administrator at sherrie@SLAC.Stanford.EDU. Responses shall include the following information: Reference number XCSMONO-BIS-00001, Company name, DUNS Number, address, point of contact, phone number and email address; business size, disadvantage, 8(a), or HUBzone status; and , Evidence that the contractor has performed similar projects (past performance history). NO TELEPHONE OR WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATIONS OR POSTING STATUS. This posting is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as commitment by SLAC nor will SLAC pay for information solicited. No basis for claim against SLAC shall arise as a result from a response to the Sources Sought or SLAC use of any information provided. SLAC reserves the right to consider a small business, 8(a) or any other set aside arrangement as deemed appropriate for this procurement.

<DESC>A MARKET SURVEY is being conducted to determine if ther are adequate Small Business, HUBZone, 8(a), or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business contractors for the following proposed project: This project involves an Interim Removal Action (IRA) of Munitions and Explosives of Concern (MEC) and Munitions Debris (MD) at a Munitions Response Site (MRS) within the former Ravenna Army Ammunition Plant (RVAAP). Military munitions are the primary source of contamination.  Coincident environmental investigation and remediation may also be involved.  The approximate aerial extent of the MRS is five acres.  There are three 500-lb bombs known to be present at the site, as well as various other munitions and munitions debris, including 105mm projectiles and white phosphorus rifle grenades.  The three 500-lb bombs may be fused and contain high explosives.  The actual condition of the bombs will be determined prior to the start of this project.  Due to the various explosive hazards present at the site, there is an extremely high level of risk, and safety is a primary concern.  Contractors must demonstrate very strong qualifications and experience with all facets of the Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP) funded by the Army Environmental Command (AEC) and demonstrate an exceptional safety record.  The regulatory environment for this project is very demanding and stringent adherence to CERCLA requirements must be met.  The ability to develop extremely well written documents is also a requirement.  Substantial experience working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville District and the Ohio EPA and, specifically, working with munitions at RVAAP is preferred for this project because of the safety risks.  The contractor will be required to access information from a website for the Ravenna Environmental Information Management System (REIMS) to develop an acceptable proposal from a Phase I Time Critical Removal Action (TCRA) that is currently underway at the site.  The selected contractor will be required to prepare applicable Explosive Safety Submissions and Work Plans in a quality manner that will allow approval by the Army in a timely manner.  All remedial work on the project falls under the Ohio EPA Directors Final Findings and Orders (DFF&Os) specific to the Installation and all remedial work is subject to requirements of the Orders.  Experience executing work under the DFF&Os is preferred.<BR><BR>Contract duration is 730 days and estimated cost range is between $2,500,000 and $5,000,000.  NAICS is 562910.  Size limitation is 500 employees.  All interested Small Business, HUBZone, 8(a), or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business contractors should notify this office in writing by mail on or before 15 July 2009 by 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time.  Responses should include: (1) Identification or verification of the company by the Small Business Administration, as either a certified HUBZone, certified 8(a), or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business, or a Small Business, (2) The level of performance and payment bonding capacity that the company could attain for the proposed project, (3) Past Experience   Provide descriptions with your firms past experience on projects completed within the last five years which are similar to this project in size, scope, and dollar value.

Projects similar in size will include projects that meet the criteria in item a. above that are at least five acres in size. Projects of similar dollar value will include MMRP response sites that meet criteria a. and b. above and cost at least $3.5 million to remediate. Provide descriptions of projects substantially complete or completed within the last five years which are similar to this project in size, scope, and dollar value.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTERESTThe United States Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") under its Enhanced-Use Leasing (EUL) authority (38 U.S.C.  8161 - 8169), is seeking "expressions of interest" from bidders interested in a development opportunity to design, build, operate, and maintain 100 units of affordable housing with all units prioritized for Veterans. Fifty percent of the units must be prioritized for homeless Veterans. At least 50% of the units should be ADA accessible designated single level housing. This project must provide affordable housing with on-site social services at the Perry Point Veterans Medical Center (Perry Point VAMC). VA's goal is to create a safe and secure housing facility on the grounds of the Perry Point VAMC campus. This will be accomplished through a long-term out-lease of a currently underutilized 14 acre parcel of VA land located near the entrance of the VAMC campus. Based on Veteran demographics, 25% of the housing should be for families and 75% for single and/or spouse housing.Through this EUL authority, VA can offer a long-term use of assets (up to 75 years) in order to accommodate the scope of the project. In return for VA's outleasing of the property, the developer/lessee would be solely responsible for developing, financing, renovating, constructing, managing, maintaining, and operating the leased property as permanent supportive housing with a priority for homeless Veterans and Veterans at risk of becoming homeless. In return for the long-term use of the assets, the developer/operator will provide "fair consideration" to the Perry Point VAMC in the form of ground rent.The complete REI is posted on the PerryPoint RFP website, which can be accessed at the following location: http://www.va.gov/ASSETMANAGEMENT/docs/PerryPoint/PerryPointREI.pdf

This requirement is conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Commercial Items.

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. However, all responsible parties who identify their interest and capability to satisfy this requirement will be considered. No solicitation will be issued, therefore, all requests for the solicitation will be considered non-responsive.

<DESC>Under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c ) (1), the VA Medical Center, Dayton OH intends to issue a sole source award to Scriptpro USA Inc. to provide a Scriptpro SP 100 Robotic Proscription Dispensing System with Collating Control Center.  The contractor shall furnish all supplies, materials, and labor necessary to deliver the system and install it at the Dayton VA Medical Center's Clinical Based Outpatient Care Facility (CBOC) located in Springfield at 512 South Burnett Road, Springfield, OH 45505. A 12-month support service to maintain the system will also be required.  The price provided shall be inclusive of all delivery and installation charges.  The estimated amount of this award is $259,321.00.The Government has a need to maintain continuity and consistency in equipment and training between the various locations throughout VISN 10 in the State of Ohio.  It is anticipated that procurement of a separate system would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the government that is highly unlikely to be recoverable through competition.  Previous VA procurements have utilized this specific type of equipment, for which, there is only one known manufacturer and provider. As such the government plans to solicit and make an award for this requirement to only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1). A justification and approval is attached with this notice; signed copies are available upon request. This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Solicitation packages are not available.  Responses received in relation to this notice will be reviewed; however, ultimate determination regarding the removal of the sole source for this requirement rests with the contracting officer. Information regarding this notice maybe requested from the Contracting Officer, Alex Daniel, in writing to the VA Medical Center, VISN 10 Contracting Office (NBC), Attn: Alex Daniel, 4100 West Third Street, Dayton, OH 45428.  Information may also be faxed to 937-262-5974 or emailed to Alexander.Daniel@va.gov.

<DESC><p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract to Marine Sonic Technology, LTD, 5508 George Washington Memorial Hwy., PO Box 730, White Marsh, VA 23183 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source Available. The FBI requires a quantity of three (3) Sea Scan HDS Side Scan Sonar systems. Each system shall include HDS 900/1800kHz Towfish P/N SSS-7H046, ER 200 Winch P/N WS200M01, and Towfish Variable Angle Bracket P/N SSS-70000-01B, for 3 Underwater Search and Evidence Response Teams (USERT) to have identical technological equipment. The FBI currently owns a Marine Sonic "Easy Reel" winch; in order for the FBI to leverage this asset to the best of its ability, the FBI needs to acquire the HDS Side Scan Sonar system that is compatible with the existing inventory.
<p>Furthermore, the FBI requires the sonar system to have a minimum dual digital frequency of 900/1800 kHz as this higher frequency has enabled successful searches for small and large items searched by USERT. In addition to the above, the FBI USERT already owns a sizeable investment in Marine Sonic's Sea Scan PC sonar system and has spent a multitude of hours and funds gaining proficiency on these complex systems. Due to the collateral nature of the missions conducted by USERT, the teams must have at least a basic proficiency and the learning curve between the Marine Sonic PC and HDS systems is significantly lower than procuring from an entirely different manufacturer. Based on extensive market research conducted with knowledgeable individuals in Government and the related industry, only one responsible source can provide the requested items due to the fact that Marine Sonic Technology, LTD is the sole manufacturer and sole distributor to the Federal Government for the Marine Sonic Sea Scan HDS Side Scan Sonar system.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit quotes to this office by 10:00 AM, EST, Friday, July 15, 2009, via e-mail to Dina.Olibah@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This contract will be awarded as a commercial item in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Parts 12 and 13. All contractors anticipating award, must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database.</p>

The combination of the element and the physical package provide an extremely low response time. These temperature sensors, when packaged in sets of three, must maintain an accuracy of &plusmn; 0.3&ordm;C in all conditions from -60.0&deg;C to 60.0&ordm;C. The environmentally stable cable provided is 15 feet long, four 22 awg conductors with shield and drain. The temperature sensors must be lot stamped and manufactured to the International Temperature Scale ITS-1990 and traceable to NIST through primary and secondary calibration standards. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by closing date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>THIS IS AN TIME AND DATE EXTENSION TO INL-CJPS

The deadline is July 17, 2009. 

THE REQUIREMENT HAS NOT CHANGED

This is a request for market research only. The government does not intend to award a contract as a result of this announcement. 

The U.S. Department of State (DoS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) has as one of its responsibilities the provision of a wide array of support to criminal justice sector development programs worldwide. Program countries/areas include Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Liberia, Lebanon, Haiti, the West Bank, and Kosovo. INL currently has three indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) CIVPOL contracts under which task orders are competed for individual programs as requirements are identified. The contracts provide criminal justice advisors, security personnel, life support, office and living facilities, vehicles, and associated equipment and supplies. 

The current contracts expire soon and INL intends to award up to five successor IDIQ contracts titled Criminal Justice Program Support (CJPS) that are of much the same nature in order to continue to provide this support. It is expected that criminal justice support programs in Iraq and Afghanistan will be provided under other, separately awarded contracts. It is possible that support to relatively small programs in those countries could be provided under the CJPS contracts.

This Request for Information (RFI) describes the Government’s approach for a follow-on acquisition, CJPS, which builds on the CIVPOL program and expands the opportunities for wider industry participation. The Government also expresses its interest in the participation in the solicitation process, either directly or as subcontractors, of smaller organizations with specialized capabilities and experience in various criminal justice disciplines.

The purpose of this RFI is twofold:

• Provide information to industry explaining the Government’s CJPS acquisition approach.

• Solicit comments from industry which address:

• Acquisition approach

• Extent to which industry can meet the Government’s requirements.

• Contracting approach

• Staffing

• Field support

• Pricing structure 

• Program management

• Transition requirements

Where responders differ with the Government’s current approach as presented in this RFI, we specifically request suggested alternatives that would be equally effective in meeting the Government’s objectives.

This RFI is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government's use of such information.

Respondents are encouraged to be as specific as possible in addressing any and all sections of the RFI and to provide suggestions for alternative approaches and solutions. Feedback of a general or non-specific nature is less useful and will have limited utility in refining the acquisition strategy and impacting the content of the RFP.

Interested parties may respond to this RFI in accordance with the instructions provided in Table 6-1 of the attachment.

All vendors who responded to the RFI were asked to voluntarily demonstrate their products or solutions.

LAW GOVERNING CONTRACTS (JAN 2005) - In any dispute arising out of this contract, the decision of which requires consideration of law questions, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be interpreted and determined in accordance with the substantive laws of the United States of America.</p>
<p>4. LEGAL STATUS (JAN 2005) - The NAFI is an integral part of the Department of Defense and is an instrumentality of the United States Government. Therefore, NAFI contracts are United States Government contracts; however, they do not obligate appropriated funds of the United States.</p>

<p>b. In the event this contract is terminated as provided in paragraph "a" hereof, the NAFI shall be entitled (i) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of contract by the Contractor, and (ii) as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to exemplary damages in an amount (as determined by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the cost incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee.</p>
<p>c. The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (JAN 2005) - The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI.

<p>9. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (JAN 2005) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.</p>
<p>10. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (JAN 2005)<br />a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-</p>
<p>(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension;<br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2)below);or<br />(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below).</p>
<p>(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.</p>
<p>b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.</p>
<p>c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.</p>
<p>d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any</p>
<p>(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.</p>
<p>e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted.

<p>a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers.

As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices.<br />b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified<br />payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day.</p>
<p>22. INVOICES (JAN 2005):</p>
<p>a. An invoice is a written request for payment under the contract for supplies delivered or for services rendered.

Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate (one copy shall be marked "Original") unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97-177):<br />(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred.<br />(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated.<br />(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates.<br />(iv) The following periods of time will not be included:</p>

<p>25. NON WAIVER OF DEFAULTS (JAN 2005) - Any failure by the NAFI at any time, or from time to time, to enforce or require strict performance of any terms or conditions of this contract will not constitute waiver thereof and will not affect or impair such terms or conditions in any way or the NAFI's right at any time to avail itself of such remedies as it may have for any breach or breaches of such terms and conditions.</p>

<p>1. Background and Need -</p>
<p>The CDC, Office on Smoking and Health, is preparing for the release of the 2009 Surgeon General's Report (SGR) on tobacco. In support of this release, our office has a need to engage the services of a digital marketing company with experience in healthcare and consumer digital social media marketing. This proposed acquisition is being pursued in order to reach modern audiences that prefer to receive news, health and other information through internet sites such as Face Book, Twitter, and MySpace through multiple devices including mobile phones. Tailoring messages for these internet and mobile sites requires specialized knowledge of the audiences which frequent them. As fewer and fewer people access newspapers, network television and traditional internet sites for information, employing a digital multi-site approach increases the reach of communications efforts.</p>

The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1).

If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below.

REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE – All items with 21 days after date of contract award.

The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails.

(b) The permissible variation shall be limited to:

10 Percent increase

For all shipments of packaged materiel to the government,
which includes either Depot (DLA-Direct) or DVD (Customer-
Direct) shipments, both DoD linear and two-dimensional (2D)
bar code markings are required on Military Shipping Labels
in accordance with MIL-STD-129, Revision P, dated December
15, 2002 (but see DLAD 52.211-9010(D) for exceptions to the
requirement for MSL and 2D symbols).  See the DLA packaging
web site identified in DLAD 52.211-9010(E) for change
notices to MIL-STD-129P that apply.  2D bar coding shall be
in accordance with ISO/IEC 15438, ISO/IEC 15434 (ANSI MH10.8.3)
and DoD 4500.9-R.  MSL linear (code 3 of 9 or code 39) bar
coding shall be in accordance with ISO/IEC 16388.  Shipping
label stock quality shall meet MIL-PRF-61002.  Bar code print
quality shall meet ANSI MH10.8-2000 or ANSI X3.182-1990 (R2000)
for applicable 2D and/or linear bar codes.  All DVD shipments
shall meet additional linear bar coding requirements in DLAD
52.211-9010(C).  Except for the Transportation Control Number
(TCN), which must always be present on the Military Shipping
Label, when the contract/order omits any other data elements as
defined in MIL-STD-129P and if the information is not available
from the Administrative Contracting Office, then the field is
not required as part of the Military Shipping Label and may be
left blank.  If there are inconsistencies between the schedule
and MIL-STD-129P, the schedule takes precedence.

<SUBJECT>Evacuation Chairs
<SOLNBR>1060562
<RESPDATE>071309
<CONTACT>Michelle Street, Contract Specialist, Phone 3018277155, Email Michelle.Street@fda.hhs.gov - Gina Jackson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-827-7181, Email gina.jackson@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>EMERGENCY EVACUATION CHAIRS
The Safety Management Team (SMT) is responsible for planning and managing emergency evacuations from CFSAN facilities. In the course of training lay staff responders in the operation of evacuation chairs last year, SMT Life Safety staff identified 5 critical problems. 

First, it learned that its existing equipment could not be reliably operated in its stairwells that have smaller intermediate landings, as there was insufficient room for turning the apparatus and person without lifting. In order to accommodate both staff and visitors, SMT needs to have evacuation equipment that can transport a person weighing up to 400 lbs. Lay staff responders cannot be expected to lift loaded emergency evacuation chairs in order to negotiate small-area landings.

Second, a problem was identified due to the multiple types of evacuation chairs currently in use in CFSAN metropolitan Washington area facilities. Many staff responders move freely between buildings with differing equipment, making it difficult for them to participate in whatever building they are in at the time of evacuation if they are unfamiliar with that building’s evacuation chairs. Complexity is also introduced into initial and refresher training efforts due to the existing multiple chair types.

Third, some CFSAN egress paths require upward-, rather than traditional downward-, directed operation of evacuation chairs. This is the case for the Wiley building basement, which has no basement-level exit to the outside, but which houses offices, labs, training suites, and an auditorium. Evacuation chairs must be specially designed for two-person fore and aft operation, i.e., be equipped with locking foot end grab handles, in order to ascend stairs without risking the chair overturning or injury to the responders.

Fourth, chairs which require the person being transported to recline during transport are more difficult to load, by lay responders, than are those designed for loading by the individual simply sitting down.

Fifth, heavier chair designs make it more difficult for lay responders to redeploy a chair back up steps to transport additional persons.  The SMT proposes to replace existing evacuation chairs in all of its metropolitan Washington area facilities with a single model that successfully addresses all the incompatibilities or shortcomings noted above.

Specifications for evacuation chair:
To successfully address the incompatibilities and shortcomings noted above, replacement evacuation chairs will need to meet the following requirements:

1. Must have locking foot end lift handle to permit two-person chair lift (some CFSAN facilities have evacuation egress paths from basement occupancies that require ascending steps in stairwell; this requires a 2-person lift)

2. Design must permit navigation by lay responders in stairwells with small landing areas (several CFSAN stairwells have intermediate landings that are too small for operation of reclining-style evacuation chairs by lay responders)

3. Design must permit user to enter chair by sitting down

4. Chair must be light enough (not more than 40 lbs.) to be carried back up steps by lay responders in order to assist additional persons

5. At least 400 lb. weight capacity

Interested sources shall submit all price, descriptive literature and technical proposals, to Michelle Street, (Contract Specialist), email: Michelle.Street@fda.hhs.gov, or alternate Gina Jackson (Contracting Officer), email: Gina.Jackson@fda.hhs.gov. Please indicate the solicitation number on the outside of your package. Any incomplete responses or responses received after the closing will not be accepted. Faxed copies of proposal package will not be accepted. The coversheet to the proposal shall have the offeror’s information. The price and technical proposal shall only have the solicitation number. The offeror’s information SHALL NOT appear anywhere on or in the price or technical proposal. Closing date for receipt of proposals is July 13, 2009 at 2:00P.M. EST. 

DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION MUST BE INCLUDED IN PRICE!

<p><br />1.0 DESCRIPTION OF EFFORT:</p>
<p>This is contemplated as a Firm Fixed Price IDIQ contract with a Base Order and Three (3) separate optional Task Orders.</p>
<p>The requirement is for the following commercial services:</p>
<p>Contract Base: Phase One:</p>
<p>Achieves deployment for SNP and includes 5 Quality Assurance sessions at 16 days each, 3 Build Iterations and 1 UAT at 26 days each. It also includes development of web-based training as well as 2 traditional training sessions and 1 month of help-desk support. The contractor will deliver a Project Plan identifying the schedule upon initiation of the Phase.</p>
<p>Optional Task 1: SNAP Deployment</p>
<p>Development Phase Two: Deploy for SNAP and includes 5 Requirements Gathering Sessions at 17 days each, 5 QA Sessions at 16 days each, 2 Build Iterations and 1 UAT at 26 Days each. It also includes 2 traditional training sessions and 1 month of help-desk support. The contractor will deliver a Project Plan identifying the schedule upon initiation of the Phase.</p>
<p>Optional Task 2: Remaining Office Deployment.</p>
<p>Development Phase 3: Deploy to remaining offices in FNS and the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. This phase includes 5 Requirements Gathering Sessions at 17 days each, 5 QA Sessions at 16 days each, 1 Build Iteration and 1 UAT at 26 Days each. It also includes 2 traditional training sessions and 1 month of help-desk support. The contractor will deliver a Project Plan identifying the schedule upon initiation of the Phase.</p>
<p>Optional Task 3: Technical Assistance:</p>
<p>Outside of the month-long help-desk support term FNS will be maintaining the application.

The contractor will identify approaches that have been or are likely to be successful for addressing issues. The contractor will work to help the FNS team better understand and diagnose problems. The contractor will offer constructive criticism and recommend or provide additional instruction or training on the intricacies of the platform so that the government will be able to maintain this application internally.</p>

<p>3.2 Non-critical Technical Evaluation Elements<br />&bull; Completeness of the Plan and Approach : 60%<br />&bull; Likelihood of Success: 40%</p>
<p>&bull; Completeness of Plan and Approach - 60%<br />The Offeror shall demonstrate an understanding of the requirements of the project by submitting a well described plan of how they intend to meet the requirements as described in Sections 5 and 6 of the Statement of Work. Evaluation of this element will be concerned with the approach for turning an already mature requirement into an application given the project management constraints of schedule, quality, scope, risk, and customer satisfaction. Proposals will be evaluated to produce the highest aggregate value in these areas.</p>
<p>&bull; Likelihood of Success - 40%<br />The Evaluation Panel will evaluate technical volumes to mitigate risks posed from the offerors. As such the Technical Evaluation Panel will consider two primary areas to mitigate risk. The first area of evaluation is in the form of relevant past performance from the Offeror. This will be evaluated by an examination of the past performance from previous projects that are of a consistent size AND scope to the work identified in this Statement of Work. The second area is in the form of the experience of personnel identified as "Key" in the Proposal. The Technical Evaluation Panel will review the experience of the "Key" personnel to identify work that they have performed that is consistent, in terms of both scope AND magnitude, with the work identified in this Statement of Work.</p>
<p>4.0 Debriefings</p>
<p>Unsuccessful firms will be notified and will have the opportunity to request a debriefing according to the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p>5.0 Other Information</p>
<p>If you have any questions please contact Contract Specialist Jason Kattman at (703) 305-2250. Technical questions regarding the specifications may be provided to jason.kattman@fns.usda.gov until July 24th at 5:00 pm.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, TIRNO-09-Q-00A15, provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-34 are incorporated into this RFQ.  This procurement is a set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned companies.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 423430. The small business size standard is $100 million. 

See the attached Government Equipment List (GEL) for the contract line item (CLIN) specifications.  All pricing must be submitted on the attached GEL and must include the commercial list price and percent discount offered to the IRS.  Pricing submitted in any other format will not be accepted.

The IRS is seeking competitive quotes for the following brand name requirement, “EMC Hardware and Software Maintenance."  The rationale supporting this brand name requirement is that the storage standard for all IRS Tier 2 applications and databases is EMC Direct Access Systems Disk (DASD).  If there is a problem with the DASD or if software is not covered under maintenance, Production/Modernization could experience an extended shut-down until the required maintenance is purchased.

This is a Request For Quote (RFQ) and brand name justification to procure EMC Hardware and Software Maintenance.  The IRS is not requesting information from resellers of other brand names but manufacturers that can perform the brand name equivalent.  All manufacturers that can perform the equivalent function/services should submit their technical qualifications and literature to the following email address: Michael.A.Crawford@irs.gov.  

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-34 are applicable to this procurement: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to offerors – Commercial Items, and FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition.

All responsible sources that can provide the above requirements shall submit written quotations no later than 3:00pm EST on July 15, 2009. The government intends to award a firm fixed price order. The Vendor shall be selected based on the lowest priced technically acceptable offer.  All quotes must include price(s); Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted. All questions must be submitted by 3:00pm EST on July 14, 2009 by email to Michael.A.Crawford@irs.gov.

To be considered responsive and technically acceptable, vendors must submit proposals that are structured in accordance with the instructions set forth in this solicitation and fully address the entire requirement.  You will be considered non-responsive and technically unacceptable if your quote does not fully address the entire requirement.  This will also render your pricing unacceptable.  Quotes shall include price information, quote expiration date, DUNS, Cage Code, tax ID and terms and conditions.

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has a requirement for brand name software maintenance agreements as outlined above. All of the products referenced in this posting are proprietary products of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).

The GeoRover software suite is the only software that fulfills the form, fit, and function requirements of the NGA at this time. Vendors that respond to this solicitation must be authorized resellers of SAIC. Vendor shall quote all or none of the listed items.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number DTNH22-09-Q-00071 applies and is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33.   Competition for this requirement is “full and open.”  The NAICS Code is 541380.  
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC) has a requirement for a quantity of (1) Ejection Mitigation Impactor Assembly which includes a propulsion system.   This system shall be used to conduct tests on light passenger vehicles to assess the side window ejection mitigation performance of those vehicles.  The impactor consists of a moving impactor mechanism, bearings, and bearing housing structure.  The moving impactor mechanism includes a headform mounted on one end.  
The following are the minimum specifications of the Ejection Mitigation Impactor:  
a.	The moving impactor mechanism must have a mass of 18 kg (±0.2 kg). Also indicate whether the moving impactor mechanism can be weighted to 26 kg.
b.	The headform must conform to the specifications contained in drawing numbers ATD-7304, ATD-7305, and ATD-7306 (see DRAWING #1).
c.	When mounted for testing with an appropriate support frame, the moving impactor mechanism must be capable of being positioned to strike targets in the side window areas on production vehicles, where the impact direction is interior to exterior and lateral to the vehicle.  To achieve these impact locations, the vehicle must not be permanently damaged.  Opposite side doors and windows, as well as removable interior components (e.g. seats, center console, steering wheel), may be removed.  The required targets are illustrated in DRAWING # 2.
d.	The ejection mitigation impactor must have sufficient available stroke to allow the moving impactor mechanism to extend at least 150 millimeters beyond the plane of the vehicle side window, when tested through deployed air curtains of current production vehicles.
e.	The ejection mitigation impactor must be capable of measuring the displacement of the moving impactor mechanism throughout the entire stroke, with an accuracy of ± 2 millimeters.
f.	The maximum radial deflection of the ejection mitigation impactor must not exceed 10 millimeters.  ATTACHMENT #1 contains the procedures for determining the maximum radial deflection.
g.	The maximum dynamic coefficient of friction of the ejection mitigation impactor must not exceed 0.25.  ATTACHMENT #1 contains the procedures for determining the maximum dynamic coefficient of friction.
h.	The moving impactor mechanism must be designed for use at peak velocities between 15 km/h and 25 km/h, with a tolerance within the range of ± 0.25 km/h (±0.15 km/h or less is preferred).
i.	When used with an appropriate propulsion system, the time from the signal to deploy the air curtain to the peak velocity of the moving impactor mechanism must not exceed 100 milliseconds for any velocity within the range of 15 km/h to 25 km/h.  These velocities must also be achieved prior to the impactor making contact with deployed air curtains of current production vehicles and with sufficient remaining impactor stroke to achieve the specification in d.   NOTE: Adherence to the radial deflection and coefficient of friction requirements is not required when the moving impactor mass is weighted to 26 kg, but it is preferred
j.	The impactor must have the built-in capability to stop the 18 kg moving impactor mechanism if no target is impacted, from a velocity of 25 km/h and without damage to the impactor, propulsion system, or support frame.  Damage to an inexpensive, easily replaceable, energy-absorbing element specifically designed for this purpose is permissible.
The following are the minimum specifications of the Propulsion System:
a.	The propulsion system must be designed to operate in conjunction with the ejection mitigation impactor.
b.	The propulsion system must have the capacity to accelerate a mass of 18 kg to peak velocities between 15 km/h and 25 km/h with a tolerance within the range of ±0.25 km/h (± 0.15 km/h or less is preferred). If the moving impactor mechanism can be weighted to 26 kg, indicate if the propulsion system has the capacity to accelerate that mass to peak velocities between 15 km/h and 22 km/h.
c.	The time from the signal to deploy the air curtain to the peak velocity of the moving impactor mechanism must not exceed 100 milliseconds for any velocity within the range of 15 km/h to 25 km/h.  These velocities must also be achieved prior to the impactor making contact with deployed air curtains of current production vehicles and with sufficient remaining impactor stroke to achieve the Ejection Mitigation Impactor specification “d”.
d.	The control system must have the capability for the operator to control the energizing of the propulsion system to achieve pre-determined impacts velocities within the range and tolerance described in b.
e.	The control system must have the capability to send signals to deploy an air curtain, fire the impactor, and activate a data acquisition system, in the proper sequence, with one action by the operator (e.g. pushing one button). Indicate if the system is capable of sending signals, in the proper sequence to activate other equipment.
f.	The control system must have the capability to fire the impactor at a pre-determined delay time after the air curtain is deployed.  The capability to set delay times within the range of 0 seconds to 7 seconds in 100 ms increments is required, but the capability for setting a longer delay time is preferred. 
The Government may consider the following optional equipment to facilitate use of this impactor:  
1.	A support frame with the following minimum requirements: 
a.	Be designed to work in conjunction with the proposed ejection mitigation impactor with propulsion system.
b.	When used with the ejection mitigation impactor, the frame must allow the moving impactor mechanism to be positioned to strike targets in the side window areas on production vehicles, where the impact direction is interior to exterior and lateral to the vehicle.  To achieve these impact locations, the vehicle must not be permanently damaged.  Opposite side doors and windows, as well as removable interior components (e.g. seats, center console, steering wheel), may be removed.  The required targets are illustrated in DRAWING #2.
c.	The support frame must provide adjustment of the ejection mitigation impactor in the vertical direction, to allow for targeting.  The required minimum range of adjustment is 1.2 to 1.9 meters from the center of the headform to the floor, and the minimum increment for this adjustment is 3 millimeters.  If the requirements for adjustment range and/or increment cannot be met, please provide what adjustment range is possible. 
d.	The support frame must provide adjustment of the ejection mitigation impactor in the vehicle lateral direction (i.e. in the direction of moving impactor mechanism motion), to allow for final positioning of the headform.  The required minimum adjustment is 150 millimeters, and the minimum increment for this adjustment is 5 millimeters.  If the minimum requirements for adjustment range and/or increment cannot be met, provide proposed system capabilities.
e.	When the ejection mitigation impactor assembly is used in conjunction with the the support frame, it must have a vertical radial deflection of no more than 15 millimeters (i.e. +Z direction in Attachment #1).
f.	When the headform is fired at 24 km/h, point P must remain within cylinder C from the position at which the moving impactor mechanism achieves peak velocity to the position 100 millimeters beyond the position of peak velocity.  (Note:  Point P is the geometric center of the headform on the outer surface of the headform, and cylinder C is a 20-millimeter diameter cylinder, centered on point P and parallel to the headform’s direction of motion). This requirement is illustrated in DRAWING #2.  If the 20-millimeter requirement cannot be met, please provide the performance information for the proposed assembly.
2.	Data Acquisition System (DAS) - DAS is not required as part of the ejection impactor with propulsion system base purchase.  If the option of a DAS is proposed, include the performance specifications of the DAS.
3.	Energy Source – An energy source is not required as part of the ejection impactor with propulsion system base purchase (e.g. pressurized gas, hydraulic pump, etc.).  If, however, the energy source required for use with the proposed propulsion system is other than standard compressed gas cylinders, provide a description of the energy source needed.  If the option of an energy source is proposed, include the performance specifications of the energy system.
4.	Additional Instrumentation, Components or Capabilities– Additional components may be proposed.  For each optional component proposed, include detailed description and capabilities.
5.	Installation and/or Training – If specific contractor provided installation or training is proposed as an option, include detailed description and schedule.

Background:  The NIST Center for Neutron Research does basic materials research that is useful for many basic and applied science disciplines including biology, chemistry, condensed matter physics, polymer research, etc. The purpose of this procurement is to increase the number of temperature baths used for sample temperature control on multiple neutron scattering instruments. These temperature baths are all the same so that they may be interchanged as necessary and so that their controls are familiar for the group of scientists employing them. The objective of this procurement is to purchase a Julabo LH-41 temperature control bath, along with providing options for the future purchase of this same item.
Brand Name Only Justification: The Julabo model LH-45 is discontinued and model LH-41 takes its place with the same specifications as a drop-in replacement, including the software control.  Julabo LH-41 Temperature Bath has proven to be very reliable, capable, and fast. The reasons that we wish to purchase this Brand Name Only item are:  1) to maintain a consistent equipment interface for local and guest researchers; 2) to serve as a drop-in replacement spare; and 3) to prevent duplication of effort that would be required to integrate a new system.

The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) presently has three Julabo LH45 ultra-low refrigerated circulators that have a working temperature range from -40 to 250 C. These are all used on neutron scattering instruments for control of the sample environment. The NCNR is a user facility serving approximately 1000 unique guest researchers per year, putting a great emphasis on the reliability, uptime and standardization of our equipment.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-34.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325510 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside.  In accordance with the Non-Manufacturer Rule, to qualify under a small business set-aside, the distributor and the manufacturer must qualify as a Small Business under the NAICS code identified above. ***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase Lead-containing Coatings on Flexible Substrates for Reference Material Development. ***

Background:

NIST Analytical Chemistry Division is developing new reference materials to enable validation of  the accuracy of test results for lead (Pb) in paints and other coatings on children’s products pursuant to the requirements of the Consumer Products Safety Improvement Act of 2008.  The new reference materials are intended specifically for use with X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry.  The technical requirements of the measurement process for Pb in paint using XRF are such that the forms and compositions of the coatings and the substrates comprising the proposed new reference materials must be similar to those frequently encountered with toys.  An effective experimental design for validation of an XRF method for thin films would ideally have a number of materials (a minimum of 3 has been recommended by experts) having films of different thicknesses and different Pb concentrations. 

General Information:

NIST is seeking to have a contractor produce the materials in finished form.  That process is expected to include procurement of paint (or similar material) and a flexible plastic substrate material, spiking of the required concentration of lead (Pb) into the liquid form paint, application of uniform coatings onto the flexible substrate, curing of the paint, testing several characteristics of the finished coating, and delivery to NIST.

An example of the materials being sought is NIST Standard Reference Material 2579a, a set of six sheets of polyester each coated with a uniform paint film containing Pb.  The six Pb concentrations were tinted different colors with the SRM number printed in a corner.  The set includes a blank with clear lacquer used in place of paint.  SRM 2579a was created for use in building inspections and remediation of lead paint.  The concentrations are at least two orders of magnitude higher than required at this time.  Documentation on SRM 2579a may found at https://srmors.nist.gov/tables/view_table.cfm?table=105-13.htm/.  Click the small, blue C icons to view the certificates of analysis for SRMs 2570 through 2579a. 

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

 Line Item 0001: Lead-containing Coatings on Flexible Substrates for Reference Material Development, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:

1.	Production Size and Unit Dimensions:
The requirement is to produce three different materials.  Each one shall consist of a coating film on a polymer substrate.  The production run of each material shall consist of at least 1500 samples.  Each material shall have one of three Pb concentrations and one of two coating thicknesses applied.  The final form of individual samples shall be rectangular with dimensions in the range of 3.5 cm (1.4”) or greater on each side up to 8 cm x 13 cm (3” x 5”).  The coated area must be large enough for measurement of a circular area of 2.5 cm2 or greater at four or more distinct, non-overlapping locations on each piece.  Once the dimensions have been determined by the Contractor and approved by NIST, all subsequent pieces shall be of the same dimensions with tolerances of + 0.2 cm/- 0.2 cm.

2.	Pb Concentration:
The coating must contain lead (Pb) at concentrations up to 300 mg/kg in the dried or cured coating film.  The coating must be a reasonable simulant or an example of the types of paints, thermoplastics, lacquers and other coatings commonly used on toys and other children’s products.  In the coating layer, the Pb concentration must be uniform across each piece and across the entire production run.  Ideal location-to-location variability shall be less than 10 % relative standard deviation.  Target Pb concentrations are 90 mg/kg, and 300 mg/kg with a tolerance of +/- 10 mg/kg.  A third coating, known as the blank, shall not contain detectable Pb, preferably < 3 mg/kg.  Note:  Coating technology must have Pb incorporated as an organometallic compound at the molecular level.  Evaporated metal coatings do not qualify.

3.	Coating Thickness:
Coating films must have one of two different thicknesses after curing among the three films:  10 &#61549;m to 20 &#61549;m (0.4 mils to 0.8 mils) and 40 &#61549;m to 50 &#61549;m (1.6 mils to 2.0 mils).  The uniformity of each thickness should be controlled to within a range of 10 % relative to the nominal thickness across the surface of each piece and across the production run for each combination of Pb concentration and layer thickness.  

4.	Substrate Requirements:
The substrate shall be a relatively thin polymer sheet with surface roughness similar to the expected uniformity of the coating thickness.  The polymer must not contain detectable Pb, preferably less than 3 mg/kg.  The coating must adhere strongly to the sheet under flexure.  The finished product shall be flexible enough to conform to the surface of a cylinder 3 cm diameter without damage.  Polyester has been used successfully in a past project.

5.	 Testing
NIST shall specify which pieces are to be retained and tested by the contractor or the contractor’s representative.  

6.	Packaging (optional):
These materials shall be sold in sets having one piece of each composition in a container that protects the coating surfaces from abrasion when not in use.  All else being equal, proposals incorporating a packaging system for individual pieces shall receive additional consideration.

Pricing for packaging, if offered, shall be indicated separately on the quotation.

Delivery Requirements:

The required materials are to be delivered in three phases:
  
Phase 1 – Contractor to provide at least 30 prototype units of each composition to NIST for technical evaluation within 60 days of receipt of order.

Phase 2 – Contractor to provide final delivery of all productions units, less test samples specified by NIST, of all three compositions within 90 days of government approval.

Phase 3 – Contractor to provide a written report that includes quality assurance samples, a description of the method (or a reference to an industry standard test method), and a description of the equipment used.  Completed reports of analysis for determinations of coating thickness, and mass density submitted within 30 days after delivery of production units.

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. 

Evaluation Criteria:

Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government.  The Technical Acceptability factor is a go/no-go factor.  Offerors who meet this factor will then be evaluated for past performance. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Acceptability factor "Meeting the Minimum Specifications," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.  

Technical capability and past performance, when combined, shall be approximately equal in importance to price. If Technical Capability and Past Performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.

Technical Capability:

Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include the manufacturer or brand name, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which addresses all salient characteristics, and clearly documents that the offered product meets salient characteristics stated above.

The sole source determination is based on several factors, as there are advantages with continuing with the present system.  First, the Viasys is already integrated with CRIS, the NIH CRC medical record system.  It took a great deal of time and effort, from multiple parties, to create a functional interface.  Bringing on a new system could lead to substantial delays in data transmission via a new CRIS interface.  In addition, it would likely lead to increased costs and staff time.  Second, the pulmonary function laboratory staff is familiar with the Viasys equipment line and is able to troubleshoot problems.  Third, it may cost more in service contract fees to purchase a different system.  In order to continue uninterrupted service, the laboratory staff is required to maintain at least three (3) up-to-date PFT operating systems.

Market research was conducted by the Government has determined that there were no small businesses available to supply the requested instrument.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with  FAR Part 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This  solicitation,  RFQ1110050,  provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-33 are incorporated into this Request for Quotation (RFQ). Delivery and acceptance will be performed in Bethesda, Maryland.

The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) on behalf of  National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) seeks to purchase  one (1) Leica TCS SP5  Spectral Confocal Imaging System. The salient characteristics of the LEICA TCS SP5 Spectral Confocal Imaging system are as follows:

1.Upright fixed-stage microscope and components: 
 
a.Must be an upright fixed-stage microscope with full automation of all functions to facilitate hands-free use under all imaging modes;
b.Must be controllable via a fully programmable remote touch screen device;
c.Must be equipped with Dodt Gradient Contrast optics for deep tissue imaging in infrared (IR) transmitted light, with the ability to do simultaneous IR 2 Photo fluroescense and IR scanning gradient contrast (IR-SGC). 
d.Must be equipped with 2 exchangeable nosepieces, 6 position motorized and encoded for conventional dry and water immersion objectives, and fixed nosepiece for the Super Objective. Microscope must auto-detect nosepiece when exchanged and configure Confocal pinhole automatically.

2.Optical Detection System:
a.Must be a PRISM Based Spectrophotometer for maximum sensitivity (prism has 98% transmission vs. approximately 50% for a diffraction grating).  This facilitates long term cell imaging experiments with the lowest possible laser power for cell viability.  Also, high efficiency facilitates the use of internal Spectral Detectors for 2 Photon excited samples.
b.Must allow for up to 5 independent and simultaneous spectral detectors continuously turnable in spectral windo width and position. This facilitates simultaneous acquisition of multiple fluroophores without spectral bleed through and spectral crosstalk. Spectral windows must be able to acquire emission with 1nm step.
c.Must maintain constant image intensity regardless of scanning speed and format without adjusting photomultiplier tube (PMT) gain laser power.
3.Laser Scanning System:
a.Must be a true Point Scanning system with a field of view index of 22mm and formats from 16 x 16 to 8,192x 8,192 pixels.  System must include dual Tandem scan mirror assemblies for both Conventional Scan (continually tunable scanning speeds from 1Hz to 2800Hz) and Resonant Scanning (8,000 and 16,000Hz).  The Tandem Scanner allows image acquisition rates of between<1 frame per second and more than 300 frames per second. Dual scanners must reside in the same scan head and be software switchable without any need for re-alignment. Both scanners must work in both Confocal and 2 Photon imaging mmodes. 
b.Must facilitate Scan Field Rotation of of at least 200 degrees without changing the deflection angle of scan mirrors to ensure maximum scan linearity and speed stability.

4.Laser Selection:
a.Scan Head must allow for Dual UV, Visible and Dual IR 2 Photon lasers to be completed simultaneously.
b.Visible laser port must accommodate up to 5 visible wavelength laser (up to 8 lines) via a fiber optic coupling. 
c.System must have the option to be upgraded with the patented Leica AOBS Acousto Optical Beam Splitter, which replaces the primary Dichroic Beam Splitter with an acoustically turnable device that deflects up to 8 laser lines simultaneously into the excitation beam path, and allows 95% of all emitted wavelengths to pass to the spectral detectors.
d.Two Photon System must include  Non-DescannedDetectors (NDD) that are software selectable by the imaging software included with the confocal system.
e.Tunable Spectral Detectors for MP must be sensitive enough (prism based) to be used for detection of 2 Photon excited samples.  This spectral tuning also facilitates the use of these PMTs for detection of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) signals regardless of excitation wavelength.

5.General System:
a.must offer high-throughput fiber optic Broadband communication between the scan head and data acquisition computer.
b.must have the option to be configured with a Galvo-Z-stage for rapid and precise real-time XZ sectioning.
c.must be controlled via both software and the “Digital Dashboard” control panel with 6 freely difinable rotary knobs with LcD status display.
d.must be upgradeable to the following techniques and applications:
1)WLL – White Light Laser
2)FLIM – Fluorscence Lifttime Imaging
3)FCS – Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy
4)Matrix Scanning –High Content XYZT Scanning with Networked High Speed Data Transfer to Remote Storage Drives such as RAID.

<DESC><p>This synopsis is for the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) requirement.&nbsp; This synopsis is prepared in accordance with FAR Sub-parts 5.2 and 6.3.&nbsp; The synopsis serves to give notice of the Government's intent to negotiate and issue a sole source bridge contact in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and Federal Acquisitions Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements."&nbsp; This bridge contract is necessary to provide a continuation of critical services until the re-competition of the NANPA requirement is completed.&nbsp; NANPA holds overall responsibility for the neutral administration of NANPA numbering resources, subject to directives from regulatory authorities in the countries that share the NANPA.&nbsp; NANPA's role in the U.S. includes the following: overall NANPA administration, Central Office (CO) Code Administration; Numbering Plan Area (NPA) relief planning: collection, and analysis of utilization and forecast data; report generation and all other related NANPA functions.&nbsp; Therefore, the NANPA services are to continue to be provided without interruption.&nbsp; The requirement obligates the contractor to serve as an independent neutral entity responsible for assigning and administering NANPA resources in an efficient, effective, fair, unbiased, and non-discriminatory manner consistent with regulatory directives and industry guidelines, and is required to comply with state regulatory decisions, rules, and orders, as applicable, as long as they are not in conflict with FCC decisions, orders, and rules.&nbsp; The Government intends to award a sole source bridge contract to Neustar, Inc., the incumbent contractor.&nbsp; Neustar, Inc. has been providing the highly specialized services described above to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) since 1997.&nbsp; The existing contract is scheduled to expire on July 8, 2009.&nbsp; The transition period from the incumbent to a new service provider is anticipated to last several months.&nbsp; Due to the considerable transition period anticipated, in addition to the re-competition effort, the FCC has determined that only one contractor - Neustar, Inc. - is capable of meeting the need for uninterrupted continuation of the NANPA services for an interim period until completion of the re-competition.&nbsp; Accordingly, award to any other source other than Neustar, Inc. would result in an unacceptable interruption in fulfilling FCC mission requirements and could severely jeopardize the success of continuing to generate and implement the program as required services after a considerable transition period, the FCC believes that no contractor other than Neustar, Inc. is capable of providing interim services beginning July 9, 2009 until the ongoing re-competition is completed.&nbsp; NANPA services must continue to be providedwithout interruption.&nbsp; Services are to cover a six-month period of performance with&nbsp;2 - six-month option periods.&nbsp; Award was made on July 8, 2009.&nbsp; Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by addressing how it could be able to perform the interim services from July 9, 2009 until the re-competition effort is completed.&nbsp; This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.&nbsp; However, all capability statements received within 15 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the FCC.&nbsp; A determination by the FCC not to compete this proposed contract action based upon response to this notice is solely with the discretion of the FCC.&nbsp; Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.&nbsp; Interested vendors must contact Joyce Terry-Butler, Senior Contracting Specialist/Senior Contracting Officer, FCC/Contracts &amp; Purchasing Center, (202) 418-1857 or via email <a href="mailto:joyce.terry-butler@fcc.gov">joyce.terry-butler@fcc.gov</a></p>

(4)  Proposals must include completed copy of provision at FAR 52.212-3 (Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items) (FEB 2009) or indication that reps and certs are in ORCA.

CLIN 0001-0002:   GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENT (I.E. LINE DECRIPTIONS & MANUFACTURER NAME/PART NUMBERS) IS PROVIDED IN THE ATTACHED “REQUEST FOR OFFER/QUOTES”.

THIS IS A 100% TOTAL SMALL BUISINESS SET-ASIDE PROCUREMENT.  All equipment and associated parts must be as requested as they are part of a complete system/package.  Substitutions will only be considered upon notification an item has been discontinued or replaced for which an amendment to this solicitation will be posted with the new part number (s).  The Government will consider offers/quotes only from “authorized resellers” of the referenced manufacturers.  Contractors are encouraged but not required to quote on all items (aggregate quote must be over $3,000).  The government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government’s best interest to do so(FAR 52.214-22 - Evaluation of Bids for Multiple Awards). Contractor’s offers/quotes must be FOB Destination or will be considered non-responsive.  

The Government will issue an order to the responsible quoter, with acceptable past performance, submitting the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation.  This order will include the following referenced clauses which may be accessed electronically at www.arnet.gov:
	FAR 52.204-9 (Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (SEP 2007)
	FAR 52.212-4 (Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items) (MAR 2009)
	FAR 52.212-5 (Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders-Commercial Items) (APR 2009)
	FAR 52.219-8 (Utilization of Small Business Concerns and Small Disadvantage Business Concerns) (MAY 2004)
	FAR 52.232-33 (Payment by Electronic Funds-Central Contractor Registration) (OCT 2003)
	DFARS 252.204-7004, Alt A (Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (SEP 2007)
	DFARS 252.232-7003 (Electronic Submission of Payment Request) (MAR 2008)
	DFARS 252.246-7000 (Material Inspection and Receiving Report) (MAR 2008)

Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.
Local DMC clauses, 52.0100-4028 (Contract Contact Information)(DMC) (JUN 2005) and 52.0100-4094 (Marking Instructions for All Items to Include Drop Ship and Direct Shipment) (JUN 2004), will be included. 


Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” or the “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the “Invoice” option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

<DESC><p>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), GIG Operations and Sustainment Contracting Branch (PL61), intends to issue a sole source contract to RT Logic. The purpose of this action is to issue a sole source contract to RT Logic Inc. (12515 Academy Ridge View, Colorado Springs, CO 80921) to upgrade Standardized Process for Interference Recognition and Interference Targeting (SPIRIT) UHF Satellite geolocation equipment for the Joint Spectrum Center.
<p>RT Logic will provide delivery, installation, and acceptance testing of an upgraded equipment suite to replace the current QinetiQ hardware. In February 2009, RT Logic acquired the satID software suite from QinetiQ, which is the main software used to perform geolocations. The hardware upgrade is required to ensure a seamless transition of SPIRIT to the Air Force Rapid Attack Identification, Detection and Reporting System (RAIDRS) program in FY10. The RAIDRS satellite sensors in other frequency bands are run on identical RT Logic hardware platforms. RT Logic will also provide on-site training for our personnel and one year of warranty, maintenance and upgrade services on the equipment to the JSC.</p>
<p>This notice of intent expires at 8am EST on 16 July 09. Please contact robert.koplos@disa.mil with questions.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  Using the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct a 6.3 Demonstration Validation Research effort in support of the Adaptive Vehicle Management System (AVMS) program.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  This BAA constitutes the total solicitation for Phase I.  At the conclusion of the Phase I effort, a separate Announcement will be posted to FedBizOpps which will provide information specific to proposal submission/participation in Phase II.  Participation in Phase I is not a requirement for participation in Phase II.  Available data produced in Phase I will be provided upon request to those parties interested in participating in Phase II.  Phase II announcement will be at a later date.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments.<BR><BR>INTRODUCTION:  <BR>The objective of the AVMS BAA is to demonstrate technologies in the areas of vehicle management integration and control, and vehicle performance to support current and future Army Aviation platforms.  This Program encompasses six years  separated into two phases with planned multi awards for both Phase I & II.  Phase I effort is for the tradeoff analysis and preliminary simulation evaluation of the technology components and technology combinations (technology suites).  Phase II will conduct the final simulation and support a flight demonstration of the technology components and/or suite(s) selected.  This announcement requests proposals for only Phase I, whose execution must consider the entire program goals (Ph I & II) to be reasonable.  Thus, general information for PH II is included. <BR><BR>Much work has been performed at Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) over the years demonstrating the capabilities of digital flight controls in vehicle management systems.  Digital flight controls are now the baseline for almost every new helicopter/rotorcraft being designed/produced or as a planned upgrade worldwide.  With the first generation of digital flight controls fielded in production vehicles, many opportunities exist.  The AVMS Program will demonstrate an improved VMS which is more reactive to real time conditions and maintains level 1 handling qualities throughout the entire flight envelope, which together enables improved performance and durability with reduced Operation and Support (O&S) costs.<BR><BR>The pilots control is perceived through the Carefree Maneuvering (CM) capabilities.  Improvements include not only improved aircraft and performance limit identification and improved control law algorithms, but also the VMS response to real time influences (i.e., degraded equipment, damage or environmental conditions) or changing mission equipment requirements (i.e., weight and/or c.g. changes as a load is dropped/launched).  Improving Regime Recognitions (RR) capabilities by utilizing onboard information more effectively (more integration and analytical processing and reducing redundant sources), integrated with different cueing modalities (such as tactile cues) and improved task tailored control laws enables  an AVMS more responsive to changing conditions, enhances CM and reduces the pilot workload.  This enables improved handling qualities, improved performance and improved durability.<BR><BR>AATD intends to investigate and demonstrate an improved CM envelope through improved technology suites which leverage the basic control technologies of the first generation digital vehicle flight controls and as well as prepares for future technologies (i.e., active rotor control, active safety systems, etc.).  AVMS will demonstrate significant improvements for rotorcraft, through new integration approaches and through integrating new technologies for Army rotorcraft.<BR><BR>Many technologies demonstrated in the laboratory environment could have a significant impact on performance, safety, durability and cost.  With the multitude of technologies (such as active control of sling loads, active rotor control, tactile cueing, better vehicle models, fiber optics/photonics, wireless, etc.) moving into the TRL 5 readiness arena and Army platforms required to do more, there is a plethora of possible technology combinations (technology suites)  to improve vehicle performance.  It is not possible to review every possible combination, as well as many of the technology components may need additional work, in a relevant environment to prepare for insertion into the fleet.  Thus, a reasonable set of possible combinations to assess needs to be identified.<BR><BR>Technology components, the constituents of the suites, could be defined as hardware (i.e., sensors), processing methodologies (i.e., control laws generation), performance improvements (i.e., improved algorithms), new combinations of subsystems (i.e., integrate flight and a mission package), architecture/functionality (CM, RR and task tailored control laws) as well as new innovative hardware and/or software solutions.<BR><BR>Additionally, there are technology components, called enabling technologies, which themselves add value to the system, but whose significant value is they enable other technologies to utilize their full potential.  These enabling technologies need to be available with their paired technology, not after.  For this program, the enabling technologies defined include rotor state feedback (active rotor control), load defined control laws (reduce parasitic structure), high reliability weight on wheels sensor and non-physical (i.e., inductive, optical, etc.) contact, safety critical, data transmission from the fixed vehicle to the rotating blade (primary active rotor control). <BR><BR>The AVMS Program will culminate in a demonstration of the candidate technology suite(s) available.  Phase I will investigate the candidates through trade off analysis and simulation evaluation prior to finalizing the technology components and technology suite(s).  The starting point for the suites technologies should be the first generation digital flight control rotorcraft, either in or soon to be in production and promising basic research areas (i.e., autonomous guidance and control, integrated simulation and control tools, active load stabilization and structural response, improved handling qualities in degraded environments, new handling requirements for heavy lift vehicles, etc.).  Most of the technologies are expected to demonstrate a TRL 6/7 prior to the end of this program (Phase I & II).<BR><BR>The tradeoff studies of possible technology suites and constituent components (including enabling technologies) will assess the different characteristics of each suite.  The studies will consider the benefits of each suite, as well as the metrics/definitions for the benefits of the suite and each component, and the ability to demonstrate the technology maturity.  <BR><BR>A suitable methodology, which considers benefits (performance, functionality, durability), risk, and maturation demonstration requirements, to include metrics, will be developed.  <BR><BR>Metrics for the different technologies and combinations shall be defined for use in the Trade-Off Analyses, Simulation Evaluation and the Flight Demonstration (follow on work effort).  Metric areas should include characteristics such as the VMS footprint and costs of dedicated flight control system components, weight, resources required to design/analyze and verify control software and verify & validate (V&V) software to support the next generation Vehicle Management System.  Exit criteria (engineering, performance and mission) defined shall be considered for the entire effort (Phases I & II; analyses, evaluation and demonstration).  <BR><BR>Results of the trade off study will assist in defining the demonstration requirements, metrics, and reduce the possible technology components which:  a.  Have the greatest benefit to future VMS and b.  Can be demonstrated.  (a and b are not necessarily the same list.)  The most promising technology suites with the best approach to quantify the suites and components benefits will be selected for simulation and demonstration.<BR><BR>ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  Anticipated funding ($M) for all Ph I awards is as follows: FY10 (0.88), FY11 (1.0), FY12 (2.0), Period of Performance for Phase I is not to exceed 26 months, with 24 months of technical work and 2 months for the final report.  Offerors should clearly depict their proposed schedule.  There is a potential for multiple awards.  Any award made under this Announcement is subject to the availability of funds.  <BR><BR>TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy.  Such instruments include conventional contracts subject to the FAR, as supplemented, and Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371), which are more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  Under TIA's or OT(s) it is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of half of the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to OT(s) for Research) accessible at the following link: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321006r34p.pdf.<BR>  Contract type is a subject for negotiation, but the offeror's desire should be clearly stated in the cost proposal.<BR><BR>  DATA ITEMS / DELIVERABLES:  All awards under this announcement will require a kickoff meeting following award.  All awards under this Announcement will require delivery of the following data items:  (1) Program Management Plan, (2) Test Plan , (3) Bi-Monthly Performance and Cost Reports (4) Final Report, and (5) Master Design Document.  An interim Final Report, due prior to the final Phase I simulation will be required to inform Industry of the progress and status of this effort.<BR>All awards will include a requirement to present the results of the work in a final briefing at Ft. Eustis, Virginia upon completion of all technical effort.<BR><BR>SECURITY REQUIREMENTS  Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751 e t. seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C. App. 2401 et. seq.  Prior to award, the successful offeror(s) will be required to provide an Export-Controlled DoD Data Agreement certification number issued in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) o Outside the United States.

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that—

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) 
(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<SUBJECT>Evacuation Chairs
<SOLNBR>1060562
<RESPDATE>071309

<DESC>EMERGENCY EVACUATION CHAIRS
The Safety Management Team (SMT) is responsible for planning and managing emergency evacuations from CFSAN facilities. In the course of training lay staff responders in the operation of evacuation chairs last year, SMT Life Safety staff identified 5 critical problems. 

First, it learned that its existing equipment could not be reliably operated in its stairwells that have smaller intermediate landings, as there was insufficient room for turning the apparatus and person without lifting. In order to accommodate both staff and visitors, SMT needs to have evacuation equipment that can transport a person weighing up to 400 lbs. Lay staff responders cannot be expected to lift loaded emergency evacuation chairs in order to negotiate small-area landings.

Second, a problem was identified due to the multiple types of evacuation chairs currently in use in CFSAN metropolitan Washington area facilities. Many staff responders move freely between buildings with differing equipment, making it difficult for them to participate in whatever building they are in at the time of evacuation if they are unfamiliar with that building’s evacuation chairs. Complexity is also introduced into initial and refresher training efforts due to the existing multiple chair types.

Third, some CFSAN egress paths require upward-, rather than traditional downward-, directed operation of evacuation chairs. This is the case for the Wiley building basement, which has no basement-level exit to the outside, but which houses offices, labs, training suites, and an auditorium. Evacuation chairs must be specially designed for two-person fore and aft operation, i.e., be equipped with locking foot end grab handles, in order to ascend stairs without risking the chair overturning or injury to the responders.

Fourth, chairs which require the person being transported to recline during transport are more difficult to load, by lay responders, than are those designed for loading by the individual simply sitting down.

Fifth, heavier chair designs make it more difficult for lay responders to redeploy a chair back up steps to transport additional persons.  The SMT proposes to replace existing evacuation chairs in all of its metropolitan Washington area facilities with a single model that successfully addresses all the incompatibilities or shortcomings noted above.

Specifications for evacuation chair:
To successfully address the incompatibilities and shortcomings noted above, replacement evacuation chairs will need to meet the following requirements:

1. Must have locking foot end lift handle to permit two-person chair lift (some CFSAN facilities have evacuation egress paths from basement occupancies that require ascending steps in stairwell; this requires a 2-person lift)

2. Design must permit navigation by lay responders in stairwells with small landing areas (several CFSAN stairwells have intermediate landings that are too small for operation of reclining-style evacuation chairs by lay responders)

3. Design must permit user to enter chair by sitting down

4. Chair must be light enough (not more than 40 lbs.) to be carried back up steps by lay responders in order to assist additional persons

5. At least 400 lb. weight capacity

6. Quote is for a total of nine (9) evacuation chairs (with wall brackets and chairs covers)

7.DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION MUST BE INCLUDED IN PRICE!

Interested sources shall submit all price, descriptive literature and technical proposals, to Michelle Street, (Contract Specialist), email: Michelle.Street@fda.hhs.gov, or alternate Gina Jackson (Contracting Officer), email: Gina.Jackson@fda.hhs.gov. Please indicate the solicitation number on the outside of your package. Any incomplete responses or responses received after the closing will not be accepted. Faxed copies of proposal package will not be accepted. The coversheet to the proposal shall have the offeror’s information. The price and technical proposal shall only have the solicitation number.

<DESC>RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO JULY 20, 2009 AT 4:30PM EST.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, streamlined procedures for evaluation and solicitation for commercial items-as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued using simplified acquisition procedures 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotations (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporation provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will be not issued.  The associated North American Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 621511.  This procurement will be full and open competition. 

The purpose of this contract is to develop and test a platform that can perform real-time PCR on a nucleic acid sample extracted from blood testing for the presence of 10 or more pathogens simultaneously in a volume less than 25ul.  The platform must be optimized to achieve the greatest degree of sensitivity possible while achieving the highest possible level of multiplicity.  This will be a labor hour contract for one year.

Background:

Nucleic acid detection of pathogens in blood products to increase the safety of transfusion has proven to be the most sensitive and efficient method.  However, with the number of pathogens recommended by the FDA for testing and the constant threat of newly emerging pathogens, the number of individual tests performed on each product unit is becoming burdensome and delays the process of fresh blood products reaching the patients in urgent need.  To solve this problem, multiplex Nucleic Acid Tests (NATs) have been developed.  To date the highest number of pathogens that can be assayed in one multiplex test licensed for blood screening is three, HIV, HCV and HBV.  New technology must be developed that can achieve higher levels of multiplicity.

Scope of Work:

NAT assays targeted to specific blood borne pathogens are comprised of oligonucleotide primer pairs and a set of reaction conditions that have been optimized to give the most efficient amplification of the target.  Such NAT assays have been developed by scientists in the Division of Emerging and Transfusion Transmitted Diseases for at least ten different blood borne pathogens individually.  

The contractor will take these primer pairs and associated reaction conditions and combine them into a Nanoscale Multiplex platform that can perform real-time PCR with at least 10 reactions simultaneously.  The platform will also incorporate internal standards to provide quantitative and QA/QC for each test.  

The FDA investigators will provide nucleic acid samples extracted from the various pathogens as well as nucleic acid extracted from blood samples that have been spiked with pathogens.  The contractor will use these samples to evaluate and optimize the performance of the Nanoscale Multiplex platform.  The contractor will report the data on limits of detection of each pathogen when assayed on the Nanoscale Multiplex platform.

The Contractor will perform these tasks:

Task 1.0	Meet with the project officer and develop study design.

Subtask 1.1	The Contractor shall meet with the Government Project Officer (PO) within two weeks after the date of award to discuss the study design and requirements.  The study design described in the proposal will be reviewed at this meeting.
Subtask 1.2	The contractor shall prepare and submit a summary report of the meeting not later than seven (7) days after the meeting.
Task 2.0	Receive blood pathogen oligonucleotide primers and reaction conditions for individual pathogen detection NAT assays
Subtask 2.1	Accept delivery of blood pathogen primers, notify sender of receipt, store properly
Task 3.0	Assemble Nanoscale Multiplex PCR processing devices with blood pathogen primer sets
Subtask 3.1	Load individual primer pairs into nanoscale reaction chambers in multi-chamber array
Subtask 3.2	Store arrays for subsequent sample processing
Task 4.0	Receive and store nucleic acid samples from cultured pathogens
Task 5.0	Optimize detection with pathogen nucleic acid

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed by a potential quoter.

The questions posed were as follows:

It would be helpful to have more information on this system being requested:  Size of substrate, how much tilt, are the power supplies DC or RF and what size power supplies? 

Will you be sputtering metals or organics? Do you need two sputtering power supplies for co sputtering or will one do with the ability to run either gun?

The answers provided by the technical contact are as follows:

1. Size of substrate: the rotary stage platform should be able to accommodate a typical 3” x 1” microscope slide. In certain instances we may wish to coat a 100 mm diameter wafer, however, the critical samples are all quite small (3 mm x 2 mm chips, 2 mm x 20 mm ferrules, etc) and will typically be mounted on something akin to a microscope slide.

2. Tilt: We have no definite requirement. An ability to vary the tilt between 0 and 45 degrees is desirable.

3. Sputtering material: the as delivered system must be set up and have all necessary sources and accessories to sputter a chrome adhesion layer followed by gold without incurring the need to break vacuum between steps in the process.

4. Co sputtering is not a minimum requirement, but may be viewed as advantageous when comparing vendor quotes.

The question regarding whether the power supplies are DC or RF and what size power supplies are included are sub-system components that really aren’t in our purview to specify in such detail. These should be regarded as component descriptions of the system proposed.

All terms and conditions of the original solicitation remain unchanged, including the closing date (June 2, 2009).

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer a question posed by a potential quoter.

Question:  I have a question regarding #9 – Plasma Cleaning Option:

Do they want just the head, that can be used with the power supply (two heads at one time, either 2 sputtering heads or 1 sputtering head + plasma cleaning head), or do they want the capability to have 2 sputtering heads plus the plasma cleaning head all active in one run?

Answer:  The best solution for us is to have 2 sputtering heads plus the plasma cleaning head all active in one run.

All terms and conditions of the original solicitation, including the closing date and time, remain unchanged.

<DESC>The purpose of this  amendment is to display questions and answers publicly:

1.     Is it possible to delay the due date by one week?

Due to time constraints we cannot consider extending the due date at 
this time. I will send your questions to the end-user for a response 
to the rest of your questions.


2.      From what is written in this solicitation, it appears that the 
2500 foot distribution system is not a circulating piping system. Does 
the water leave the existing system and recirculate back to the 
existing system to keep polishing the water quality?  If the piping 
loop is a dead leg system, it will be hard to maintain water quality 
at the outlets.

Answer
The DI water distribution system is indeed a "loop", as stated in the original request.  The system is designed to loop the water back to the purification system for repolishing.

3.      No where does it say what the flow rate for the distribution 
pump is.  What flow rate?  The RO machine is capable of supplying 35 
L/HR per line item 4.d.

Answer
The purification apparatus should NOT directly feed into the DI water loop, but into the storage tank.  From the storage tank, the distribution pump should be capable of maintaining a water pressure of 2-6 bar.  Basic attributes of a  DI water distribution system is that the flow rate MUST be > 2 m/s to prevent microbial growth.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation for PR# 1300126039 is issued as request for quotes (RFQ) and incorporates the provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-30, Effective 17 Feb 2009. The SIC Code for this solicitation is 3577, the FSC Code is 6930, and the NAICS Code is 334119. 

The Government intends to set aside 100% of this requirement to a Small Business entity as stated in 
FAR 19.502-2 - Total Small Business Set-Asides.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<CONTACT>Diane J Meeder, Contract Specialist, Phone (412)386-4412, Email DMeeder@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), Division of Health Studies (DHS) has a requirement for the Formation of a Community Action Committee and Myeloproliferative Disease (MPD) Patient Support.
<p>This procurement is being issued as a total small business set aside under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Under SAP procedures, the aggregate amount of which does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (FAR 2.101). At the time of this requirement the SAT means $100,000.00.</p>
<p>C.1 Background and Need - The residents in the recently identified polycythemia vera (PV) cluster area in eastern Pennsylvania have a long history of mistrust with local, state, and federal agencies in the area of environmental public health. Over the next 6 months, at least 6 separate research projects studying the polycythemia vera cluster will begin which will have an impact on the communities. In order to ensure that the communities are informed about the various projects and have the ability to communicate effectively with the researchers, a formal community action committee (CAC) is needed. Currently there is a small group of local residents who have brought attention to the environmental problems in the area and have interacted with state and federal agencies. The proposed CAC will be built around the existing informal group in such a way that the various interests of the community are represented. CAC members will serve on a volunteer basis. It is critical that the CAC has the full support and involvement of the local communities, which can only be assured by an entity with an established connection to the communities and a demonstrated focus on MPD research. The primary mission of the CAC is to represent the community in all interactions with state, federal and private entities conducting MPD-related research in the area. This includes providing information resources and support to local MPD patients regarding access to treatment, clinical trials, and PV research studies.</p>
<p>This project is an integral part of a comprehensive CDC response investigating the occurrence, trends, and associated risk factors of PV and other MPDs not only in the cluster area in Pennsylvania but also on a national level. Many of the projects require the support and cooperation of the local community, and thus a well-organized group representing the community's needs and interests is mandatory. The data collected by CDC as a result of this work will allow us to better respond to cancer clusters with suspected environmental origins. In addition, our understanding of the etiology of MPDs and other hematological cancers will be greatly enhanced leading to improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these illnesses.</p>
<p>C.2 Project Objectives -</p>
<p>1. Assist with the organization of and support a formal Community Advisory Committee (CAC) representing the communities in the cluster area using the existing informal community group as core members. The purpose of this committee is to receive information from and provide input to various groups involved in environmental and MPD-related research in the area. <br />2. Provide informational support for MPD patients and their families that includes informing patients on key advances in MPD research, access to treatment and clinical trials, and an interface with government organizations on key patient issues.</p>
<p>C.3 Scope of Work - The contractor will provide support for the development and support of a CAC to represent the cluster area population in MPD research-related issues. The CAC will be built around an existing core group in such a way as to represent the various interests of the community. The contractor will conduct an initial assessment of the core group and community to determine the appropriate composition of the CAC and the process by which members and officers are selected. The contractor will also secure an appropriate meeting place; develop and manage a budget; conduct regular meetings; produce reports, minutes and other documents; and assist the CAC in obtaining expert technical advice on relevant environmental health issues. The primary purpose of the committee is to provide a mechanism for communication between the community and various environmental and MPD research groups and organizations.</p>
<p>The entire scope of work requirements and evaluation factors will be included in the solicitation.</p>
<p>This procurement is being issued as a total small business set aside under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures, not to exceed SAT of $100,000.</p>
<p>The CDC expects to award one (1) Firm-Fixed Price contract with a period of performance of twenty four (24) months.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document 2009-Q-11466, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> on or about July 16, 2009. Proposals will be due on or about August 17, 2009. No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted. Faxed or electronic submissions will not be accepted.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of perspective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOps internet site.</p>

<DESC>The solicitation is being issued with the intention of awarding an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC).  The resultant contract will have a two year base period with two, one year option periods.  The guaranteed Minimum dollar value per year is $100,000.00.    The annual estimated Quantity(s) (AEQ) per year are as follows: 
      NSN

  ** NOTE:  These are estimates only.  The actual quantities ordered may be less based on the availability of existing serial numbers for the ANSI protocol RFID tags. 

The U S Army has awarded, on a competitive basis, a new procurement vehicle that will introduce upgraded ISO 18000-7 Active RFID tags.  There is a very controlled migration plan taking place over an extended period during which tags must be converted by the Army and DLA from the ANSI standard to the new ISO standard.  Quantities of the unconverted ANSI INCITS tags must be maintained in DLA inventory until all service write stations have been converted to the ISO protocol. This proposed contract to Savi Technology is essential for the successful transition from the ANSI INCITS technology to the ISO 18000-7 technology.  Once the transition is completed the need for ANSI protocol tags will be eliminated and the option to extend this contract may not be exercised.  Solicitation SPM8EF-09-R-0001 is expected to be issued July 14, 2009 with an expected closing date of July 30, 2009.  These dates are subject to change.

<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities
(MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Foam Ear Plugs.

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.

The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is August 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.
The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Foam Ear Plugs product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Foam Ear Plugs product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.

B.	Products & Performance Required.

The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Foam Ear Plugs, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.
Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $55,791.11.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.

At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line .

C.	Instructions to Vendors.
Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their responses with (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of the RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.

This process will require vendors to provide electronic responses to technical criteria upon request in the prescribed format of Microsoft Word, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes in the prescribed format of Microsoft Excel.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors need to confirm with the Central Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor must confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  

Responses should be sent to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.

D.	Evaluation Criteria.  

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) from the Central Region which is composed of Physicians, Nurses, Medical Technicians, Infection Control Officers and other clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products will develop and approve the technical/company and clinical/performance criteria as well as the evaluation process to be used along with the requirement for product sample sets and literature from the product group.  

Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.
Vendors are required to meet and provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.
NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:

Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:  
1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Ear Protection Foam products.  A 'complete line of product' is defined as the MTFs'
requirements for 'usage items' in the product line.  'Usage items' are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: Ear plugs, foam, in packs of two each. Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.
2.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Foam Ear Plugs product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) 3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be
disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization
initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. 
5.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. 

Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.
Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by COB, 3PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendor's product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 5 calendar days.
The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a
1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.

The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: 

Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 

1. Ear plug does not damage ear canal
       
2. Ear plug fits securely.
      
3. Ear Plug has smooth outer surface.
       

Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.
Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  

After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).
The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendor's products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the DAPA price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.
The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 10 July 2009 3PM CDT

Belkin is currently the only manufacturere of a TAA Compliant KVM Suite and GITM has therefore been using the Belkin KVM Suite of equipment exclusively. The Belkin KVM Suite of equipment cannot be used without the Interface Adapters. The Belkin KVM Adapters listed above will be used with Belkin KVM Switches that were previously purchased on order 1019-832222 (SAQMMA08F5196). Cisco equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities taht requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches: HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). APC Smart-UPS Units are IRm ITCCB-approved hardware and have been used to provide power protection for several years. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested byt the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and calssified IT refreshes. IRM/OPS/ITI/GITM identified the Rack Solutions 19-Inch Rack-Mount Shelf as the only suitable item availble in the market today meeting the Department's requirements regarding cost, capacity, performance, packaging, durability and easy of use with the current GITM Netowrk backup Soultion. Furthermore, the equipment listed in paragraph (2) is on the IRM ITCCB approved hardware list. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department of compatibility with existing hardware and software will place the Deaprtment at risk and will casue unacceptable delays to the Program's scheudle in support of the unclassifed and classified IT refresh efforts. Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquistion is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. As this is a brand name only justifcation, no one contractor's unique qualificatiosn are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Deparment's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) has undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassifed and classified networks.<BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>RFI for Authorized release of Medical Information through integration with the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN)
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFP-10-1001
<RESPDATE>072209
<CONTACT>Syreeta  Gay, Email SSA.HIT.Draft.RFP.Comments@ssa.gov
<DESC>RECOVERY--THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire services.  Response to this RFI will be treated as information only.  The Government will not pay for information provided in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests.  The information provided may be used by the Social Security Administration in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work.  

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to exchange information with industry related to its efforts to improve the speed and quality of its Disability Determination Process.  

BACKGROUND:  SSA is responsible for the Nation’s two primary Federal Disability Programs: Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income.  Due to the significant growth in disability applications over the last 5 years, the increased complexity of those applications, limited resources, medical advances, changing health information technology, and outdated policies, our ability to process disability applications have fallen short of our own expectations.  We request an estimated 15-20 million medical records each year from healthcare facilities (hospitals, clinics, physicians, psychologists, and other health professionals) across the country to obtain evidence of an individual’s medical condition.  Providing medical records is very labor-intensive and expensive for healthcare facilities.  In addition, some facilities require the use of their own forms and some do not respond to our requests for medical records at all.  As a result, we are forced to obtain and retain paper originals of authorization forms and in some instances schedule consultative examinations when medical sources do not respond to our requests.  The current process results in significant burdens on applicants, providers, and the government.  

OBJECTIVE: While there is no single solution to improve our disability determination process; one of SSA’s proposed solutions is to expand our current Medical Evidence Gathering and Analysis through Health Information Technology (MEGAHIT) project by recruiting additional health care providers and networks to automate the exchange of medical records.  Automating the solution for Release of Information will save time and money for the providers and will also make SSA’s decision determination process more efficient and effective.  To achieve this goal, SSA contemplates awarding fixed price contracts to expand the number of healthcare providers participating in the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN).  This will be done through a full and open, competitive, fixed-price request for proposal (RFP) contracting process.  SSA hopes to award contracts to organizations representing Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs), General Medical Service Providers/Facilities and Specialty Care Providers/Facilities. This effort will be funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) funds and payment will be made to awarded contractors upon successful completion of the implementation and successful response to several production requests from SSA with the transmission of verified Continuity of Care Documents (CCD).

Information submitted in response to this RFI will be used to gauge interest of healthcare providers willing to participate in the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN), develop the capability to receive standardized electronic requests for medical evidence of record (MER), patient authorization and respond to requests with structured medical information through a CCD(s).  SSA will also use the RFI responses to help develop a Request for Proposal that will lead to contracts for the implementation of the MEGAHIT project.  

SSA seeks information from industry for preliminary planning purposes ONLY.  This RFI will allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the government’s requirement and to affirm that there is a general understanding of the requirement.  This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or to award a contract.  The Government will not pay for information provided in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests.  

A detailed description of the project is contained in the attached DRAFT RFP.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fbo.gov. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation.  In addition, this effort will be funded with Recovery Act funds; therefore the solicitation will contain the clauses at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-5, Alternate II, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items.  Specifically, the following:

•52.203-15 – Whistleblower Protections Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Mar 2009)
•52.204-11 - American Recovery and Reinvestment Act - Reporting Requirements (Mar 2009)
•52.215-2 Alternate I, Audit and Records-Negotiation  


Responses from industry MUST be submitted via email to SSA.HIT.Draft.RFP.Comments@ssa.gov by July 22, 2009.   No phone calls will be accepted.  The subject line of the submission should be “RFI for Authorized release of Medical Information to SSA through integration with the NHIN”.  Responses must include the following information: 

1. Company/Facility name, address, point of contact, phone number and email address. 

2. Type of healthcare organization (Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs), General Medical Service Providers/Facilities and/or Specialty Care Providers/Facilities). 

3. Does your company use an electronic health records system?   

4. Who is your electronic health records software vendor?

5. Does your company have experience in exchanging electronic health records?  If so, with whom?

6. What additional information from the Government would you need to develop a proposal?

7. Describe the risks associated with participating in this effort (business, operational, technical) and what actions could be taken to mitigate these risks?

8. If we issue a Request for Proposals, would you submit a proposal?  If not, why?

9. Do you have any other concerns/comments or recommendations regarding the Draft RFP or proposed acquisition approach? Specifically, we seek input on the following documents:

-Statement of Work (RFP Section B-1)
-Electronic Health Records Content Checklist (RFP Section E)
-SSA’s Implementation Guide (www.socialsecurity.gov/hit)
-Instructions to Offerors (RFP Section F)
-Proposed Evaluation Criteria (RFP Section G-1(d))

10. Though contracts awarded as a result of a Request for Proposals will not include payment for the receipt of medical information, what would you consider a fair price (based on actual costs incurred) for your company to provide a patient's medical information in response to our request for medical information, assuming that the process is entirely automated?  Please explain the rationale for your answer.

11. Should we adjust the price over time? If so, what price is fair in the short-term? What price is fair in the long-term?  Please explain the rationale for your answer (including how you would define short-term).

We emphasize that this RFI is for planning and information purposes. No solicitation exists; therefore, requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored.

<DESC>****SUBJECT PROJECT WILL BE FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA).   APPROPRIATE ARRA CLAUSES WILL BE INCLUDED IN SOLICITATION**********

NOTE:  ALL CORRESPONDANCE CONCERNING THIS ACQUISITION MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING NUMBER:  GS-03P-09-CD-C-0064

The United States General Services Administration has a requirement for the selection of a quality contractor for the “Recovery” Roof Replacement at the Abingdon Federal Courthouse in Abingdon, Virginia.  

This project is to be awarded as a firm fixed price contract.    Award of any contract resulting from this solicitation is subject to availability of funds which will be appropriated by the “American Recovery and Reinvestment Act”.  All costs associated with proposal preparation in response to this solicitation are the responsibility of the offeror.  Should no award result from this solicitation, the Government shall have no obligation to pay any costs to the offeror.

The awarded contractor will provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment, and shall plan work schedules and coordination. The work includes but is not limited to the following:  provide all construction services necessary for the removal of the existing built up roofing system, repair of existing brick masonry, provision for new rubber pavers, installation of EPDM roofing membrane and standing-seam metal roofing system as well as installation of new roof accessed metal stairs and platform.  The contractor’s personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  The period of performance for this project is one hundred and eighty (180) days.  The estimated cost of construction is between $550,000.00 and $750,000.00.  

This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 238160.  The award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.  Accordingly, an award will be made using best-value, source-selection procedures incorporating tradeoffs between price-related and non-price related factors.  

The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  (1.) Past Performance Experience and (2.) Key Personnel Qualifications.    Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer will preclude further participation on this acquisition.     

Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical 
and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will 
be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Pursuant to FAR 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a).  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  An award may be made without discussions.  

This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice. 

A Pre-proposal conference will be held at the Abingdon Federal Courthouse in Abingdon, VA.  The date and time will be posted via modification to this announcement.   

To ensure that you receive all information regarding this solicitation, please register to receive updates at www.fedbizopps.gov, follow the procedures for notification registration. 

TENTATIVE DATE TO FOR ISSUANCE OF RFP IS ON OR ABOUT JULY 10. The Solicitation (RFP) will only be available electronically.   The solicitation (specifications, drawings, clauses and bid forms) can only be obtained by accessing FedBizOpps, a secure website. FedBizOpps is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition material. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation (specifications, drawings, clauses and bid forms) and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information. Potential offerors must register on the FedBizOpps website to have access to solicitation material.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION. This action is Work Authorization No. RA-09-01 issued under Management & Operating (M&O) Contract number DE-AC52-06NA25946 which is funded by the American Recovery and Rehabilitation Act (ARRA) dollars. The M&O Contractor DUNS number is 195194779.  

The description of the work involved under this work authorization is as follows:  The ARRA objectives for the Environmental Management effort on the Nevada Test Site (NTS) includes assessing the degree of contamination of support facilities, soils, and groundwater resulting from the historic nuclear weapons testing program; and performing corrective actions required by federal and state regulations.  The goal is to implement appropriate corrective actions and establish institutional controls to ensure the protection of human health and the environment.
		
Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Contract for WA* (added to description in FedBizOpps):

Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award: Contract Clause DEAR 970.5243.1, Changes (DEC 2000), of the contract authorizes the Contracting Officer to make changes within the general scope of the M&O contract.  The work scope considered for acceleration as a result of the receipt of the ARRA funds is clearly within the scope of the contract.  The prospects for performing the ARRA scope of work under a firm fixed-price (FFP) contract were evaluated prior to issuance of the modification. The work contemplated is highly complex and many variables exist that do not lend themselves to the use of a fixed-price contract (FAR16.601(c)).  NNSA/NSO has communicated to the M&O contractor that FFP subcontracts shall be utilized to the maximum extent possible in accomplishing the specific tasks executed with ARRA funds.

Place of Contract Performance:
•	NNSA Complex in Clark County, Nevada
•	Nevada Test site located in Nye County, Nevada.
•	Nevada Test & Training Range (NTTR), Tonopah, Nevada

<DESC><p>Recovery Action: The Recovery Action project entitled "Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline MIE at SNS Full Funding (ORNL)" allows the acceleration of two major efforts (HVAC and Utilities) that are part of the overall Fundamental Neutron Physics Beam (FNPB) external experimental building at the Spallation Neutron Source at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This modification provides $60,000.00 previously held in risk reserve to optimize project execution by advancing the schedule for some tasks as compared to the previously approved project plan. The FNPB project is a beam-line that will deliver record peak currents of cold and ultra-cold neutrons for studying the fundamental properties of the neutron, leading to a refined characterization of the weak force. The DUNS number is 0991142870000.
<p>Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award: As the Management and Operating (M&amp;O) contractor, UT-Battelle is responsible for all activities at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the facilities located at the site. The Statement of Work (SOW) for the ORNL M&amp;O contract primarily addresses the conduct of basic and applied research and development (R&amp;D) to advance scientific knowledge, the nation's energy resources, national security and environmental quality and to strengthen educational foundations and national economic competitiveness. However, also included in the SOW are requirements for many other non-R&amp;D types of work consistent with the Department of Energy's mission. The work referenced in this synopsis has been reviewed by the Contracting Officer and determined to be within existing scope. UT-Battelle anticipates numerous subcontracting opportunities for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funded projects and plans to conduct competitive, fixed-price procurements for much of the work. Many of the subcontracting opportunities will be directed at small businesses. This funding action is a revision to an existing Recovery Act funded project.</p>

<SUBJECT>Clean up of the West Valley Demonstration Project

<AWARDEE> West Valley Environmental Services,  10282 Rock Springs Road
			      , West Valley, NY 14171 US
<DESC><p>Synopsis: <br />Clean up of the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP) was mandated by Congress through the West Valley Demonstration Project Act of 1982. A competitive contract was awarded in June 2007 to continue clean up efforts begun under previous contracts. After award changes in overall priorities, projected funding levels, and compliance with new and or changed regulatory requirements resulted in expanding work scope, and rescheduling work required to be completed under the contract.
<p>This award modifies the current contract to allow work efforts that were displaced or delayed by rescheduling to be completed to the original contract schedule, provides for completion of certain scopes of work ahead of the original contract schedule and adds work scope that will further clean up of the WVDP sooner than anticipated.</p>
<p>The scopes of work covered by the modification are:<br /><br />Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&amp;D) of the Main Plant Process Building including removal of all vessels and process piping within the building by June 30, 2011. This effort was delayed and this award places it back on schedule.</p>
<p>Characterize, process and package for disposal Transuranic Waste and Mixed Transuranic Waste in accordance with new requirements issued after contract award.</p>
<p>Obtain, install and use a system to solidify contaminated liquid wastes that are generated during the Decontamination and Decommissioning of the Main Plant Process Building. Solidifying contaminated liquid waste eliminates the risk that a contaminated liquid will leak or leach out of its container. Handling solid waste is safer, and easier than handling and storing liquid waste as originally planned in the contract.</p>
<p>Isolate the Waste Tank Farm and installation of a drying system within the Tank and Vault system. The metal High Level Liquid waste tanks are located in an underground facility a drying system is required to prevent dampness and corrosion of the tanks.</p>
<p>Install a barrier system to filter and remove Strontium 90 from the North Plateau water plume. This method will be more economical and effective than the current method of treatment.<br /><br />Decontaminate, Demolish and remove the O1-14 Building, providing for demolition and removal of the building at the same time as decontamination is more cost effective overall than doing the work in separate efforts.</p>
<p>Isolate Lagoons 2, 3, 4, and 5. The lagoons held water generated on site for various purposes until the water was determined to be safe to discharge off site. The lagoons are no longer needed and shutting down the pipes that carry water into the lagoons will prevent any more water being added.</p>
<p>Decontaminate, Decommission and Demolish the Vitrification Facility by <br />September 30, 2010, this speeds up completion from the original contract required completion of this work by June 30, 2011</p>
<p>Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:</p>
<p>Some of the work to be done was already awarded to the contractor under a competitive contract, there would be significant contract issues involved in taking this work away and making the contractor re-compete for work they already have. <br />The WVDP is situated on approximately 240 acres however the majority of the facilities are concentrated on a parcel approximately &frac14; of a square mile in size. The current WVDP staff is very limited and does not have enough personnel to provide oversight of multiple contractors, and having multiple contractors working in the same limited area increases safety and performance risks.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION. This action is Revision No 1 to Work Authorization RA-09-01 issued under Management & Operating (M&O) Contract number DE-AC52-06NA25946 which is funded by the American Recovery and Rehabilitation Act (ARRA) dollars. This revision incorporates additional baseline and reporting requirements for work performed under the ARRA.  The M&O Contractor DUNS number is 195194779.  The ARRA objectives for the Environmental Management effort on the Nevada Test Site (NTS) includes assessing the degree of contamination of support facilities, soils, and groundwater resulting from the historic nuclear weapons testing program; and performing corrective actions required by federal and state regulations.  The goal is to implement appropriate corrective actions and establish institutional controls to ensure the protection of human health and the environment.
		
Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Contract for WA* (added to description in FedBizOpps):

Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award: Contract Clause DEAR 970.5243.1, Changes (DEC 2000), of the contract authorizes the Contracting Officer to make changes within the general scope of the M&O contract.  The work scope considered for acceleration as a result of the receipt of the ARRA funds is clearly within the scope of the contract.  The prospects for performing the ARRA scope of work under a firm fixed-price (FFP) contract were evaluated prior to issuance of the modification. The work contemplated is highly complex and many variables exist that do not lend themselves to the use of a fixed-price contract (FAR16.601(c)).  NNSA/NSO has communicated to the M&O contractor that FFP subcontracts shall be utilized to the maximum extent possible in accomplishing the specific tasks executed with ARRA funds.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION. This action is Revision No 2 to Work Authorization RA-09-01 issued under Management & Operating (M&O) Contract number DE-AC52-06NA25946 which is funded by the American Recovery and Rehabilitation Act (ARRA) dollars. This revision clarifies and incorporates the efforts required to support the ARRA work scope being performed by the NNSA/NSO Environmental Services Contractor.  The ARRA objectives for the Environmental Management effort on the Nevada Test Site (NTS) includes assessing the degree of contamination of support facilities, soils, and groundwater resulting from the historic nuclear weapons testing program; and performing corrective actions required by federal and state regulations.  The goal is to implement appropriate corrective actions and establish institutional controls to ensure the protection of human health and the environment.
		
Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Contract for WA* (added to description in FedBizOpps):

Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award: Contract Clause DEAR 970.5243.1, Changes (DEC 2000), of the contract authorizes the Contracting Officer to make changes within the general scope of the M&O contract.  The work scope considered for acceleration as a result of the receipt of the ARRA funds is clearly within the scope of the contract.  The prospects for performing the ARRA scope of work under a firm fixed-price (FFP) contract were evaluated prior to issuance of the modification. The work contemplated is highly complex and many variables exist that do not lend themselves to the use of a fixed-price contract (FAR16.601(c)).  NNSA/NSO has communicated to the M&O contractor that FFP subcontracts shall be utilized to the maximum extent possible in accomplishing the specific tasks executed with ARRA funds.

<DESC>Recovery Action:  This action is assigning a Work Authorization AT/NS50/9/ARRA-1, funded with Recovery Act dollars under the referenced M&O contract (Contractor DUNS Number 785627931).  

The work authorization description of work covers:  LLNL will engineer, design and install two high speed infrared (IR) camera systems on the DIII-D Tokamak, in addition funds will support design and fabrication of a wide angle IR/visible periscope for installation on the D-III Tokamak.

Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Contract for WA*:
The work authorization and work scope is priced as an “Other than Fixed Price” action under the terms and conditions of the DOE/LLNS cost re-imbursement, management and operating contract.  In accordance with FAR 5.705(b), the rationale for pricing this action “Other than Fixed Price” is because this work is Research and Development, and work performed at LLNL is based on full cost recovery.
