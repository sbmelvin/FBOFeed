Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office (YAO), Yuma, Arizona has a requirement for removal and replacement of an entire Reactivator Assembly inside an existing 32' diameter by 22' high concrete tank located in the Pilot System 1 (PS1) Desalination Plant. The work is located about 4 miles west of Yuma, Arizona, in Yuma County, at the Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Desalting Complex.
The principal features of work to be performed under this solicitation/specification consists of: 1) Predesign Inspection Trip to the Site; 2) Design and Fabrication of a complete Reactivator Assembly equivalent to the existing Reactivator designed and installed by Graver Water in 1984; 3) Removal of existing Reactivator assembly; 4) Installation of new Reactivator Assembly; 5) Performance Test. 
The PS1 is a 1/100th scale model of the Yuma Desalting Plant (YDP), functionally identical to the larger plant. Congress required the PS1 be built in conjunction with the YDP so that new technologies could be tested and proved in a scale model before implementation in the larger production plant. Implementation of new water treatment technologies in the YDP is a very costly affair and potentially disruptive to the Water Treaty with Mexico. If the scale model, PS1, which is used in the proving of these new technologies, is in any way different than the full scale model, the scale model will be flawed. Implementing a new treatment process in the YDP based on a flawed model could result in a very costly and disruptive mistake. Additionally, all the testing that was performed in the pilot plant would have been wasted effort and time.
The estimated price range for this construction project is between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.  The performance period for this acquisition is 210 calendar days.
The North American Industry System Code (NAICS) for this action is 237110 Water & Sewer Line & Related Structures Construction with a Small Business Size Standard of $33.5 million.  This acquisition will be competitive unrestricted full and open competition.
There will be no public bid opening as competitive proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technical Acceptable Source Selection Process and the evaluation criteria included in the solicitation.  The resultant award is expected to be a firm-fixed-price contract. 
The solicitation and any amendments to the solicitation will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (www.fedbizopps.gov) website.  The extent of the work will be described in the solicitation when it is posted on or about February 20, 2013, under Solicitation number R13PS34013.  
All dates in this notice are estimates and are subject to change.  No other information will be available before the solicitation is posted.    NOTE:
The Solicitation will be issued electronically, as will any amendments thereto, in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.5 and 5.102(a)(1); therefore, hard copies will not be provided.  There will not be any printed or hard copies of the Solicitation mailed.  Additionally, most public libraries have resources available to electronically access and download the Solicitation.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE
Two-Phase Design-Build - Lake Pleasant Visitor Center Upgrades 
Solicitation Number:  INR13PS30001
BACKGROUND: The United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), owns the visitor center located at Lake Pleasant Regional Park north of Phoenix, Maricopa County, Arizona.  The visitor center and park are managed by Maricopa County Parks and Recreation.  
The Lake Pleasant Regional Park Visitor Center is located on a terrace at the western end of New Waddell Dam.  It was constructed in 1990 by Reclamation as an overlook where visitors could observe construction of the new dam.  Professionally designed exhibits featuring prehistoric and historic objects from Reclamation collections were installed inside including a large park map that showed points of interest using a push-button lighting system.
With the completion of New Waddell Dam in 1993, the visitor center has continued to provide an exceptional opportunity for visitors to be introduced to the diverse resources of the Park.  In the ensuing years, Park staff has added a wide variety of material to complement and enhance the original exhibits. These include brochures and promotional literature, additional exhibits, found objects, live animals, and growing inventory of snacks, beverages, and gift items for sale.  These diverse materials occupy every available space and then some, and offer little in the way of an organized, consistent educational presentation.
The trend in visitation has been increasing over the years, and in 2009, the Visitor Center hosted nearly 45,000 guests and netted over $41,000 in snack and souvenir sales. Visitation and sales are expected to continue to increase in coming years.
Twenty years later, the Visitor Center is in great need of refurbishment. 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  Reclamation has a requirement to evaluate, design, and remodel approximately 2,500 gross square foot visitor center; to refurbish, upgrade and update the centers facilities, interpretive exhibits, and information services.
Water is the one common thread that is woven throughout the history of the park and the surrounding area.  From the earliest prehistoric hunter/gatherers to the present, water has been the key resource for people living in the area. The Vision is to use "water" as the common theme, to highlight the environmental, cultural, engineering (Old Waddell Dam and the New Waddell Dam), natural history, and recreational features of the area. The Goal is to make the visitor center a true "Discovery Center" and a key visitor destination.
To fulfill the Vision and accomplish the Goal, a variety of issues must be addressed:  utilities need to be upgraded and alternative "Green" solutions should be considered; exhibit, sales, and media areas must be improved, revised and updated; and the existing structure must be used for the upgrade.  
PROCUREMENT APPROACH: A design-build, construction project is anticipated with an estimated price range between $500,000 and $1,000,000.
This requirement will be a competitive, Total Small Business Set-Aside.
The design and construction is expected to last 365 calendar days.
There will be no public bid opening as competitive proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Subpart 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedures, FAR Part 15, and the evaluation criteria included in the solicitation.  The resultant award is expected to be a firm-fixed-price contract.
The design-build construction to be procured is classified in the North American Industry Classification System code 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a size standard of $33.5M.  
The solicitation and any amendments to the solicitation will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (www.fbo.gov) website.  The extent of the work will be described in the solicitation when it is posted on or about March 15, 2013, under Solicitation number INR13PS30001.  Only up to three of the highest qualified offerors selected after evaluation of the Phase One proposals will be invited to participate in Phase Two of the solicitation.  
The projected award date is on or about August 9, 2013.  All dates in this notice are estimates and are subject to change.  No other information will be available before the solicitation is posted.  
NOTE: The Solicitation will be issued electronically, as will any amendments thereto, in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.5 and 5.102(a)(1); therefore, hard copies will not be provided.  There will not be any printed or hard copies of the Solicitation mailed.  Additionally, most public libraries have resources available to electronically access and download the Solicitation.  Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders list.

<SUBJECT>Acquisition of carrier trays for operating Titertek Quadflex liquid handling system
<SOLNBR>2013-Q-15400
<RESPDATE>021613
<CONTACT>Liubov A. Kriel, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882856, Email vyh1@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Science (DLS), intends to award a sole source purchase order to Titertek Instruments, Inc., 330 Wynn Dr. NW, Suite 100, Huntsville, AL 35805-1965 for the purchase of carrier trays for operating Titertek Quadflex liquid handling system.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase customized carrier trays for operating one-of-a-kind Titertek Quadflex liquid handling system, which produces dried blood spot materials for newborn screening quality assurance (QA). This type of liquid handling system is the only one in the world. The lab needs additional trays and equipment for the system in order to increase capacity and through-put of dried-blood spot QA materials. Titertek Instruments, Inc. is the only responsible source capable of meeting the Government's requirement because they are the only vendor who has the ability to make these customized carrier trays for the liquid handling system that is used to make close to a million spots per year. The Titertek Quadflex liquid handling system dispenses whole human blood at the lab specifications onto specialized filter paper cards. The filter paper cards are held by carrier tray that is made specifically by Titertek for the Titertek Quadflex liquid handling system. There carrier trays are customized to hold the specially sized filter paper cards and to hold these cards in place and facilitate complete drying of the applied blood spots. Each tray holds only nine cards so it takes many trays to make the thousands of dried blood spot cards that are needed each quarter. Other liquid handling systems cannot dispense whole blood for making dried blood spot QA materials to the agency's specifications. Thus, Titertek Instruments, Inc., the manufacturer of customized Titertek carrier trays for Titertek Quadflex liquid handling system, is the only company that can be used.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Titertek Instruments, Inc.. However, firms that believe they can meet these requirements are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice by providing a capability statement to the Contract Specialist by February 16, 2013. The Contract Specialist will not respond to verbal request. All requests must be in writing.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries shall be sent to Liubov Kriel by email at vyh1@cdc.gov and reference solicitation number 2013-Q-15400 on the subject line.</p>

<p>Reverse Auction: The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

Recorded flight and cockpit data should be simple to periodically download for off-line analysis and archiving.
Submission Instructions.  Offerors are asked to provide at least the following information for each FDM system: 
(1) identification of the product by name or model number and an image showing the complete system;
(2) a general description of the FDM system (including all components that make up a complete system) and its operation;
(3) product specifications; and 
(4) cost of a complete FDM system including ancillary data processing hardware and software necessary for its operation and off-line data analysis.
This market survey is being conducted in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) policy section 3.2.1.2.1.  The survey will support market research obtained from multiple sources and will be utilized for informational and planning purposes.  The responses to this market survey will not be released.  Proprietary information will be protected if appropriately marked.

<a href="mailto:Lynne.C.Hoppel.1@gsfc.nasa.gov">Lynne  Hoppel</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for a six (6) month (3 months and 3 one-month options) extension to contract NNG08HX04C with the University of Alaska at Fairbanks (UAF) for the continued operation of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) for NASAs Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) pursuant to FAR 6.302-3, Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental or research capability; or expert services. Specifically, the effort will provide for the following: identify and obtain sources of SAR data, calibrate the data, process and archive the data, provide access to the data, support development and generation of new information products and services oriented to researchers utilizing the data, and provide the information products and services to a spectrum of users from fundamental and applied researchers to operational users and the general public. Satellites and airborne systems provide SAR data in various degrees of processing (from raw telemetered RADAR data to intermediate SAR data products to fully processed SAR imagery) to the SAR DAAC in support of NASA sponsored scientific applications, including oceanography, geology, glaciology, hydrology and ecology. There can be no interruption in services to the contract that expires March 31, 2013. According to FAR 6.302-3(b)(2)(ii), the use of the authority at (a)(2)(ii) is appropriate when it is necessary to: Establish or maintain an essential capability for engineering or developmental work calling for the practical application of investigative findings and theories of a scientific or technical nature. The current set of capabilities possessed by UAF are essential to NASA in that the combination of technological skills, scientific and theoretical knowledge and practical hands-on experience are necessary to operate and manage the SAR DAAC. NASA requirements include the following: 1)	Support NASAs Earth Science objectives and the broad SAR user community by providing access (e.g. discovery, search, browse and download) to SAR data and products archived at the DAAC; 2)	Provide operations support for acquiring, processing, archiving and distributing data for new and future missions; 3)	Provide operations support for ingesting, archiving and distribution of PolSAR and InSAR type products, e.g. UAVSAR and AIRSAR data processed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); 4)	Manage the needs of the DAAC users, improve the exchange of data and information between earth scientists and SAR data users, share DAAC expertise with the user community, assist in locating and manipulating related data not archived at the DAAC, and serve as a point of contact for the development and implementation of new algorithms to derive SAR data and applications products; and 5)	Provide support to the research and educational communities engaged in the use of SAR data products. 6)	The UAF facility is necessary because it is the only facility in the U.S. that meets the geographic requirements for the collection and processing of SAR data. The UAF ground station is located above Latitude 64N, allowing the greatest number of opportunities to acquire data (in terms of satellite passes) from the RADARSAT-1, RADARSAT-2, ERS-2 and ALOS polar orbiting spacecraft. A processing facility elsewhere would require the costly and technically difficult transmission of data from the ground station. As a result, this facility is the only facility that can meet the Governments requirements for the collection and processing of SAR data with low data latency. Many NASA investigations rely on the UAF ability to process and distribute data in near-real time (NRT).  In these instances, near real-time processing of SAR data often needs to occur so that products are available to scientists within six hours or less of collection at the sensor.	This imposes several time constraints in the process, including the time between collection at the sensor and overpass by the satellite of the ground station, the data downlink time, the time required to transmit large volumes of data to the processing facility and the actual time required to create SAR products.  All these steps are required to produce SAR products, but the total time required is not constant nor can it be fully characterized due to a number of factors. In order to mitigate latency risks due to data transmit times and allow NRT requirements to be met at a high percentage, co-location of processing with the downlink location is required.  Only the UAF can provide the near-real time capability because of their proximity to the antenna collecting sensor data directly and passing it into the SAR DAAC systems, which makes them uniquely qualified to perform the work. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on -February 15, 2013.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. THE	TELEPHONE NUMBERS LISTED HEREIN FOR MS. HOPPEL ARE INCORRECT.  MS. HOPPEL MAY BE REACHED AT 410-349-4699. THERE IS NO FAX.  THE EMAIL ADDRESS IS CORRECT. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<p>Description</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Biology Branch (RBB), plans to procure on a sole source basis services from Best Theratronics, 413 March Road, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, K2K 0E4, to ship a government-owned GC-220 Cobalt-60 Irradiator back to the original supplier.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 the business size standard is $19.0 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Work shall be completed within ten (10) weeks from date of award at a time to be agreed upon by the NCI RBB and Best Theratronics.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.  <br />The Radiation Biology Branch is decommissioning a GammaCell (GC)-220 cobalt irradiator (s/n 169).  The irradiator contains highly radioactive cobalt-60 and hence the shipment of the irradiator and its radioactive sources must be done by contractors who abide by strict radiation safety procedures and have been specifically trained for this procedure on these particular units. Further, the issue of security is of utmost importance given that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has identified such radiation sources as potential targets for terrorists.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all essential means for packing and preparing the GC-220 for safe shipment from the National Institute of Health, National Cancer Institute, 10 Center Drive, Building 10, Bethesda, Maryland to Nordion, 447 March Road, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, including labor, container rental, rigging, and all expenses for one factory trained service technician.  The contractor shall have NRC-issued security clearance for unescorted access to the GC-220 irradiator by the period of performance start date.  The contractor shall follow NRC guidelines for the shipping of the GC-220.<br /> <br />The Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), now named Nordion, manufactured the irradiator and still holds the original license for the cobalt-60 sources.  Based on how the irradiator was manufactured, removal of the cobalt-60 sources on-site is not possible.  The entire irradiator must be shipped to Nordion where they can be safely removed and disposed.  Best Theratronics is the only sanctioned company by Nordion to service this irradiator, and as such it is the only source that has the required expertise to ship the cobalt-60 irradiator safely back to the original company that holds the license of the radioactive material.  Further, in order for a contractor to package and remove a radioactive irradiator, the NRC must provide security clearance for unescorted access to the irradiators.  Best Theratronics is the only source that meets these requirements for service on GC-220 irradiators. <br /> <br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisition on or before 11:00 AM EST on February 19, 2013.  No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax) an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisition to the address stated above.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Laura Glockner, Contract Specialist at laura.glockner@nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) through SAM.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference solicitation number NCI-130030-LG on all correspondence.</p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Center Research (CCR), Metabolism Branch plans to procure on a sole source basis a robotic handling system from Beckman Coulter, 250 South Kraemer Blvd, Brea, CA 92822 and associated twelve month service contract.   <br /> <br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Delivery Date: February 28, 2013</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract. <br /> <br />The NCI Metabolism Branch is tasked with identifying the genetic causes of lymphomas (lymphoid cancer), and developing drugs to therapeutically treat this disease.  The Metabolism Branch is employing genomic scale RNA interference (RNAi) library screens to identify essential genes in cancer. The bacterial clones representing a genomic scale RNAi library have already been purchased.  To begin using this product in screens for therapeutic targets, the Metabolism Branch must prepare DNA from all 160,000 clones in the library. <br /> <br />The Metabolism Branch requires an automated robotic handling system consisting of multiple instruments to process the 160,000 clones of plasmid DNA that will become a resource for the CCR.  The Beckman Coulter robotic handling system will contain an automated liquid handling workstation to perform competitive DNA normalization and DNA preparation as well as an integrated absorbance plate reader to provide the detection for the quantitative data that will be used by the Metabolism Branch's existing liquid handler to automatically determine both concentration and volume to provide DNA normalization in a 96 well format.  Future on-site expansion must be able to accommodate off deck ambient storage of additional microplates as throughput requirements increase.</p>
<p>The following salient characteristics apply to the Beckman Coulter robotic handling system:</p>
<p>Liquid Handling Units<br />-  modular-based platforms designed to accommodate a variety of sample throughput in 96-, 384-, and 1536-well formats<br />-  single arm with one Span-8 head with rotating gripping unit<br />-  single arm with one 96-channel head with a gripping unit with validated chemistry for DNA preparation<br />-  96-channel multichannel head to run the validated chemistries of Beckman Coulter Agencourt CosMCPrep.  This system has pipetting accuracies of 3% CV at volumes of 1 &micro;L.  The 96 channel head is upgradeable with a 384 channel head.   <br />-  automatic tip loading and unloading achieved using pneumatic control.  The deck of each system has at least 15 positions to provide the capacity needed.<br />-  system is able to wash the disposable tips, unload and reload the same tips in order to re-use the disposable tips.  The systems are capable of adding a 96 or 384 channel active wash station with speed pump included.<br />-  liquid handling systems is able to operate as a stand alone workstation as well as with the option of fully integrated external labware storage and other devices<br />- laser light curtain allows for complete work area accessibility while still providing operator safety. The light curtain is automatically controlled and may be activated or deactivated periodically to allow external robotic access to the work deck without manual attention. The lab positioners must be raised off the deck to allow wiring and tubing to be protected below the work area this also aids in operator safety.<br />-  liquid handlers include a self-calibration system with a laser system to allow for quick and easy calibration <br />-  liquid handlers have an integrated gripper with both the 96-channel and 384-channel head that are able to move labware to and from stacker carousels and automated hotels, move labware stacks, and distribute stacked labware (up to four standard microplates) along the work deck</p>
<p>Software Control<br />-  runs on an external computer using a windows-based program.  <br />-  provides the ability to optimally transfer liquids between various microplate formats through the use of pre-defined pipetting techniques<br />- provides drag and drop commands, import/export functions, worklisting capability, advanced sample tracking capability, loop functionality, variables, if/then commands, and collapsible/expandable method reviews<br />- able to track samples in each well and allow well calculation manipulation and well sample reporting<br />- supports predefined pipetting techniques that include special low volume pipetting controls, taking into account variability of viscosity/surface tension from one reagent/solvent to another.  These pipetting techniques can be quickly and easily called upon in a pipetting method by solvent name from a list of characterized fluids.<br />-  operating system software has Simulation Software for Desktop method writing and visual viewing of the method written.  The robotic simulation provides a 360-degree view of the robot and allows for observation of the robotic execution of the method written. The software also provides the total amount of time that it will take to run the method written.</p>
<p>Microplate Detection<br />-  includes the patented multichannel optical design of the SpectraMax&reg; 190. This Absorbance Microplate Reader mimics a dual beam spectrophotometer, measures each sample in the plate directly, and eliminates measurement error due to variations in light output between optical fibers on other instruments for more reliable data reporting.<br />-  eight-channel system delivers both high precision and speed when reading 96-well microplates for endpoint measurements, kinetic assays, and spectral scans.</p>
<p>Chemistry Requirements <br />-  uses Beckman Coulter Genomics (Agencourt) SPRI methods in a fully automated format.  This fully validated method shows data and an operational facility regularly performing purifications using both the automation and SPRI Interface equipped with a quick startup menu, a deck setup walkthrough menu, a method recovery menu, and a procedure menu.<br />-  Agencourt CosMCPrep methods incorporate a simplified, graphical user interface to allow for sample plate customization.  Default settings; such as sample type, number of samples, plate dry time and elution volume; provide a general starting point for the user.</p>
<p>Beckman Coulter is the only known contractor that can provide such a robotic handling system that is compatible with the Metabolism Branch's existing robotic system.  In addition, the use of a robotic handling system from a contractor other than Beckman Coulter would void warranties of the Metabolism Branch's existing system. Therefore, Beckman Coulter is the only know contractor that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.     <br /> <br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisition on or before 11:00 AM EST on February 11, 2013.

POINT OF CONTACT:  Melissa Sanders, Contracting Officer, (melissa.sanders@navy.mil)
Phone:  (850) 230-3266

NOTE:  This BAA replaces BAA-13-G-01-MOD-01

The Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU) is soliciting pre-proposals and proposals for applied Biomedical Research and Diving Equipment Development with a focus on Submarine Escape and Rescue, Diving Safety, and Diving Effectiveness. The goals of this program are presented in more detail below.  It is the intent that this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) be open for a one year period from the date of this publication (or until 2/15/2014).
  However, specified dates are given in paragraph (2) below for submission of pre-proposals and proposals to be awarded within FY 2014.
 
(1) Primary Interests

This program's objectives are to focus on improving or developing diving equipment that can be rapidly transitioned to a fleet capability and researching the biomedical aspects of Submarine Escape, Rescue, and Diver Safety so that procedures can be developed/improved that will increase the levels of safety and effectiveness for Navy personnel.  The typical project will be two years or less although three year projects are considered.

The areas of primary interest in submarine escape and rescue are: (1) development of rapid methods of disabled submarine (DISSUB) atmosphere assessment; (2) development of novel means to manage oxygen toxicity aboard the pressurized disabled submarine; (3) development of novel means to accelerate or eliminate saturation decompression of survivors; including, but not limited to greater oxygen use and perfluorocarbon (PFC) administration; (4) assuring survival in a disabled submarine (DISSUB) for seven days by evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of present life support stores.
 Improved Guard Book guidance and procedures,  utility of medication to reduce the metabolic rate of the crew; impact of starvation, dehydration, sleep deprivation and nitrogen narcosis at 5ATA on decision making and ability to carry out Guard Book directed survival actions and escape; (5) improving understanding and guidance for thermal stress in a disabled submarine by development and evaluation of heat stress curves for time and/or conditions to escape; heat mitigation measures (body cooling) in conditions of increased temperature and elevated CO2 (2.5 - 3%); (6) improving understanding and guidance for surface interval decompression sickness (DCS) risk after saturation dropout or aborted decompression, including, but not limited to; mitigation with various periods of oxygen pre-breathing and perfluorocarbon (PFC) administration; (7) evaluating the adequacy of hypothermia protection with present available clothing in combination with SEIS suits in SEIS rafts; (8) evaluating capability to escape from depths deeper than 600 feet by updating escape procedures and equipment; identifying necessary compression rates and further escape procedure and equipment changes that are needed; including new classes of operational submarines in the analysis; (9) improving senior survivor decision tools;(10) improving care of escape and rescue casualties within the U.S.
 Navy Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System, including, but not limited to critical care and casualty assessment.

The areas of primary interest in diving equipment, safety and effectiveness are organized along five Lines of Operation (LOO).  These LOO describe the primary areas of limitations for a diver and are:  Breathing Gas Supply, Human Performance, Environmental Protection, Decompression, and Tools, Transportation and Training.  Areas of interest in each LOO are:

(I)	Breathing Gas Supply: (1) Development of High pressure air flask, hose and regulators, high pressure defined for this purpose as greater than 5,000psi; (2) Improved CO2 scrubbing material for both free-swimming and fixed systems; (3) development of portable, minimal power input, O2 concentrators capable of working in conjunction with existing diving air compressors; (4) Developing a diver-worn system to extract breathing gas from surrounding seawater; (5) Developing a diver-worn system that could utilize seawater as CO2 scrubbing medium; (6) Improved helium reclaim system to support mixed gas and saturation dive systems; (7) Improved O2 sensor for use in closed-circuit UBAs; (8) Improved Portable Air Monitor that can test for all contaminants listed in table 4-2 of the U.S.
 Dive Manual in real time.

(II)	Human Performance: (1) Improving understanding of mechanism of oxygen toxicity and development of mitigations; (2) Developing and/or refining noise protection exposure limits; (3) Refine the understanding and mitigation of hypercapnia in divers; (4) Improve understanding of nitrogen narcosis to include mitigations and predictions of equivalent narcotic depths; (5) Improve understanding of effects on human body from immersion, exertion, breathing resistance, and temperature in relation to working underwater; (6) Improving understanding of and developing guidance for the prevention of immersion pulmonary edema
(III)	Environmental Protection: (1) Diver worn heater and/or chiller; (2) Temperature control for submerged divers in a wet submersible; (3) Physical protection for diver in grossly contaminated water as well as decontamination equipment and procedures; (4) Improved understanding of heat loss/retention in the submerged body, in effort to optimize heating/cooling of diver; (5) Improved passive thermal protection for divers to include improved durability to support field/combat conditions
(IV)	Decompression: (1)  Development of new decompression models valid across the full spectrum of diving;  (2) Improved procedures for shallow nitrogen-oxygen saturation diving including downward excursion dive capability on helium-nitrogen-oxygen mixtures; (3) Pharmacological or other novel mitigations for elimination of retained nitrogen in a diver; (4) Improving diagnosis of decompression illness through, but not limited to utilization of algorithms; (5) Improving understanding of the mechanisms of isobaric counter diffusion as it effects the skin, inner ear, and deep body tissues.
 (6) Improved decompression profiles based on the use of alternate gas mixtures, to include but not limited to Trimix. 
(V)	Tools, Transportation and Training: (1) Electronic recording and archiving of operational dive profiles to develop an operational dive data base; (2)  Develop a Transportable Recompression Chamber System (TRCS) replacement of similar or smaller dimensional size and functionality, using advance materials (i.e. carbon fiber, or other lightweight material) to reduce overall system weight for easier transport in military and commercial aircraft; (3) Improved diver communications, both wired and through-water; (4) Ability to track divers location underwater from surface support craft; (5) Through water data communication for divers (text, navigation, biometrics); (6) Improved diver propulsion devices to include diver worn and diver as passenger; (7) Decompression dive computer with flexibility to support multiple dives and varying breathing gas mixes; (8) Heads Up Display (HUD) for divers, both free-swimming and surface-supplied.
  HUD need not be limited to life support data (text, navigation, diagrams/schematics for projects, etc); (9) Low visibility vision enhancement for diver.

(2) Instructions for Preparation of Pre-proposal and Proposals

For FY14, the deadline for submission of pre-proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 30 March 2013 for the funding cycle that begins 1 October 2013, and the deadline for submission of full technical proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 4 June 2013.  Proposals received after the due date will be considered only if funds remain available.
The format for pre-proposals and proposals may be obtained from the Program Assistant, at 850-230-3205 or E-mail: w_PNMA_nedu_BAAInbox The pre-proposal should be three to five pages of text and should include an estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for each year of the proposed effort.
  A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) should be appended together with any supporting information, such as reprints or preprints, which will assist in the evaluation of the pre-proposal. 
Offerors submitting the most promising pre-proposals will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their pre-proposal submission.  However, any such invitation does not obligate the Government to make an award.  Offerors are also advised all awards are subject to the DCAA contract audit process.  Any offeror may submit a full technical proposal even if its pre-proposal was not identified as promising or if no pre-proposal is submitted; however any full proposal submission would be made without the benefit of feedback prior to full proposal submission.
  A completed animal use protocol with supporting documentation is required before award when animals are employed. (Ref. SECNAVINST 3900.38C)  Any proposal that involves the experimental use of human subjects must include a separate evaluation of proposed technical approaches and associated risks by the contractor's committee for protection of human subjects. Before award, required documentation includes DoD Assurance, IRB approved Consent or waiver of documentation of informed consent, IRB approved protocol, documentation that the submitter/PI completed Human Research Protections Training, and a policy statement indicating that the institution will comply with the 32 CFR 219, DoDINST 3216.02, the SECNAVINST 3900.39 series, and all applicable sections of the 21 CFR.
  Offerors must state in their pre-proposals and full proposals that it is submitted in response to this BAA.  This BAA provides no funding for pre-proposals or subsequent proposal development purposes.  All pre-proposals will be acknowledged. Proposals will not be returned after evaluation. 

(3) Criteria for Selecting Proposals, their Relative Importance, and the Method of Evaluation

Pre-proposal and full technical proposal submissions will be evaluated on (1) the overall basis of innovation and scientific merit; (2) the relevance to submarine escape, rescue, and diving; (3) the overall value and affordability of the proposal; and (4) the offeror's capabilities, strengths and weaknesses or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.
  The Government reserves the right to select for funding any, all, part or none of the responses received.  For efforts funded as contracts, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities.  This is to notify potential offerors that each contract that may be placed under this announcement, or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause: "As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) an entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students.
 If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative payments unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award.  "If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any contract, including any existing contract, (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a contract or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation."  See instructions above for pre-proposals and proposals.
  The Government's preference is to award definitive contracts under this BAA.  However, an award can be made via grant at the sole discretion of the Government. 
All responsive sources may submit proposals that will be considered by NEDU.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals or join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete and severable areas of submarine escape, rescue, and diving for exclusive competition among these entities.  This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d) (2) (i).
  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Questions regarding this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist identified herein.  Technical content questions should be addressed to CAPT Ken Eisenberg, Deep Submergence Biomedical Development Program Manager, (202) 781-4921.

This is to notify potential offerors that each contract that may be placed under this announcement, or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause: "As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) an entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students.
 If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative payments unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award.  "If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any contract, including any existing contract, (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a contract or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation."  See instructions above for pre-proposals and proposals.
  The Government's preference is to award definitive contracts under this BAA.  However, an award can be made via grant at the sole discretion of the Government. 
All responsive sources may submit proposals that will be considered by NEDU.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals or join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete and severable areas of submarine escape, rescue, and diving for exclusive competition among these entities.  This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d) (2) (i).
  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Questions regarding this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist identified herein.  Technical content questions should be addressed to CAPT Ken Eisenberg, Deep Submergence Biomedical Development Program Manager, (202) 781-4921.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requires
Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to
support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously
approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures
listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required
to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific intends a sole source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite- Quantity contract, to Technology Unlimited Group (TUG), 3252 Rosecrans Street, San Diego, CA 92110, a Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concern.  The contract is a follow-on to N66001-08-D-0047, which was the result of a sole source to TUG, for Communications Data Link System (CDLS), Common High Bandwidth Data Link (CHBDL), and Video Interface Group (VIG) software development and support, and the supporting equipment including the Command and Control Processor (CCP). This requirement is for the support for systems engineering and integration, software development and maintenance, test and evaluation and program support services for existing and future Navy Advanced Wideband Communications systems such as Common Data Link (COL). This also includes support for the CCP and VIG.
The purpose of this effort is to protect and accelerate information transfer within and between the various Navy CDL and Navy wideband communications systems for all U.S. and allied Services.  This includes developing, migrating, integrating, and maintaining new technology for advances in communications and surveillance.  This also includes integration of advanced concepts into formats compatible with the Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) the Combat Systems Product Line Architecture (CS-PLA) and/or the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) architectures.
The use of any other source for this acquisition would result in the duplication of cost and time to develop the middleware replacement software prior to performing any required software maintenance and/or upgrades associated with lengthy and expensive familiarization period and a rigorous bank of security reviews and tests of the software that is not expected to be recovered through competition. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes. A solicitation will not be posted. A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Authority For other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. TUG's technology makes it the only source that would not result in the duplication of cost. Because of the short-term need for the TUG procurement, the added cost would not be recovered through competition. The anticipated period of performance will be approximately 3 years with an estimated value of $2.99 million. Questions concerning this sole source contract action may be directed to Kirina L. Cantre at kirina.cantre@navy.mil.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION PROVIDE AND INSTALL/DELIVER CONTAINER(S) FOR SCRAP METAL STORAGE
This is a request for information for acquisition planning purposes.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of potential contractors to meet the needs of the Government.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.  
This is not a request for proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this request for information.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice.
The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region has a requirement to prevent potentially contaminated scrap metal in a storage area from contacting the earth by use of an environmental containment area. 
Scrap metal is currently being stored in an area cordoned off by Jersey barriers on three sides, with a fourth side available for access by truck, crane, fork-lift, or other vehicles to load or unload scrap metal. The dimensions of the current storage area are 46' by 37'. The stored scrap metal is in multiple pieces that are not uniform, ranging in weight from less than one pound, to 15 tons. Each scrap metal piece may range in length from less than one foot to 15 feet. Vendors considering leasing equipment should be aware that scrap metal to be loaded into the container(s) is not uniform in size or cut, and is not treated. Therefore, the container provided may experience normal wear and tear including, but not limited to dents, scrapes, scratches, or delamination. 
Potential ways to meet our requirement include the building of a concrete or metal pad, approximately 46' by 37', with a small lip, approximately 1", to prevent contaminates from contacting the earth, or by providing a dumpster/container that is able to be driven into by a truck or fork-lift. The maximum height of any potential solution shall be 7.5 feet. The ability to drive a fork-lift into the storage area is a firm requirement. Preventing contaminates from contacting the ground is a firm requirement. 
The potential future solicitation will schedule a date for a site visit for vendors to inspect the site prior to submittal of proposals. 
Interested vendors are invited to submit capability packages describing the products/services they provide related to providing and installing the containers described above. Packages should include the following information:  
(1)	Provide business name, address, business size and socio-economic type (8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, Small Business, Large Business, etc.), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number. (2)	Submit capability information, such as similar projects performed, dollar value of similar projects, photographs, and customer contact information. (3)	Submit product/service information, including pictures, sizes, estimated cost, and proposed delivery/installation times.

Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. <br /><br /><strong>Background.</strong> This procurement is entitled Mission Support Services for Preparation of Toxicological Profiles and Associated Documents. Profiles are developed in response to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 which amended the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA or Superfund). Under the authority of Section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) Section 104, as amended by Section 110 (P.L. 99 499) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are required to establish guidelines for the development of toxicological profiles. The development of toxicological profiles and other scientific documents continue to support federal, state and local health professionals, public health assessors, and numerous groups and individuals in understanding the potential for human exposure to various hazardous substances. Profiles are required to be released by October 17 of each year.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives.</strong> The purpose of this procurement is to support ATSDR in the preparation of profiles and associated documents on hazardous substances found at facilities on the EPA National Priorities List. Substances for profile development are selected from the ATSDR Substance Priority List (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/spl/index.html). Other substances not on the list may also be selected based on the public health needs as determined by ATSDR. Support provided under this procurement may include coordination of the production of the profile, as well as analysis, consultation, support concerning projects directly related to the development of the profiles and significant human exposure levels (SHELs) or Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) and other scientific documents.<br /><br />The profile must also focus on important data needs that preclude the determination of significant levels of human exposure or contribute substantially to the uncertainty of such levels. The quality of such data must be assessed and in order to support the determination of levels of significant human exposure and, where major gaps in the supporting data exist, identify those data needs in the toxicological profiles.
<p>Under Section 104 of CERCLA as amended by Section 110 of SARA, the toxicological profiles must contain, at a minimum, the following information:<br />An examination, summary, and interpretation of available toxicological information and epidemiologic evaluations on a hazardous substance in order to ascertain the levels of significant human exposure for the substance and the associated acute, subchronic, and chronic health effects.<br />A determination of whether adequate information on the health effects of each substance is available or in the process of development to determine levels of exposure which present a significant risk to human health of acute, subchronic, and chronic health effects.<br /><br />Where appropriate, an identification of toxicological testing needed to identify the types or levels of exposure that may present significant risk of adverse health effects in humans.<br />Under the provisions of CERCLA, Section 104 as amended by SARA, Section 110, ATSDR has sole responsibility for the development and publication of all toxicological profiles and will sponsor the work and serve as project oversight. In addition, the profile will undergo an independent peer review and be made available in draft form to the public for comment. ATSDR will be referred to as the Government in the work requirements.<br />Project requirements. <br /><br /><strong>Scope of Work -</strong> <br />1.

<p>Installation Description</p>
<p>Schriever Air Force Base (SAFB) is located approximately 13 miles east of downtown Colorado Springs, Colorado and approximately eight miles east of Peterson AFB, in El Paso County, Colorado. The area surrounding SAFB is rural; the nearest community is the village of Ellicott, also located in El Paso County, approximately five miles west of the base. SAFB is comprised of 3,840 acres, of which 640 acres are developed for mission use. About half (estimated as 320 acres) of the developed land is in the controlled-access restricted area (RA). Schriever AFB does not include an airfield, or buildings designated for community services. Military-Family housing is privatized, and other housing needs are met using facilities at Peterson AFB and the Air Force Academy. SAFB employs approximately 7,500 personnel. The Base is developing industrial, administrative and community/commercial areas outside the Restricted Area, with a warehouse currently under construction in the planned industrial area. There are about 2,000 acres of land available for development at SAFB, constrained by the mission requirements and environmental concerns. Additional construction has been delayed until 2017 due to USAF construction budget constraints.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a high resolution atomic force microscope (AFM).
<p><br />An AFM is a surface characterization tool that uses a nanometer scale probe tip to scan the surface of a material to measure surface topology at the nanoscale. AFMs are also used to measure bulk properties such as hardness, conductivity, magnetic, and thermal-mechanical. The AFM is a very high-resolution microscopy tool, with demonstrated resolution on the order of fractions of a nanometer, more than 1000 times better than the optical diffraction limit. In addition, the AFM is a nondestructive measurement technique that can provide direct critical measurement data on nanoscale devices during the fabrication process. The AFM is an essential tool to NanoFab users and there is an increasing demand for more AFM capacity, improved measurement resolution and improved ability to adapt the AFM hardware and programming to the needs of researchers. NIST has a need for a high resolution AFM with improved capability, adaptability, and programming flexibility.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the high resolution AFM, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a purchase order.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a large sample, wafer scale (200 mm) Atomic Force Microscope/Scanning Probe Microscope (AFM/SPM).
<p><br />Due to increasing demand for wafer-scale characterization in the CNST NanoFab, NIST has a need for an AFM/SPM that has the capability to perform non-destructive, nanoscale surface topography and related measurements at several sites across a 200 mm-diameter wafer as rapidly as possible. (The maximum probe velocity is expected to be a key evaluation factor in the procurement.)</p>
<p>The wafer scale AFM/SPM will be sited in a class 100 cleanroom and it will be used as a shared resource in the CNST NanoFab, accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies. Users will range in experience from AFM/SPM novices to experts in the field. The wafer scale AFM/SPM will be utilized to investigate a wide range of materials and nanostructures. High-resolution, high speed imaging and analysis of surface topography and other surface properties will be required.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the wafer scale AFM/SPM, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a purchase order.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE. The Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst is requesting information pertaining to the replacement of the existing A/S32A-32 (Spotting Dolly, SD-2). The USN currently uses the SD-2 for aircraft movement in the tight confines of shipboard hangar bays. For the purposes of this RFI, the new item will be called Shipboard Aircraft Handler (A/S32A-50). The SAH will be required to operate on CVNs, LHDs and LHA-6 class ships and will be required to maneuver and park/spot the following aircraft in the hangar bay: AV-8B, C-2A, CH-53E/K, MH-53E, CH-46D/E, E/A-6B, EA-18G, E-2C/D, F/A-18A/B/C/D/E/F, F-35B/C, MV-22 and UCAV-N/D.
<p>The current SD-2 accomplishes this by engaging the aircraft nose/tail gear, lifting it off the deck and utilizing its zero turning radius to maneuver/rotate about the nose/tail gear while pushing or towing. The SAH must be configured to allow the vehicle to pass under the aircraft to access the nose/tail wheel and to pass under parked aircraft to traverse a packed hangar bay. It must be able to tow all the above aircraft around the hangar bay and onto the ships elevator. The Government is requesting information on the availability of a tethered remote controlled, diesel electric powered vehicle.</p>
<p>Nominal preliminary requirements for the SAH are: <br />1. Dead man type operator controls. <br />2. Zero turning radius about the center of the vehicle/aircraft engagement point.<br />3. Attachment mechanism that prevents disengagement of the nose/tail gear when raised off the deck. <br />4. Capable of lowering the nose/tail gear and disengaging from it without contacting any surface of the aircraft at angles up to 90 degrees to port or starboard with respect to the aircraft's centerline.<br />5. No wider than 81 inches, no higher than 29 inches, have a ground clearance of 3.5 inches and have a minimum approach/departure angle of 10 degrees. <br />6.

The ability to stop when loaded within 2 feet from a speed of 3 MPH.<br />12. Operation of the unit should be accomplished by a tethered remote control so the operator is safely away from the aircraft.</p>
<p>As required for any typical Navy Support Equipment (SE), the SAH shall be highly reliable, easily maintainable and supportable. The SAH shall be capable of meeting shipboard vibration, shock (MIL-S-901 Grade A), environmental, EMI and mobility criteria. Human factors engineering shall be utilized to the greatest extent possible to make the SAH a "user friendly" piece of Support Equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of the request for information is to identify potential contractors and to gain insight into current commercial or military products. Along with the interest and product information, it is requested that following topics be addressed:</p>
<p>1. Advantages/disadvantages of a diesel electric generator driving a hydraulic system or an electric system.<br />2. Integrated Logistics as part of the design process.<br />3. Operational environment of similar, current products.<br />4. Design process including the use of modeling, drawing practices, etc.<br />5. Experience with aircraft handling equipment.<br />6. Estimate of delivery times for long lead components.<br />7. Estimated price information for production units.<br />8. Estimate of time to design the item - the number of months from contract award to Critical Design Review (CDR). A frozen design and complete drawing package are key elements of the CDR. <br />9. Estimate of time to build 5 units for testing - the number of months from CDR to start of the test program. Parts procurement and assembly starts at CDR approval.<br />10. Estimate of production delivery rate (number of units/month).<br />11. Design features that should be considered for potential inclusion in the performance specification.</p>
<p>The government may host an Industry Day in the April/May 2013 timeframe on board a CVN. The purpose would be to familiarize potential procurement sources with the operating environment of the SAH onboard a CVN. Any updates regarding the Industry Day will be posted under this announcement.</p>
<p>It is requested that information be submitted NO LATER THAN 18 March 2013 to Ms. Gianna Gatto, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25212 B562-3, Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082, or by electronic mail at: gianna.gatto@navy.mil.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) <br />Experimental Forward Operating Base (ExFOB) 2013-1 - Hybrid Power Systems
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes an RFI notice for planning purposes.</p>
<p>The next Experimental Forward Operating Base demonstration (ExFOB 2013-1) will be held at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) Twentynine Palms, California, from 6 through 10 May 2013. The focus of ExFOB 2013-1 is hybrid power systems that could enhance combat effectiveness and reduce logistics support of Patrol Bases (PBs) and Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). The due date for responses to this RFI is midnight on 1 March 2013.</p>
<p>GENERAL ExFOB BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Created by the Commandant in 2009, the ExFOB brings together stakeholders from across the Marine Corps requirements, acquisition, and technology development communities in a dynamic process to quickly evaluate and deploy technologies that reduce our need for "liquid logistics" today, and to establish requirements for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Industry is invited to ExFOB to demonstrate off-the-shelf technologies with potential to address current Marine Corps capability gaps. Promising technologies are then put into the hands of Marines for extended user evaluation under combat and/or training conditions. User evaluation results inform requirements development and may ultimately lead to procurement and fielding of systems that close these gaps, resulting in a more combat-effective fighting force.</p>
<p>Over the last three years, the ExFOB Team has:<br />&bull; Conducted 5 demonstrations at Marine Corps bases across the country<br />&bull; Reviewed 280+ RFI submissions and evaluated 75+ technologies at ExFOB <br />&bull; Purchased and deployed 11 different technologies to Afghanistan <br />&bull; Transitioned 4 Technologies to Programs of Record</p>
<p>HYBRID POWER SYSTEMS:</p>
<p>The focus of ExFOB 2013-1 is hybrid power systems. The Marine Corps' hybrid power needs can be divided into four categories, each with different power demands, attributes, and transport requirements: MEHPS Lightweight, MEHPS Medium, MEHPS Micro-Grid Medium, and MEHPS Micro-Grid Heavy. The power demands, attributes, and transport requirements of each of the four categories of systems are listed below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peak Power Attributes Transport Requirements <br />MEHPS Lightweight 3 kW -Auto-control of single generator<br />-Energy storage -Solar Each component does not exceed four man lift<br />MEHPS Medium 10 kW -Auto-control of single generator -Energy storage -Solar All components on LTT<br />MEHPS Micro-Grid Medium 60 kW -Auto-control of multiple generators -Energy storage<br />Controls and energy storage on LTT<br />MEPHS Micro-Grid Heavy 300 kW -Auto-control of multiple generators</p>
<p>Forklift-able</p>
<p>The objective of ExFOB 2013-1 is to increase the Marine Corps' knowledge of the state of current commercial hybrid systems and the technological challenges that may be associated with moving these commercial technologies to viable military capabilities i.e. size, weight, durability, etc., within each of these four categories. ExFOB 2013-1 follows the recently completed Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for Mobile Electric Hybrid Power Source (MEHPS). The AoA provides preliminary analysis concerning the power demands, attributes, and transport requirements of each of the four categories of systems. As part of this analysis, USMC utilized a micropower optimization modeling tool to measure the performance and fuel reduction capability of simulated systems within these categories versus USMC program of record gear at specific power demand profiles. The results of the AoA were presented at the MEHPS Brief to Industry held on 31 January 2013 at Marine Corps Base Quantico. The presentation from that event is available at www.fbo.gov and www.hqmc.marines.mil/e2o.</p>
<p>At ExFOB 2013-1, the USMC will move beyond modeling to look at actual system performance in an austere environment. During the week-long event, ExFOB personnel will meter and monitor the performance of each hybrid system operating in USMC-specific power demand profiles developed during the AoA. Please refer to the proposed Evaluation Concept (included as EXHIBIT A) for additional information. In addition to quantitative data collection, active duty Marines will provide qualitative feedback on each system.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC SYSTEMS OF INTEREST FOR ExFOB 2013-1:</p>
<p>MEHPS Lightweight-A modular system for meeting power demand up to 3kW. The system should auto-control a single generator, utilize energy storage, and harvest solar energy. Each component should have a transport burden no greater than "four man lift".</p>
<p>MEHPS Medium-A mobile system well suited to meet peak power demands between 3 and 10 kW. The system should auto-control a single generator, utilize energy storage, and harvest solar energy. It is not mandatory that the system be on a trailer, however, the collective components should not drastically exceed the weight and cube of a typical LTT payload.</p>
<p>MEHPS Micro-Grid Medium-A mobile system well suited to meet peak power demands up to and including 60 kW. The system should auto-control multiple generators and utilize energy storage. It is not mandatory that the system be on a trailer, however, the collective components should not drastically exceed the weight and cube of a typical LTT payload.</p>
<p>MEHPS Micro-Grid Heavy-Due to space and equipment constraints, systems of this scale will not be considered for participation in ExFOB 2013-1. A future ExFOB may focus on this category.</p>
<p>**NOTE: The ExFOB Team will not provide USMC generators for use by participants. Participants must bring their own generators to ExFOB 2013-1. Civilian (commercial) generators are acceptable.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION PROCESS AND DUE DATE:</p>
<p>The ExFOB Team has partnered with the U.S. Army's joint ground systems Enterprise Market Investigation Process (EMIP) to manage the ExFOB 2013-1 RFI process. To respond to this RFI, please complete an EMIP Technology Application Idea Submission Form (a "Sample" form is included as EXHIBIT B) and send via e-mail to: usarmy.detroit.peo-cs-css.mbx.truck-tech@mail.mil with cc to energy@usmc.mil. Please do not attach marketing brochures, test reports, or other extraneous materials to your Submission Form as they will not be reviewed. The due date for responses to this RFI is midnight on 1 March 2013.</p>
<p>If your technology is of interest, the ExFOB Team will contact you with an invitation to participate in ExFOB 2013-1 at MCAGCC Twentynine Palms, California, from 6 through 10 May 2013.</p>
<p>NOTE: This RFI is issued for the purpose of determining market capability of sources and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB), a Request for Proposal (RFP), a Request for Quote (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice. No solicitation document exists at this time. All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses may not include Classified material. Responses to this notice will not be returned. No reimbursement will be made for any costs to provide information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. Information contained herein is based on the best information available at the time for publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding upon the Government. <br />&emsp;<br />EXHIBIT A: ExFOB 2013-1 Hybrid Power Systems Evaluation Concept<br />Overview<br />Using the three Hybrid Power Systems categories defined in the RFI (MEHPS Lightweight and MEHPS Medium and MEHPS Micro-Grid Medium), the ExFOB technical team will evaluate each system's performance and fuel reduction capability against its corresponding Program of Record (PoR) power generation equipment using USMC-specific load profiles. Given the wide power ranges, and the current PoR gear utilized in those ranges, there may be multiple load profiles in each category (i.e. 30kW and 60kW TQGs are both used in the MEHPS Micro-Grid Medium category). Evaluation over the four days will provide a level of endurance and fuel consumption data for each system. All load profiles are defined in the corresponding category sections below.</p>
<p>Vendors are expected to arrive early enough to allow time for the government evaluation team to outfit the systems with data collection equipment. Vendors must also have the system fully integrated and operational prior to the "data collection dry run" Sunday afternoon May 5th. The official evaluation event kicks off the following morning, Monday May 6th. It is anticipated that all system evaluations will be conducted during normal business hours, although the possibility of 24-hour evaluation remains. Please see Table 1 for the notional ExFOB 2013-1 event timeline. Note that Thursday May 9th is an "Open Day" which vendors can use to demonstrate additional capabilities, or to repeat evaluations if necessary. <br />Table 1. Notional Daily ExFOB 2013-1 Schedule<br />Friday May 3rd Vendor Setup <br />Saturday May 4th Vendor Setup<br />Sunday May 5th Vendor Setup <br />3PM: A data collection dry run will verify the data collection equipment and connections. All vendors must have worked with the evaluation team to integrate data collection gear and completed setup.<br />Monday May 6th Profile defined by category (i.e. constant or seasonal)<br />Tuesday May 7th Profile defined by category (i.e. constant or seasonal)<br />Wednesday May 8th Profile defined by category (i.e. constant or seasonal)<br />Thursday May 9th Open Day. Useful for vendor requested demonstrations or to repeat evaluations if necessary. <br />Friday May 10th 12 noon: Retrograde</p>
<p>MEHPS Lightweight (3kW Peak)<br />3kW Evaluation Concept<br />Hybrid systems with peak power levels of 3kW will be evaluated based on the actual 24 hour profile found in Figure 1. During the event the load will be simplified to a constant power of 1.2kW with intermittent 2.3kW pulses (minutes in length) to simulate transient loads such as coffee pots and microwaves. <br /><br />Figure 1. 3kW ExFOB 2013-1 load profiles<br />MEHPS Medium (10kW Peak)<br />5kW Evaluation Concept<br />Hybrid systems with peak power levels of 5kW will be evaluated based on the actual 24 hour profile found in Figure 2. This profile will also be simplified to a constant power baseline of 2.2kW with intermittent 4.5kW pulses (minutes in length) over the course of the day.</p>
<p><br />Figure 2. 5kW ExFOB 2013-1 load profiles<br />10kW Evaluation Concept<br />At peak power levels 10kW and above environmental control units (ECUs) constitute a large portion of the energy requirement and overall demand is largely dependent on season. Figure 3 displays the three seasonal demand profiles that will be utilized; summer, winter and a combined spring/fall profile. Each seasonal curve is divided into 24 one-hour steps. During the event each one-hour time step may be compressed into 20 or 30 minute increments to simulate the 24 hour profile in an 8 or 12 hour evaluation day. Please note that Table 2 specifies which seasonal profile will be evaluated each day.</p>
<p><br />Figure 3. 10 kW ExFOB 2013-1 seasonal load profile<br />Table 2. MEHPS Micro-Grid Medium Demonstration Schedule<br />Monday May 6th Spring/Fall Profile <br />Tuesday May 7th Summer Profile <br />Wednesday May 8th Winter Profile <br />Thursday May 9th Open Day. Useful for vendor requested demonstrations or to repeat evaluations if necessary.</p>
<p>MEHPS Micro-Grid Medium (60kw Peak)<br />30kW and 60kW Evaluation Concept<br />Hybrid systems with peak power levels of 30kW and 60kW will power one of the load profiles found below, in Figure 4, based on the 30kW and 60kW PoR TQGs. At these higher power levels ECUs drive a large portion of the energy demand and therefore, three seasonal demand profiles will be used; summer, winter and a combined spring/fall profile. The shape of the seasonal curves is the same for both power levels and each is divided into 24 one-hour steps. Each load profile one-hour time step may be compressed into 20 or 30 minute increments to simulate the 24 hour profile in an 8 or 12 hour evaluation day. Please see Table 2, above, for specifics on which profile will be evaluated on which day.</p>
<p><br /><br />Figure 4. 30kW (left) and 60kW (right) ExFOB 2013-1 seasonal load profiles<br />Data Collection Concept<br />Targeted Quantitative Data<br />Data collection equipment will be provided by the government evaluation team and individual plans will be developed with each vendor to determine the best way to integrate data collection equipment. Data gathered by the government evaluation team for each system will be available for review by the respective vendors to ensure each system is operating as expected. Data gathered throughout the event for each vendor will be available to ONLY that vendor.</p>
<p>The evaluation team will use a data collection system to continuously monitor and log (at a slow data rate) overall function as well as spot-check measurements for confirmation. Data to be measured includes, but is not limited to: <br />&bull; AC current via clamp-on meters (continuously monitored)<br />&bull; AC voltages (spot checked, not monitored continuously)<br />&bull; Power factor (spot checked, not monitored continuously)<br />&bull; DC currents via in-line shunts (will require cutting cables, continuously monitored)<br />&bull; DC voltages (continuously monitored) <br />&bull; Generator runtimes and fuel consumption (logged daily)</p>
<p>In addition to the system mentioned above, a secondary data collection system will be used to more accurately characterize the three phase power behavior of up to eight (8) generators at a time. These eight measurements may be used for different systems on different days. Each of the eight generators or outputs will have high speed AC current, AC voltage, and power factor measurements logged.</p>
<p>Targeted Qualitative Data<br />Marines from the utilities, engineering, and logistics communities will interview each vendor and evaluate the state of each system as it pertains to areas such as training requirements, maintenance, reliability, supportability, transportability, etc.</p>
<p>Vendor Responsibilities<br />Vendors responding to the RFI will be responsible for providing an entire system, including commercial generators (must be permitted in CA) and load banks or loading concepts capable of simulating the provided load profiles.</p>
<p>Vendors selected for the event must also have their systems fully operational and integrated with the government evaluation team prior to the start of the data collection dry run on Sunday May 5th.</p>

<p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS)<br />United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)<br />Document Production Division (DPD)<br />Maintenance of the Card Personalization System Technology Refreshment (CPSTR)</p>
<p>General Information<br />Document Type: Sources Sought Notice (SSN)<br />Solicitation No.: HSSCCG-13-I-00002<br />Posted Date: February, 01, 2013<br />Response Date: February 15, 2013<br /><br />NAICS Code: 811219 -- Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance</p>
<p>1. PURPOSE<br />This SSN is for informational and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a solicitation or a commitment to issue a solicitation. It is issued for the purpose of notifying industry of USCIS intent to solicit and award a sole source contract to GDIT for hardware and software maintenance services described below. If potential industry participants have the capability and capacity to provide the services described below and are interested in participating in this acquisition action, please respond no later than February 15, 2013 in accordance with paragraph 4 below.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND <br />USCIS Document Production Division(DPD) requires maintenance of the Card Personalization System Technology Refreshment (CPSTR) system which produces USCIS Permanent Resident Cards (PRC) and Employment Authorization Document (EAD) cards. Currently this system is operating and being maintained at the USCIS Corbin Production Facility (CPF) in Corbin Kentucky.</p>
<p>CPSTR is a complex card identification system to receive data, personalize and issue cards, and provide systems feedback regarding completion and mailing of cards. The CPSTR system is made up of a combination of custom-developed machines, software and some commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) systems. CPSTR uses an Oracle-based CPSTR server to control data flow into and out of the CPSTR architecture. The server is GFE but programmed/configured by the current contractor. The CPSTR includes data processing, laser etching and robotic technologies, all of which must be properly maintained and repaired in order to reliably produce millions of cards per year which provide proof of immigration status and benefits for millions of people. The maintenance must be regularly performed with corrective action taken immediately in order to reliably produce millions of cards per year which provide proof of immigration status and benefits for millions of people. Without consistent, corrective maintenance the system would become unreliable, vulnerable to failure, and eventually incapable of producing cards. The maintenance must be regularly performed with corrective action taken immediately in order to ensure the CPSTR system is capable of 100% accuracy with the capability of being available to meet production requirements up to 20 hours/day, 6 days/week and 50 weeks/year to produce 120 - 300 cards per hour (depending on card type) and addressing envelope inserts with the correct card recipient address information at a rate of up to 1200 cards per hour.</p>
<p><br />3.Requirement</p>
<p>The requirement for maintenance of the existing equipment includes the following:</p>
<p>a)Hardware Maintenance and Repair Service: <br />Hardware maintenance, repair service support, and system specific spare parts for all CPSTR workstations and components to ensure the system remains fully functional at current operational production rates through the system lifecycle.</p>
<p>b)Software Maintenance Support: <br />CPSTR software maintenance support which includes any and all updates to the CPSTR systems, USCIS directed system security patching and hardening and associated testing, documentation that supports the software release updates for all system changes to ensure that the systems can be operated without disruption to other USCIS information systems.</p>
<p>c)CPSTR Software Release and Upgrade Support: <br />Support new CPSTR software releases (including upgrades to or new data tables), and any associated software security hardening, and C&amp;A testing. This would include upgrades to system software based on changes to the USCIS information systems and supporting the Systems Engineering Life-cycle (SELC) process to include providing all required documentation to accommodate system changes that impact card production operations. This would include the conversion of existing CPSTR documentation in Information Technology Life-cycle Management (ITLM) formats to SELC formats as required.</p>
<p>d)Technical Support: <br />Technical support in the area of continuing USCIS CPSTR operations to include, all Section 508 test requirements, and all SELC system documentation and testing. Technical support includes consulting for the Program Office and any required collaboration with other Contractors support DPD.</p>
<p>e)Creation of Reports: <br />Development of Oracle queries or Structured Query Language (SQL) code for the creation of customized reports, ad hoc reports, and reports by specific card type or recipient which would pull the data from the CPSTR database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS
Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) intends to award a sole-source contract to Telonics Inc., in Messa, AZ, to provide New Platform Terminal Satellite Transmitters (PTTs). which are to be attached (implantable) to several bird species for tracking across marine landscapes. The tags weigh 42g, and have transmitting duration of 1,400 hours. All PTTs must contain software to support multiple duty cycles in a calendar year format.
Telonics Inc. PTTs have been reported as having a high reliability based on field experiments with similar diving marine bird species, a light weight for the number of hours of transmission time that the units provide, and can be configured for both of the attachment methods required for the data needed.
Classification System (NAICS) code for action is 334511 Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing. This is not a solicitation for quotations, but rather a notice of the Agency's intent to make a sole-source award to Telonics Inc. There will be no solicitation issued or available. This notice if for information only.

Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because: This special notice is issued as a single source request for 3500 gallons of Jet A Fuel for Polar Bear capture helicopter North of Kivalina on the Chukchi Sea coastline between March 11 through May 10, 2013. There is no airstrip located at the port site and no other aircraft operate at the port during this time period.  Thus, the fuel used from the tank is used solely by the Fish and Wildlife Service.  The tank is filled from a larger tank that is located at the inland mine site and transported by road to the port site.   Teckcominco Alaska, Inc transports fuel via truck from their mine site along a local road that they maintain to the port site tank. Red Dog mine and port site are owned and operated by Teckcominco Alaska Incorporated. There is no airstrip at the port site thus fuel can only be transported to the site via barge, helicopter, or the road between the mine and the port.  In addition, we would have to coordinate the use of any outside suppliers with Teckcominco Alaska who owns and operates the port site.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement to continue Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of the WVU Facility that houses the GSFC NASA Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Program located in Fairmont, WV (NASA IV&V Facility). NASA GSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the continued O&M Support to West Virginia University Research Corporation (WVURC).	WVURC will provide support necessary to operate and maintain the NASA IV&V facilities which includes administration/project management, institutional services, physical security, information technology, facilities maintenance, groundskeeping and janitorial services. This procurement action is being conducted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as cited under FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, and no other supplies or services will satisfy NASA Agency requirements.  NASA and the WVURC in the early 1990s partnered to build the NASA IV&V Facility in Fairmont, West Virginia.  The IV&V facility was constructed by WVURC under a NASA grant, and title of the completed facility was transferred to WVURC in 1993. After construction, a Memorandum of Understanding was established between NASA and the West Virginia University agreeing that WVURC would provide the building to NASA for NASAs use but would be responsible for the development and daily operation of the facility.  Follow-on agreements were established between NASA and WVURC to continue to provide operation and maintenance (O&M) services to the facility for NASA.  In support of this activity, NASA has awarded contracts to WVURC for the operation and maintenance of the facility in support of the NASA activities since the original occupation of the building in 1993.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. eastern time on February 18, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<RESPDATE>021513
<CONTACT>Patrick P Barbour, Phone 919-541-7596, Email barbourp@niehs.nih.gov
<DESC>Request for Information<br />"Targeted Testing Using In vitro or Lower Phylogenetic Organism"
<p>"This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes."</p>
<p>a. Background</p>
<p>In its 2004 Roadmap for the 21st Century (http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/future), the NTP established as one of its goals the development of a high throughput/high content screening program using assays that have been demonstrated to be reliable and relevant for estimation of toxicity. In addressing this goal, NTP/NIEHS entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 2008 with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to collaborate in a research enterprise (Tox21) to develop, validate, and translate innovative chemical testing methods that characterize toxicity pathways. This MOU was expanded in 2010 to include the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In support of this collaborative effort, the NTP needs to screen chemicals and complex mixtures for biological activity relevant to toxicity pathways using in vitro assays (biochemical, cell-based, or 3D tissue constructs) and/or in vivo platforms that use lower phylogenetic organisms. The breadth of assays envisioned as potentially useful is extensive. The cost to establish and maintain a wide variety of such assays at NIEHS for the relatively small number of chemicals that might be identified for periodic screening throughout the fiscal year would be excessive. Therefore, the NTP has identified the need to establish a contract with a single organization that would be able to screen, or have screened, relatively small numbers of chemicals/mixtures using existing, commercial-off-the-shelf or modified commercial-off-the-shelf assays to be identified based on the evolving needs of the NTP Program. It is not the intent of this effort to develop and/or validate new assays. Results from these assays will be used to prioritize chemicals/mixtures of interest for more extensive toxicological characterization. This contract is independent of, but the assays selected may overlap with the assays/platforms conducted in support of the EPA's ToxCast Program (http://epa.gov/ncct/toxcast/). The Contractor shall be required to perform as many as 15 distinct assays/platforms per year using in vitro assays (biochemical, cell-based, or 3D tissue constructs) and/or in vivo platforms using lower phylogenetic organisms, testing sets of approximately 20-100 chemicals per assay/platform.</p>
<p>b. Purpose and Objectives<br />The objective of this requirement is to perform testing of chemicals or chemical mixtures in a variety of in vitro (biochemical, cell-based, or 3D tissue constructs) or in vivo (using lower phylogenetic organisms) assay systems of complex and diverse biological capacity to measure chemical effects on critical pathways, processes, and phenotypes relevant to human toxicity to inform the direction of future NTP research efforts. These assays shall be biochemical, cell, tissue, or organism based culture systems with complex biological capacities such as xenobiotic metabolism, differentiation of cells, cell-to-cell signaling, gene expression, and/or epigenetic changes. Possible culture systems could include primary cells, stable cell lines, pluripotent cells, organotypic cultures, and 3D tissue constructs derived from various species/strains, possibly including human cell lines/tissues, or simple but whole organisms useful for evaluating the effects of environmental compounds. The endpoints measured in assays should provide mechanistic data that delineates critical toxicity pathways and quantifies cellular response to chemical exposures. Many of the types of compounds to be assayed may be only weakly active; therefore, the Contractor shall incorporate a plan for determining the maximally tolerated concentration, as defined as the highest concentration at which the compound can be tested without non-specific interference with the assay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. Project Requirements <br />A single Contract award is envisioned to perform testing of NIEHS-provided chemicals or chemical mixtures in commercially available assays meeting the Government's requirement. The Contractor be responsible for the: 1) Review of all protocols provided by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to ensure that the assays performed as described will result in useful, interpretable, publication quality data; 2) Testing of NIEHS-provided chemicals or chemical mixtures in required assays and completion of COR-identified statistical analyses of the test results; and 3) Preparation of draft and draft final study reports, including documentation of Quality Assurance and Quality Control measures, for submission and approval by the COR.<br />The Contractor shall perform testing of chemicals or chemical mixtures in a variety of in vitro (biochemical, cell-based, or 3D tissue constructs) or in vivo (using lower phylogenetic organisms) assay systems with complex and diverse biological capacities in order to measure chemical effects on critical pathways, processes, and phenotypes relevant to human toxicity as specified by the COR. Each specification may include multiple assays of a similar type (e.g., nuclear receptor assays could focus on the estrogen, androgen, and thyroid receptors). Each assay shall be defined as a unique set of features including, but not restricted to, organism/cell type; molecular target; toxicity pathway; and/or assay-/platform-specific conditions, and may require the capacity for xenobiotic metabolism, differentiation of cells, cell-to-cell signaling, gene expression, or epigenetic changes. Assays shall be in-house developed, commercial-off-the-shelf, or modified commercial-off-the-shelf and previously demonstrated to be reliable and relevant for its intended purpose. Assays identified in the EPA ToxCast Program (http://epa.gov/ncct/toxcast/) are representative, but not all inclusive, of the type of assays that may be performed under this requirement. It is anticipated that the Contractor shall be responsible for testing a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 100 chemicals/mixtures per assay (provided by the Government), with a maximum of 15 assays to be performed per year. Assays shall be performed in 6-, 12-, 24-, 48-, 96-, 384-, or 1536-well plate format, or other agreed-upon format, at up to 10 treatment concentrations, with up to 3 exposure durations. New assay development is not intended under the terms of this contract; however, emerging assays with sufficient evidence of reliability may be considered. Commercial-off-the-shelf assays may need minor modifications to meet the needs of the Government. The requirements for each assay [project scope including goals of the study, assay type, specific chemicals to be assayed, recommended protocols, quality and reporting requirements and documentation, analysis methods, etc.] will be defined by the COR and provided to the Contractor prior to initiation of any assay or platform. Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all qualified personnel, materials, facilities, and equipment to provide services to the Government, with the exception that the Government will supply all test chemicals.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables<br />The Contractor shall submit to the COR for approval minutes of all meetings, either face-to-face, conference-call, or web-based, as well as Draft and Final Draft Study Reports, to include materials and methods, results, summary data, raw data, and documented deviations from SOPs and protocols, for each study. Reports shall contain the following information (at a minimum) for each set of test articles assayed, in electronic files on compact disc (CD), digital video disk (DVD), email or other mutually agreed upon digital means and in Government compatible format: compound key; assay name; assay date; cell/organism type; cell type/organism species; endpoints measured; description of endpoints; positive control identity; positive control bioactivity results; estimates of maximally tolerated concentrations for each compound; compound screening concentrations; screening results, treated and controls, raw data; compound bioactivity results, well level, expressed as percent of control; annotated images obtained during screening (if applicable); short assay protocol; and QA/QC test results.</p>
<p>Other deliverables include Contractor protocols and SOPs appropriate to meet the assay requirements as detailed by the COR, Draft Quarterly Progress Reports, Final Quarterly Reports, Draft Annual Report, Final Annual Report, Summary of Salient Results, Annual Utilization Report, Final Invention Statement.</p>
<p>d. Anticipated Contract Type and Period of Performance<br />It is anticipated that the Government will make one Firm Fixed Price type of award consisting of a unit price per assay. The anticipated period of performance shall be for one year (12 months) 2013 through 2014 for the base year of the award, with four (4) one year options (2014 through 2018) for a total of five (5) years if all optional periods of performance are exercised.</p>
<p>e. Other important considerations<br />The Government will require a variety of different assays. Chemical compounds are to be treated as hazardous and potentially carcinogenic. The contractor, and/or subcontractor(s) if applicable, should have experience handling hazardous and carcinogenic chemicals safely and disposing of waste safely. The Principal Investigator (PI) should have adequate experience in preparing and managing data organization as demonstrated by an advanced degree in laboratory-based research programs and publication of scientific data, and analysis at a level for publication in peer-reviewed journals. It is preferred that the PI have experience with management of subcontractors, since it is anticipated that resources may be required of multiple subcontractors. Offerors should have a plan for QA/QC of all data acquired under the anticipated contract from in-house and/or subcontracted sources. It is anticipated that a final report shall be submitted upon the completion of each assay, and that quarterly status reports will be required to document the on-going and future progress of the contract.</p>

<DESC>The Department of the Army, Healthcare Acquisition Activity- North intends to negotiate a Sole Source commercial item procurement with  GE Healthcare for GE based software compatible with CT750 HD machine to include Snapshot Freeze Option, GSI cardiac option, CardIQ Xpress 2.0 base upgrade, and GSI viewer I.B. upgrade as well as two day training.  This proposed procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than February 8th, 2013 5pm. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Point of contact Michele Devine, Contract Specialist, e-mail: michele.g.devine.ctr@us.army.mil  <br> 	 <br> The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6). <br>  <br> GE software must be compatible with the CT750 HD machine already installed. The software will allow the technologist to manipulate the raw data to give a better image of the cardiac vessels. It will also allow the radiologist to give a better diagnosis of the condition of a patients heart and blood vessels surrounding the heart because of the increased detail allowed by the upgrade. The sole source will avoid duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or the unacceptable delays due to the government. CT exams can be increased with a correlating increase of cardiac patients.  <br>

<a href="mailto:joy.d.kamara@amedd.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/COMMENTS (RFI) SYNOPSIS ONLY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RFI SYNOPSIS IS TO SEEK INFORMATION/COMMENT REGARDING THE PROCUREMENT OF A DEPLOYABLE 120 LPM OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR FOR THE U.S. ARMY MEDICAL MATERIEL AGENCY (USAMMA), FORT DETRICK, MARYLAND. <br>  <br> REQUEST FOR INFORMATION TITLE: USAMMA 120 LPM OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR <br>  <br> DISCLAIMER:  <br> The attached draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued solely for market research, information, and planning purposes only. This Request for Information (RFI) does not constitute an Invitation for Bid, a Request for Proposal, or a Request for Quotation. <br>  <br> Ideas contained herein may change significantly during the requirement's ongoing program design, consultation, and approval process. In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review. <br>  <br> This RFI does not commit the Government to the award of a contract.  Availability of any formal solicitation resulting from this RFI, if a solicitation is released,  will be synopysized separately on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (http://www.fbo.gov). <br>   <br> PROPOSALS ARE NOT REQUESTED AT THIS TIME AND WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. <br>  <br> Submitting entities should review FAR 3.104 and FAR subpart 24.2 which sets forth the Government's obligations to protect information submitted in response to this RFI. <br>  <br> Pursuant to FAR 15.201(f), information to be provided by the Government in a public forum to a potential respondent in response to such respondent's request must not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the potential Respondent's confidential business strategy, and is protected under FAR 3.104 or FAR subpart 24.2. (Nonetheless, Respondents should properly mark their responses if the information is confidential). <br>   <br> The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is, 339999, All Other Miscellaneous Manufacturing. The small business size standard is 500 employees. Your response should identify your business size (large or small) in relation to the NAICS code.  <br>  <br> BACKGROUND: The results of the Army's prior solicitation for a deployable 120LPM Oxygen Concentrator were less than satisfactory.  From this procurement, the testing of demonstration units in field conditions did not meet the Army's requirements. These systems were unsatisfactory in terms of reliability, availability and maintainability.  The Army would like industry to review the requirements included in this draft RFP and submit recommendations focused on: <br> 1. Improvements to sustainability and maintainability of these systems.  <br> 2. The Army is interested in new technologies, new designs, and/or changes to configuration, employment, training, maintenance or other factors that would improve the overall reliability and sustainability of these systems.  <br> 3. The Army will review all comments and consider modifications to its requirements, based on industry input, before posting any subsequent RFP.  <br> 4. The Army is also interested in lead times for manufacture of improved systems and industries willingness to submit test articles in response to future RFP submissions. <br> 5. Are there any areas where interested parties believe a potential risk exists or will present itself by fulfilling the terms of the draft RFP? <br> 6. Is there any area within the draft RFP where interested parties believe the Government has failed to adequately set forth the stated requirements in a clear and unambiguous manner? <br> 7. Is there any area within the draft RFP that has an overall positive and/or negative impact on the process of evaluating contractor performance (i.e. performance objectives, evaluation process, etc.)? <br> 8. Is there any area within the draft RFP that appears unduly burdensome to either the Government or the Contractor towards the goal of achieving superior contractor performance? <br>  <br> RESPONSE INFORMATION: Responses to this draft RFP are strictly voluntary. Interested parties shall provide all feedback in writing no later than 2:00 PM (Eastern Standard Time), on February 28, 2013. Interested Parties may e-mail them to joy.d.kamara@us.army.mil or mail them to the following address:  <br>  <br> US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, ATTN: MCMR-AAA, 820 Chandler Street, <br> Frederick, MD 21702-5014 <br>  <br> Point of Contact: <br> Joy D.

This combined synopsis/solicitation was prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Requirements (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number for this requirement is FA8601-13-T-0118 using FAR Subpart 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65, 29 Jan 2013.</p>
<p>This solicitation document is Full and Open Competition under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334413. Size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The AFLCMC/PZIO Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract for the following requirements:</p>
<p>Requirements for the SiC Wafers, QTY (6):</p>
<p>1. Prime/Production grade means single crystal over the whole wafer with no grain boundaries and micropipe density less than 30 cm-2.<br />2. Wafers in round shape with the diameter of 3 inches (75 mm). <br />3. On-axis means surface parallel to the (0001) plane by 0.15 degrees or less.<br />4. Semi-insulating means a resistivity of 100,000 ohm-cm or higher over the whole wafer.<br />5. CMP is required on Si-face (0001) in addition to optical polish (on both faces) to reduce polishing damage to the wafer surface.<br />6. SiC comes in a variety of crystal structures called polytypes. Either 6H or 4H is acceptable.<br />7. 3C SiC is often grown on Si wafers. This material is not acceptable because the Si wafer cannot be made semi-insulating. <br />8. Only bulk wafers (a whole piece of SiC wafer with thickness larger than 350 microns) are acceptable. Thin layers of SiC on other substrates are not acceptable because of potential reactions between the substrate and the furnace environment where the wafers will be used.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is OPM2613Q0087 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC)<br />2005-64 dated January 18, 2013.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 611430 and the small business size standard is $10.0 million. This procurement is set-aside exclusively for small businesses, allowing only a small business to submit proposals.</p>
<p>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Center for Leadership Development (CLD) provides high quality leadership and management development for supervisors, managers and executives across the Federal government through both multi-agency and single-agency designed courses. OPM has established two leadership institutes, the Federal Executive Institute in Charlottesville (FEI), Virginia, and the Management Development Center's (MDC's) with locations in Shepherdstown, West Virginia and Aurora, Colorado. OPM also offers courses at the OPM Headquarters in Washington, D.C. and at other locations. <br /><br />As a Federal business enterprise, CLD provides services that assist Federal agencies in achieving their missions by providing competency-based leadership programs to build great leaders for great government. <br />In support of its mission, OPM needs to acquire up to (3) contractors to provide Visiting Program Director services to organize, facilitate and deliver up to (5) Management Development Seminars I: Learning from the Middle (MDS I). The Management Development Seminar-I is one of the core development programs designed to help managers learn and apply knowledge and skills that support their roles and responsibilities. Today's Federal managers often find themselves in the challenging position of operating "from the middle" and need the skills and insight to lead teams and influence leaders above them at the same time in ever more complex organizations. Self-understanding, communication skills, and insight into follower-leader relationships are critical for their success and often difficult to learn on the job. <br />The course methodology includes a variety of formats: lecture; self-assessments; group discussions and exercises; real world experiences and examples; and a small group consulting project. The program is nine days in length over a two week period. The program begins at 1:00 PM on the first Monday of the course and ends by 3:00 PM on the second Thursday of the course.</p>
<p>This course supports the development of the following OPM competencies: Accountability, Conflict Management, Developing Others, Leveraging Diversity, and Problem Solving. These competencies are part of the OPM Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs) which are used as indicators of leadership success in the federal government. For more information on the ECQs please see http://www.leadership.opm.gov/.</p>
<p>OPM intends to award up to (3) Firm-fixed Price contracts to the offeror(s) that represents the best value to the government. The offerors shall provide all labor, incidental materials, and other services necessary to render services under the resulting contract, see Statement of Objectives (SOO) detailed below. The period of performance is listed in the SOO below.</p>
<p>Offerors are invited to submit their quotations to OPM Contracting in response to this notice by 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), February 13, 2013.

Quotations submitted in response to this notice shall include the solicitation number in the subject line and be signed, dated and submitted via email to Shannon.Kennedy@opm.gov.</p>
<p>Technical and Pricing proposals MUST be in two separate files. If your technical and price proposal is not submitted in two separate files, your response to this solicitation will be considered non-responsive and will not be given any further consideration. Each of the parts shall be separate and complete, so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of and concurrently with the evaluation of the others.<br />All communications shall be directed to the attention of:</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>This opportunity had originally been synopsized under RFP DTNH22-12-R-00531. Under that synopsis, NHTSA had planned to use a "Cascading" approach to contractor selection (where small businesses would be considered for award first, then (in the event no small business was selected) large businesses would be considered. That has now been changed to where this requirement is set-aside, 100%, for small businesses.</p>

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to solicit a competitive 8 (a) set-aside for obtaining contractor engineering support to assist in the design review and validation of the SENTINEL class patrol craft. The proposed acquisition will&nbsp;include a 12-month base period and two 12 month option periods. The Contractor shall also provide support tasks to include test inspection and quality assurance for SENTINEL class patrol craft during construction, shipyard trials, delivery and post-delivery warranty periods. Additional support is also required under this contract to provide record management, correspondence review &amp; tracking and meeting coordination at both PRO LOCKPORT and SETINEL Project Office in Washington, DC. The contract for eighteen SENTINEL class cutters has required the establishment of a Project Residence Office (PRO) at the Contractor's facility. The requested billet structure will remain unfulfilled as a result of limited USCG personnel resources. The scope of SETINEL construction and the breadth of technical expertise required cannot be supported with the government personnel currently assigned. The pace of this contract will demand an additional support structure of highly-skilled personnel, knowledgeable in design review, shipyard production management and quality assurance (QA). The most appropriate North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 541330-Engineering Services. All offers must be Small Business Administrative (SBA) - Certified 8 (a) participant. All capable responses must be received by 6:00 PM EST on 4&nbsp;February 2013 will be considered by the Government.

<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see:<br />http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa Regional Team, reports to the OTI Regional Team Lead or designee, and can be based anywhere in the world, but must be available for frequent and possibly long-term temporary duty assignments to Mali.  The incumbent might also have to live in temporary quarters or in a hotel for indefinite periods until the situation in Mali is stabilized.  Incumbent must be prepared for uncertainty in regards to the length of time that will be required to remain in Mali.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Mali country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>The OTI program in Mali will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Government to promote stability and democracy in Mali by providing assistance to support the political transition. In close coordination with the State Department representatives and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  She or he places a premium on building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Africa, the Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs, where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with them in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government, as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g.  Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc.).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative will report to OTI's Washington-based Team Leader for Africa, or his/her designee, as well as to the Mali Mission Director.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position for the OTI Mali program, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes.  Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>While in Bamako, the work is generally performed in an office environment.  However, the position also requires travel throughout host country, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.<br /> <br />Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI is an exciting, fast-paced, operational office in USAID. Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.<br /> <br />For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that OTI USPSC staff are deployed and supported expeditiously and programs started quickly, often with little or no lead time.  The Program Operations Advisor position is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support.  To achieve this, OTI requires a Program Operations Advisor who has the capacity to work well within a team environment, provide necessary support to a team, and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit.</p>
<p>A common characteristic among OTI staff is that they are operationally-minded, enjoy working in a fast-paced environment, and seek innovative ways to improve efficiency and effectiveness of operations support and programs.</p>
<p>The Program Operations Advisor is experienced in the multitude of functions that comprise program operations for USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives programs.  The Program Operations Advisor provides services which require professionalism, knowledge, diplomacy, and operational expertise in administrative support.  This individual must be readily available to provide the required services on an intermittent basis, often on short notice with little time for preparation.  While most of the work will be performed in Washington, there may be requirements for field travel.  OTI field offices are located in countries with complex problems, often in difficult and harsh environments, with some offices located in countries with no other USAID presence.  The Program Operations Advisor reports to the Chief of OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD) or his/her designee which may be the Deputy Chief of OMD or other OMD Team Leaders, the Chief of Field Programs Division (FPD) or FPD Regional Team Leaders.  The Program Operations Advisor will spend the majority of his or her time working with OMD support staff in Washington.  All of the field activities supported and the vast majority of the headquarters activities supported are transition program implementation-focused.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a Program Operations Advisor to support the Operations and Management Division within OTI.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Program Operations Advisor requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Program Operations Advisor requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The Program Operations Advisor is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Program Operations Advisor is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The Program Operations Advisor has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Program Operations Advisor is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The Program Operations Advisor will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide general administrative support for the supervisor and program-funded staff such as: scheduling and facilitating meetings; drafting meeting minutes; tracking and ensuring action items are followed up; scheduling and meeting logistics preparation; filing; correspondence control; and other administrative services as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare Acquisition and Assistance requests, security clearances/transfers, badge revalidation requests, GLAAS requests, and other time sensitive tasks;</p>
<p><br />&bull;	Assist with the management and administration of procurement in support of OTI country program activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Respond to requests for information and tasks regarding OTI programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Fill ad hoc critical administrative/operations support staffing needs in Washington, DC and the field, in support of program funded staff and program operations, in areas such as administrative support (e.g. records management, correspondence control, logistics assistance, other general administrative support), personnel and human resources support (e.g. payroll, awards, drafting personnel memos, etc.), information and technology, and travel and finance support;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, provide ad hoc operations support for new OTI country program start-ups, country program management and close-outs. Provide on-call technical assistance;</p>
<p>&bull;	As required, initiative and maintain effective relationships with institutional contractors, implementing partners, other agencies, and administrative support staff in other USAID offices sharing procedures and systems in order to review good administrative practices, and seek out innovative ways of doing business to improve efficiency and effectiveness;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide knowledge management support such as tracking documents, lessons learned, best practices across OTI programs and/or operations as required. Assist teams in the creation and/or maintenance of information products in support of political transition programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Coordinate closely with OTI's two divisions (Operations and Management Division and Field Programs Division) and the Program Office on all issues. Attend the respective team meetings, report out to the supervisor, ensure the supervisor's priorities are shared with other divisions/teams, etc. Backstop other Admin and Program Assistants on other teams when required.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Program Operations Advisor will take direction from and will report to the Chief - OTI Operations and Management Division (OMD) or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop work objectives, recurring tasks, projects to be accomplished and products to be produced and establish deadlines. The incumbent is then expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p><br />10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>    <br>  The solicitation number is W911QY-13-R-0022 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP), unless otherwise indicated herein.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-62, effective December 20, 2012.  This will be a full and open competition to provide a Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW) that will be used to decontaminate sensitive equipment (such as weapons system optics and electronics) and non-sensitive equipment under NAICS code 325998 -- All Other Miscellaneous Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing.   <br>    <br>  The small business size standard is 500 employees. Multiple awards are anticipated.  The number of awards will be dependent upon the number of Offerors with qualifying products and available funds.  Any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 12.  The Government anticipates awarding approximately three (3) contracts under this solicitation, but reserves the right to award, more or less than three awards, a single award, or no awards, if in the best interest of the Government. Funds are not presently available for this acquisition. No contract award will be made until appropriated funds are made available. Contract award(s) resulting from this solicitation are subject to availability of funds.    <br>    <br>  The Attachments listed in this solicitation may be downloaded from the ASFI website: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi.  The Government intends to award a contract(s) WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS with Offerors, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be necessary in the best interests of the Government.  Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  <br>    <br>  DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:  <br>    <br>  This solicitation is for the provision of all labor and expertise necessary to provide a Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW) in accordance with the requirements of this solicitation.  The JSEW concept represents an individual product or kit intended to decontaminate sensitive and non-sensitive equipment, which can be easily carried by the warfighter during decontamination operations and/or while conducting missions that may require decontamination to be performed. The following product characteristics are desired:   <br>    <br>  - Commercial products with the ability to decrease the level of gross chemical agent contamination from 10 g/m2 to  1 g/m2 in support of thorough decontamination on sensitive and non-sensitive equipment.   <br>  - Commercial products that can be applied directly to equipment surfaces and capable of removing gross contamination within five minutes following application.   <br>  - Commercial products that are available in durable packaging that can be easily opened by a Warfighter wearing Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) 4.   <br>  - Products that are non-hazardous, non-flammable and inherently safe, minimizing hazards to both personnel and the environment, and that do not produce uncontrollable residual hazards during the decontamination process.   <br>  - Products that do not cause material/equipment degradation when used to decontaminate sensitive and non-sensitive equipment.   <br>  - Products that do not cause false positives/negatives for fielded tactical detectors.   <br>  - Products that do not degrade military relevant Individual Protection Equipment (IPE) or the effectiveness or ability of fielded decontamination products.  <br>    <br>  Each JSEW, in its designed configuration of components, must perform the functions necessary for successful completion of the JSEW mission, meet all of the physical characteristic requirements in the Draft Performance Specification (PSPEC) (Attachment 1) and decontaminate traditional and non-traditional chemical agents on sensitive and non-sensitive equipment to the efficacy levels specified in the PSPEC. The unit of measure in this solicitation is each (EA). The Offeror is to consider  quote mark one each quote mark  as all of the necessary components, packaged together as one item or kit, necessary to decontaminate sensitive or non-sensitive equipment as specified in the PSPEC.    <br>    <br>  To access the full Solicitation W911QY-13-R-0022 and its attachments, click on the Solicitation Documents/Attachments link on this page.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal. (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction. <BR> <BR>(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so.

For projects which were designed for other government entities, submit the performance appraisal sheets used by that government entity if available.  3.) For projects not covered in the ACASS database or by other governmental performance appraisal sheets, submit a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (see c. below for information regarding PPQs).   <br>      <br>   a.	ACASS Evaluations   <br>      <br>   Firms are requested to retrieve their ACASS past performance information directly from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at http://www.ppirs.gov.  PPIRS is an electronic repository of performance information collected by all the major federal performance reporting systems.  Logging onto PPIRS will require the following:  All firms must have purchased and installed a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate.  If you do not have this certificate, you cannot access your information.  Additional information about the PKI certificate is posted in red at the top, center portion, of the http://www.ppirs.gov web page.  You will also need your DUNS number and Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) to log onto PPIRS.  The MPIN number was selected by whoever registered your firm in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov .  If you do not know your MPIN number, you will need to contact the CCR help desk by emailing them from the email link on the http://www.ccr.gov/help.asp web page.  Please be aware that they will only release the MPIN number to the person who originally registered your firm.   <br>      <br>   There are two other ways to obtain a copy of ACASS evaluations as follows: (1) Contact your government point of contact for the project you mentioned, and ask them if they can send you a copy, or (2) Apply for  quote mark Contractor Corporate Senior Management Representative quote mark  access on the following ACASS web page:  http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. This type of access is issued to only one person within the firm, typically a member of senior management.  In addition to access to your completed ACASS performance evaluations, you will also be able to view status of evaluations which have not yet been completed.  Following receipt of your faxed application request, you will be emailed a logon and access instructions.  This type of access will only let you see ACASS information, so it is not as complete as PPIRS access which allows access to evaluations prepared by non-DOD federal agencies, as well as the DOD agencies which use ACASS.  Be aware that you will also need to have a PKI certificate to access the ACASS system.  This is a DOD requirement.   <br>      <br>   b.	Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ)   <br>      <br>   The Past Performance Questionnaire is provided for the offeror (available as a download with this announcement - see the  quote mark Packages quote mark  tab) or its team members to submit to the client.  The Past Performance Questionnaire should be completed by an owner or owner's representative not affiliated with your firm.  Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.   <br>      <br>   Completed Past Performance Questionnaires should be submitted with your proposal. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing date, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ, which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).  Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their proposal PPQs previously submitted for other RFPs; however, they may be submitted in full text if they exist (i.e. offerors are not required to re-obtain PPQs for the same project).  PPQs already in the possession of Offerors may be on other/previous versions of PPQs.  New PPQs must only be obtained on the form available for download with this announcement and submitted for projects for which the Offeror does not already have a completed PPQ, in one version or another (and, again, PPQs are only required if ACASS or other governmental performance appraisal sheets are not available for submission with the Offer - see a. above).   <br>      <br>   c.	Government Utilization of Alternate Information Sources for Past Performance   <br>      <br>   The Government will assess the past performance on projects submitted and reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews with points of contact identified in the proposal or to review personal knowledge.  In addition, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance of the Offeror on the submitted projects and any other previous work. Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture, teaming arrangement, or parent company/subsidiary/affiliate) identified in the offeror's proposal, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.   <br>      <br>   While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror.   <br>      <br>   d.	The Government will give the awardee(s) an Option to work overseas.  Please advise if you would be interested in OCONUS work.    <br>       <br>   Announcement Section C - Ratings and Definitions   <br>      <br>      <br>   i.	The following ratings will be used to evaluate documentation submitted by offerors (note that documentation submitted for evaluation in response to this announcement may be referred to throughout this announcement as an  quote mark offer quote mark ,  quote mark proposal quote mark , or  quote mark response quote mark  - all of which are representative of the SF330 information being requested by this announcement):   <br>      <br>   	Exceptional - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in the majority of the aspects of the particular factor. Strengths are present indicating maximum benefit to the government and no weaknesses, significant weaknesses or deficiencies are indicated.   <br>      <br>   	Above Average - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in many aspects of the particular factor.  Strengths are present indicating significant benefit to the government.  The proposal may have weaknesses that have no impact on the proposal as a whole and do not require correction.     <br>      <br>   	Average - The offer matches the scope of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be strengths but they may not aggregate into an advantage indicating additional benefit to the Government, or they may be offset by weaknesses.  Any weaknesses noted have only a minor impact on the proposal and are easily correctable.     <br>      <br>   	Marginal - The offer matches some, but not all, of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be limited or individual strengths, but they do not aggregate into an advantage and are offset by weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies.  Weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies are correctable without major revision to the proposal.  The Government may still receive benefit from the offer submitted.   <br>   	Unacceptable - The offer fails to meet a majority of announcement requirements or has omitted critical information required to evaluate the factor.  There are no strengths.  The offer contains multiple weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies, which are all correctable only with major revision to the proposal.  A proposal that receives a final rating of  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  for any factor may not be considered for award.   <br>      <br>   Neutral - In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably on past performance.   <br>      <br>   ii.	Definitions:   <br>      <br>   Strength - Any aspect of a proposal that, when judged against a stated evaluation factor, enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract.   <br>      <br>   Weakness - A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  A  quote mark significant weakness quote mark  in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.   <br>      <br>   Deficiency - A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.   <br>      <br>   Announcement Section D - Submission Instructions, Selection Process and Additional Information   <br>      <br>   i.	Eligible interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit ONE (1) ORIGINAL AND TWO (2) COPIES, each containing Parts I and II of the SF330 information for the prime firm and all subcontractors/subconsultants (as necessary), as directed with respect to time, date, place of receiving proposals and acceptable methods of delivery identified in item iii. of this Announcement Section D.

ACASS Evaluations  <br>    <br>  Firms are requested to retrieve their ACASS past performance information directly from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at http://www.ppirs.gov.  PPIRS is an electronic repository of performance information collected by all the major federal performance reporting systems.  Logging onto PPIRS will require the following:  All firms must have purchased and installed a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate.  If you do not have this certificate, you cannot access your information.  Additional information about the PKI certificate is posted in red at the top, center portion, of the http://www.ppirs.gov web page.  You will also need your DUNS number and Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) to log onto PPIRS.  The MPIN number was selected by whoever registered your firm in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov .  If you do not know your MPIN number, you will need to contact the CCR help desk by emailing them from the email link on the http://www.ccr.gov/help.asp web page.  Please be aware that they will only release the MPIN number to the person who originally registered your firm.  <br>    <br>  There are two other ways to obtain a copy of ACASS evaluations as follows: (1) Contact your government point of contact for the project you mentioned, and ask them if they can send you a copy, or (2) Apply for  quote mark Contractor Corporate Senior Management Representative quote mark  access on the following ACASS web page:  http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. This type of access is issued to only one person within the firm, typically a member of senior management.  In addition to access to your completed ACASS performance evaluations, you will also be able to view status of evaluations which have not yet been completed.  Following receipt of your faxed application request, you will be emailed a logon and access instructions.  This type of access will only let you see ACASS information, so it is not as complete as PPIRS access which allows access to evaluations prepared by non-DOD federal agencies, as well as the DOD agencies which use ACASS.  Be aware that you will also need to have a PKI certificate to access the ACASS system.  This is a DOD requirement.  <br>    <br>  b.	Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ)  <br>    <br>  The Past Performance Questionnaire is provided for the offeror (available as a download with this announcement - see the  quote mark Packages quote mark  tab) or its team members to submit to the client.  The Past Performance Questionnaire should be completed by an owner or owner's representative not affiliated with your firm.  Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.  <br>    <br>  Completed Past Performance Questionnaires should be submitted with your proposal. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing date, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ, which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).  Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their proposal PPQs previously submitted for other RFPs; however, they may be submitted in full text if they exist (i.e. offerors are not required to re-obtain PPQs for the same project).  PPQs already in the possession of Offerors may be on other/previous versions of PPQs.  New PPQs must only be obtained on the form available for download with this announcement and submitted for projects for which the Offeror does not already have a completed PPQ, in one version or another (and, again, PPQs are only required if ACASS or other governmental performance appraisal sheets are not available for submission with the Offer - see a. above).  <br>    <br>  c.	Government Utilization of Alternate Information Sources for Past Performance  <br>    <br>  The Government will assess the past performance on projects submitted and reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews with points of contact identified in the proposal or to review personal knowledge.  In addition, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance of the Offeror on the submitted projects and any other previous work. Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture, teaming arrangement, or parent company/subsidiary/affiliate) identified in the offeror's proposal, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.  <br>    <br>  While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror.  <br>    <br>  d.	 The Government will give the awardee an option to work overseas.  Please advise if you would be interested in OCONUS work.  <br>    <br>  Announcement Section C - Ratings and Definitions  <br>    <br>    <br>  i.	The following ratings will be used to evaluate documentation submitted by offerors (note that documentation submitted for evaluation in response to this announcement may be referred to throughout this announcement as an  quote mark offer quote mark ,  quote mark proposal quote mark , or  quote mark response quote mark  - all of which are representative of the SF330 information being requested by this announcement):  <br>    <br>  	Exceptional - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in the majority of the aspects of the particular factor. Strengths are present indicating maximum benefit to the government and no weaknesses, significant weaknesses or deficiencies are indicated.  <br>    <br>  	Above Average - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in many aspects of the particular factor.  Strengths are present indicating significant benefit to the government.  The proposal may have weaknesses that have no impact on the proposal as a whole and do not require correction.    <br>    <br>  	Average - The offer matches the scope of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be strengths but they may not aggregate into an advantage indicating additional benefit to the Government, or they may be offset by weaknesses.  Any weaknesses noted have only a minor impact on the proposal and are easily correctable.    <br>    <br>  	Marginal - The offer matches some, but not all, of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be limited or individual strengths, but they do not aggregate into an advantage and are offset by weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies.  Weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies are correctable without major revision to the proposal.  The Government may still receive benefit from the offer submitted.  <br>  	Unacceptable - The offer fails to meet a majority of announcement requirements or has omitted critical information required to evaluate the factor.  There are no strengths.  The offer contains multiple weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies, which are all correctable only with major revision to the proposal.  A proposal that receives a final rating of  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  for any factor may not be considered for award.  <br>    <br>  Neutral - In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  <br>    <br>  ii.	Definitions:  <br>    <br>  Strength - Any aspect of a proposal that, when judged against a stated evaluation factor, enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract.  <br>    <br>  Weakness - A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  A  quote mark significant weakness quote mark  in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  <br>    <br>  Deficiency - A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.  <br>    <br>  Announcement Section D - Submission Instructions, Selection Process and Additional Information  <br>    <br>  i.	Eligible interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit ONE (1) ORIGINAL AND TWO (2) COPIES, each containing Parts I and II of the SF330 information for the prime firm and all subcontractors/subconsultants (as necessary), as directed with respect to time, date, place of receiving proposals and acceptable methods of delivery identified in item iii. of this Announcement Section D.  Part I, Part II and Sections of the submitted SF330 information (reference SF330 instructions for definitions of Part I, Part II and Sections) of each copy shall be separated by tabs (dividers) and clearly marked.  Part I, Section H shall include all information requested per this announcement that does not reasonably fit, in the offeror's best estimation, into any other Sections of SF330 Part I or Part II.  <br>    <br>  FOR THE PRIME OFFEROR, PROVIDE THE FIRM'S DUNS NUMBER AND CAGE CODE IN SF330, PART I, BLOCK B, BOX 5.  FOR SUBCONTRACTORS/SUBCONSULTANTS, PROVIDE THESE FIRMS' DUNS NUMBERS AND CAGE CODES IN SF330, PART I, BLOCK C, BOX 9.  <br>    <br>  All proposers, including joint-ventures, must be registered in the System For Award Management (SAM)  at https://www.sam.gov and have completed their Online Representations and Certification Application (ORCA) section.  <br>    <br>  All proposals submitted will become, upon receipt, the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  After evaluation of proposals, the original will be retained for the official contract file.  Extra copies of the awardee's proposal may be provided to other offices for carrying out contract administration functions.  Any extra copies of proposals deemed unnecessary by the government will be destroyed.  <br>    <br>  ii.	Upon completion of evaluation of the SF 330 offers received, a short list of most qualified firms will be determined.  Until selection is completed, there will be no notification of any type to proposing firms.  Once the short list is approved by the Source Selection Authority, those firms that did not make the short list will be promptly notified.  There will be one contract awarded as a result of negotiations.  The contract will have $3 million capacity and a period of performance of 5 years.   <br>    <br>  iii.	Completed SF 330 information must reach the Contracting Division Offices not later than 2:00 p.m. (Central/local time) on Friday, 01-Mar-2013.

On the date specified and for thirty (30) minutes prior to the specified time, a Contracting representative will be in the lobby of the building at the above address to receive offers. Containers (e.g. envelopes, packages, boxes) will be screened for security purposes.  Hand-carried means the individual must be able to carry on their person.  If due to size or volume, packages or boxes need to be wheeled in on a cart or dolly, you will be required to go to the dock area located on the northeast side of the facility. After inspection and screening, you will be allowed in the building after presenting valid photo identification.  At the offer due date/time specified above, it will be announced that receipt of proposals is closed. Official time will be established by a clock designated by the Contracting representative receiving hand-carried proposals, to be located in the area of proposals being received.  Recent terrorist threats have resulted in more time-consuming sign-in and escort procedures and may impact the timely delivery of offers.  This instruction shall also apply to those proposals delivered through a delivery or parcel service.  NOTE:  No parking on the street in front of the facility entrances will be allowed.  Passenger vehicles will need to locate parking meters or parking garages before delivering proposals.  Delivery trucks must go to the dock.  The vehicle will be inspected and packages screened at the dock.

Please continue to monitor FBO (www.fbo.gov; solicitation ID:  W9128F-13-R-0019) for changes to this announcement.

<p>This requirement is for the upgrade and repair of 109 B.E. Meyers MOUT/Tracker camera assemblies.</p>
<p>A.2 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Government's facility contains 109 MOUT/Tracker Cameras manufactured by B.E. Meyers. The cameras contain a daytime color camera and a no light black and white camera that utilizes an infrared illuminator. The camera assembly detects light levels and automatically energizes the IR illuminator and the night time camera when light levels are reduced. The illuminators installed in the cameras are set to a bandwidth that is not visible with MIL SPEC night vision goggles. The cameras were installed in 2006 and are in need of a circuit board upgrade and miscellaneous repairs to extend their life cycle.</p>
<p>A.3 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to purchase, design, fabricate, install, and test a circuit board upgrade in 109 B.E. Meyers MOUT/Tracker cameras. Evaluate IR illuminator output. Evaluate cameras for other needed repairs and complete authorized repairs.</p>
<p>SOW PART B-WORK REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>B.1 CIRCUIT BOARD UPGRADE</p>
<p>B.1.1 The Government shall ship the cameras to the contractor in increments of 20. The final increment may be less than 20.</p>
<p>B.1.2 The contractor shall evaluate the camera to determine if it is cost feasible to upgrade the main control board. If a camera has repairs (excluding the control board upgrade) totaling more than 33% of the cost for a new camera, the contractor shall not install a main control board and deem the camera as "not repairable". The Government considers the 33% threshold to be $1400.00.</p>
<p>B.1.3 Any diagnostic fee charged by the contractor shall be applied to camera upgrades and repairs. If the camera was deemed non-repairable the contractor shall be entitled to a predetermined fee for diagnostics.</p>
<p>B.1.4 The contractor shall purchase, design, fabricate, install, and test an upgraded main control board in 109 MOUT/Tracker cameras, or a quantity equal to those deemed "repairable" in item B.1.2. The upgraded board shall incorporate a heat sink on the main board and correct deficiencies identified in the original design. The circuit board shall be compatible with other components in the camera and not affect its normal operating parameters.</p>
<p>B.1.5 If the contractor fails to identify repairs that exceed the 33% threshold prior to installing the main control board the contractor shall complete those repairs at its own expense.</p>
<p>B.1.6 The contractor shall ship cameras to the Government upon completion of the main control board upgrade, unless other repairs are pending. Cameras deemed non-repairable can be utilized for parts to repair other cameras. The contractor shall not invoice for parts removed from non-repairable cameras. All non-repairable cameras/parts shall be returned to the Government upon the completion of the upgrade and repair of all cameras.</p>
<p>B.2 CAMERA REPAIRS</p>
<p>B.2.1 The contractor shall provide a written report via email, in PDF format, itemizing the repairs for each group of twenty cameras. Report shall identify cameras by serial number.</p>
<p>B.2.2 The report shall include power output of the IR illuminator by camera serial number.</p>
<p>B.2.3 Upon authorization by DESIGNATED Government personnel, the contractor shall repair specified cameras. The Government intends to complete all repairs that do not exceed 33% of the replacement cost for a new camera.</p>
<p>B.2.4 If the contractor initiates repairs and then discovers repairs it failed to identify in the report, which cause the 33% threshold to be exceeded, the contractor shall complete those repairs at its own expense.</p>
<p>B.2.5 Upon completion of repairs for each increment of 20 the contractor shall ship cameras to the Government.</p>
<p>B.2.6 The Government will continue to ship cameras in increments of 20 as it receives repaired units back from the contractor.</p>
<p>B.2.7 The contractor shall ship all non-repairable cameras and parts to the Government upon completion of camera upgrades and repairs.</p>
<p>B.3 CAMERA UPGRADE AND REPAIR</p>
<p>B.3.1 The MOUT/Tracker Camera is designed and manufactured by B.E. Meyers and contains proprietary design features. The contractor completing repairs and upgrades shall not modify the camera housing or dimensions. The contractor shall be an authorized B.E. Meyers service provider. Installed parts must return the cameras to within their original operating specifications and capabilities. Any illuminators replaced shall not emit a bandwidth visible with MIL SPEC night vision goggles.</p>

The TA will also include training that would build the capacity of NEDCo'S staff to implement the TA's recommendations.<br /><br />NEDCo is a subsidiary of the Volta River Authority (VRA), Ghana's state owned generation company, and operates Ghana's northern distribution network. Due to low customer density in the north, NEDCo's distribution network was developed with relaxed design standards in order to make the distribution network extension economically feasible. The relaxed network standards have led to extensive technical, non-technical, and collection losses in the north reaching almost forty percent. Thus NEDCo has prioritized loss reduction through pre-paid metering and smart grid technologies as well as capacity building for its operations and management staff. These efforts are geared towards effective management and improved services to a fast growing customer base. The TA will assist NEDCo in developing a five-year investment plan, which will identify necessary procurements in areas related to demand side management, load management, and networks operations, control, and management. The TA will also include training that would build the capacity of NEDCo's staff to implement the TA's recommendations. Portions of a background Definitional Mission are provided for reference in Annex 2.<br /><br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$410,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br />https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp<br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p><br />Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

<SUBJECT>Propulsion Subsystem Support Contract (PSSC)
<SOLNBR>FA8214-13-R-0003
<NTYPE>SRCSGT
<RESPDATE>030413
<CONTACT>Jed Noorda, Contracting Officer, Phone 8017772694, Email jed.noorda@hill.af.mil - Casey P Wiseman, Contracting Officer, Phone 801-777-3506, Email casey.wiseman@hill.af.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this posting is to publish a new Sources Sought Synopsis for the Propulsion Subsystem Support Contract dated February 1, 2013.<br /><br />The purpose of this SSS is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside.
<p>The Government intends to establish a new Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Propulsion Subsystem Support Contract (PSSC). This contract will consist of maintenance and engineering services to support the sustainment and acquisition activities for the Propulsion Subsystem in achieving its mission to integrate and coordinate all activities necessary to assess, to report, and to sustain the operational capability and reliability of the ICBM Propulsion System. Responses should be received by close of business March 04, 2013.</p>
<p>The PSSC will include work related to ICBM solid rocket motors (1st, 2nd, and 3rd stage propulsion), liquids (Propulsion System Rocket Engine), flight controls, system ordnance, and flight batteries. The Propulsion Subsystem Contract scope will include but not be limited to basic propulsion sustainment, aging surveillance, repairs and refurbishment efforts, modification programs, developmental and production engineering, production and deployment programs, and test and evaluation for the ICBM Propulsion Subsystem and related support equipment. Other activities will include systems engineering, configuration management, nuclear surety, nuclear hardness, closed-loop failure analysis, assisting the government in resolving field related problems and issues, mishap investigations, Air Force Technical Order actions, depot repair related issues, subsystem component design/redesign, vendor qualification, and parts availability. The successful offeror will be required to interface with the ICBM Integration Support Contractor (ISC) as well as provide input and participation to the integration efforts of other contractors that support the ICBM Mission.</p>
<p>The contractor must have resident technical knowledge and expertise of the ICBM propulsion system, and related field and depot level facilities and support equipment in order to augment the government's technical knowledge and expertise. These activities require a suite of peculiar support capabilities which include large solid rocket motor production capabilities and liquid propulsion production capabilities. There are a limited number of production facilities in existence that are currently being utilized for ongoing ICBM Propulsion activities. Without the required capabilities, the production portion of PSSC will not be executable.</p>
<p>Recent market research activities revealed a teaming approach consisting of ICBM Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to satisfy PSSC requirements. This team is the only known source that has the required capabilities needed to meet the aforementioned requirements. This sources sought synopsis constitutes another call to industry to determine if additional responsible sources exist to meet the needs of this requirement.</p>
<p>Responses to this SSS must clearly demonstrate that the contractor has the necessary knowledge and understanding of requirements and the facilities, support equipment, and employees with the ability to perform the requirements listed above as a prime contractor. If the contractor does not currently have the capabilities, the contractor must be able to demonstrate how it will gain access to the capabilities as well as provide a detailed schedule showing how long it will take to get these capabilities to an operational and qualified level of capability.</p>
<p>Disclaimer:</p>
<p>This SSS does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or any obligation on behalf of the Government. The responses to this SSS are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No contract award will be made on the basis of this SSS. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this SSS, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information. Vendor participation is not a promise of future business with the Government. Any information provided in response to this SSS will be used for informational purposes only and will not be returned. All proprietary information should be clearly marked as such. All information submitted by respondents to this SSS, including appropriately marked proprietary information, will be safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure.</p>
<p>All responses to this SSS shall be submitted in writing (e-mail preferred) to the government contracting point of contact (POC) listed below:</p>
<p>POC: Jed Noorda, Contracting Officer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AFNWC/PZBF 6014 Dogwood Ave (Bldg 1258)&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill AFB, UT 84056-5816<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phone: (801) 777-2694<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-mail <a href="mailto:jed.noorda@hill.af.mil">jed.noorda@hill.af.mil</a></p>
<p>All submission shall not exceed 10 pages. Electronic submissions should be compatible with Microsoft Office 2007 products or Adobe Acrobat Reader. Any questions with this requirement can be directed to the POC listed above.</p>

All proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.

The Contractor is required to be "Export Controlled" certified to receive and view the drawings for this solicitation.

The Government is NOT required to delay contract award to review a pending Source Approval Request (SAR). Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit SARs AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. If the Government has not completed review of a SAR when the contract is awarded the SAR will be retained and the source will be reviewed for possible source approval for future awards. First Article testing is required to ensure the reliability and integrity of the item and operational safety of the weapon system that uses it.

Note: Determination of acceptability of 'or similar' items may only be made by the engineering office initiating this First Article requirement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to contact the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

<DESC>Update: Solicitation is expected to be posted by 15 Feb 2013.<br /><br />The Indian Health Service (IHS), Division of Engineering-Dallas is soliciting a 100%, competitive Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and construction efforts to support the Navajo Area Facilities Engineering, Navajo Indian Reservation, Northern Arizona and the Albuquerque Area Facilities Engineering Division Office and Sanitation Divisions in the State of New Mexico.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>In accordance with Public Law 100-656, this procurement is a 51% Buy Indian Set Aside. </strong>
<p><em>"The proposed contract listed herein is Set Aside under the Buy Indian Act for 51 percent Indian owned, controlled and operated firms. In accordance with the Indian Health Service Acquisition Regulation, Paragraph 370.503(E), not more than 50 percent of the work to be performed under a prime contract awarded pursuant to the Buy Indian Act, shall be subcontracted to other than Indian firms. For this purpose, work to be performed does not include the provision of materials, supplies or equipment. Contractors shall indicate they are 51 percent Indian owned, controlled and operated firm and provide tribal certifications of affiliation."</em><br /><br />A MACC is an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract that is awarded to multiple firms who gives Indian Health Service the greatest confidence that they can meet our requirements. Contractors awarded the MACC would be given fair opportunity to compete for projects described in individual task order solicitations and would be expected to accomplish a wide variety of construction tasks, including renovation, additions/upgrades, and new construction integrating multiple construction trades/disciplines. The intent is to award to the most highly qualified firms as a result of the solicitation and evaluation by the source selection board.</p>
<p>The selected Contractors shall provide for all labor, material, supplies, transportation, supervision and all other necessary items for complete and usable projects, performing all work in a workman like manner which are ordered and identified in each delivery order issued under this Multiple Award Construction Contract. Common trades which may be needed include, carpentry, plumbing, electrical, laborers, power equipment operators, cement workers, asbestos removers, painters, well drilling, water supply construction trades identified in the Davis Bacon Wage Determination and other trades common to the construction industry. The Contractor will be required to perform multi-discipline construction, repair and remodeling work using these trade workers.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possesses sufficient technical expertise and experience, possesses sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements are achieved and costs adequately controlled. IHS plans to include the following evaluation factors and sub-factors: 1) Technical Ability; 2) Past Performance; and 3) Pricing.</p>
<p>Within the Technical Ability Factor the following 4 sub-factors will be used: a) Organizational Structure b) Technical Capability/Execution; c) Cost Control Management, and d) Quality Control Procedures. Technical Ability and Past Performance Factors are considered equal in importance. The sub-factors within Technical Ability are also considered equal in importance. Combined, both factors are significantly more important than cost or price. Cost/Price, however, will contribute substantially to the selection decision and will be assessed for reasonableness.</p>
<p>The contract period shall commence on the date of contract award and shall remain in effect for 365 calendar days or until the maximum contract dollar amount is reached, which ever occurs first. The maximum program combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts will be $5 M to $15 M dollars per calendar year. There will be four (4) one year option periods which may be exercised at the Government's discretion with the same maximum award amount as the base year. There is no minimum guarantee for this contract. All Delivery/Task Orders will be competitively awarded (firm fixed-price) and contractors will be given a fair opportunity to compete with the other MACC contractors for the projects described in individual task order solicitations documents issued.</p>
<p><br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, Sector 23 Construction, Sub-sector 236 Construction of Buildings, Size Standard $33.5M; Sub-sector 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, Size Standard $33.5M (except Land Subdivision, $7M and Sub-sector 238 Specialty Trade Contractors, Size Standard $14M. As well as,</p>
<p><br />Offers are solicited only from business concerns that have active registrations in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236220 and Code 237110 must specifically be included in the Offer's approved business plan.</p>
<p><br />A Request for Proposal (RFP) utilizing best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 15.3) will be used.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />In using this approach, the Government seeks to award from three to five (3 to 5) contracts to Indian Firms that give the Indian Health Service the greatest confidence that they can meet our requirements identified in the evaluation factors presented. The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs controlled.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference for this solicitation will be scheduled. The date and location will be published in the RFP. For all offerors intending to submit a proposal, conference attendance is strongly encouraged.</p>

<p>Dear Prospective Offerors:</p>
<p>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission to the Philippines, is soliciting proposals from qualified local organizations interested in providing the services detailed in the attached RFP for a project that will be administered by USAID's Office of Economic Development and Governance (OEDG).</p>
<p>This procurement is being conducted through full and open competition among Philippine organizations only, for which the procedures for "contracting by negotiation, trade-off process" method of procurement, as described in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), will apply.</p>
<p>Proposals will be accepted from Philippine private, for-profit and non-profit organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) including universities, research organizations, professional associations, and other relevant special interest associations. Faith-based and community organizations are also eligible to participate. In support of USAID's interest in expanding the number and sustainability of development partners, USAID encourages proposals from potential new local partners.</p>
<p>USAID/Philippines plans to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) completion type contract. The maximum estimated amount of the contract (costs and fee) is US$ 24million covering a performance period of five years. Offerors must propose costs that they believe are appropriate, realistic and reasonable for the work. Cost proposals will be evaluated as part of the Best-Value procedure in determining contract award, including cost effectiveness of approaches to achieve the desired results.</p>
<p>This solicitation consists of this cover letter and the attached RFP. All Offerors are cautioned to carefully review this cover letter and the contents of the RFP.</p>
<p>Issuance of this solicitation and receipt of proposals from interested Offerors do not constitute a commitment on the part of the U.S Government or USAID to make an award.

<DESC>The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District will conduct a Pre-Solicitation Conference for the Mouth of the Columbia River (MCR) South Jetty Dune Augmentation project on 31 January 2013 at Robert Duncan Plaza in Portland, Oregon. The address is:   <br>      <br>   Robert Duncan Plaza   <br>   333 SW First Ave   <br>   Portland, OR 97204   <br>      <br>   All interested potential Prime Contractors in NAICS 237990 and Subcontractors in any related NAICS are invited to attend. The conference will take place in rooms 3H&J on the 3rd Floor of Robert Duncan Plaza.   <br>      <br>   The conference will begin at 10:00 AM. This Pre-Solicitation conference is for informational purposes only and is intended to give interested contractors an overview of the size, scope, and timeline of the project. The official solicitation is scheduled to be issued in May 2013.   <br>      <br>   Attendees are required to pre-register for the conference by emailing David Boone, Contract Specialist at david.c.boone@usace.army.mil.    <br>      <br>   Include the following information in the text of the email:    <br>      <br>   1. Individual attendee full name   <br>   2. Individual attendee email address   <br>   3. Company Name   <br>   4. Company CAGE Code   <br>   5. Telephone number   <br>      <br>   In the e-mail subject line, please include  quote mark Registration for MCR South Jetty Dune Augmentation Pre-Solicitation Conference quote mark . Any changes to the time, date, or location will be posted on FedBizOpps.gov as a modification to this Special Notice. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reserves the right to reduce the number of attendees per company should space availability present an issue. Please monitor this FedBizOpps.gov posting for any updates.  <br>    <br>    <br>  A dynamic revetment (cobble/gravel berm) will be constructed along the ocean side of the foredune (south of the south jetty) and will be approximately 1,100 linear feet. Construction of the dynamic revetment will occur within the Fort Stevens State Park.  The dynamic revetment will be constructed within an active coastal zone, where the water level during times of high tide or storm wave action may affect the work area.  Construction activity is anticipated to be initiated within the time frame of AUG - OCT 2013.  <br>    <br>  The foundation grade for the dynamic revetment will be located at approximately +8 ft NAVD. Mean Higher High tide is at +8.5 ft NAVD. Approximately 18,000 cy of sand may need to be excavated to meet the required foundation elevation for placement of material. Note the sand excavation will occur incrementally as the dynamic revetment is constructed in 100-200 ft long segments.  In this case, the volume of sand expected to be excavated per 100-ft revetment segment is approximately 185 cy.  <br>    <br>  Rounded cobble material will be required for the majority of the material. Between 30,000 to 50,000 cy of material will be placed total in three separate layers. A 2-foot bottom bedding filter consisting of  -inch minus gravels will be placed at foundation grade.  A core material (either angular or rounded) will be placed on top of the bedding and range from 1 to 12 inches in size. Rounded cobble will be placed at the toe of the berm to dissipate wave energy. A final layer of rounded cobble will be placed on top of the core material ranging in size from 1 to 8 inches in size, well graded. The constructed template crest would have a crest height of between 10 to 15 feet above the foundation grade and have a 1 vertical to 5 horizontal slope aspect from crest to existing grade.  <br>    <br>  Once construction is complete, the excavated sand will be placed at the toe of the structure to preserve the existing grade at the time of construction, any remaining sand will be used to supplement low spots in the foredune crest.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).    (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN<br />FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />
<p><br />I. CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION: The contracting organization responsible for this action is the 4th Contracting Squadron, 1695 Wright Brothers Avenue, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC, 27531.</p>
<p>II. DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: The contractual action is a sole source firm-fixed price contract for the purchase and installation of a full back-up Vindicator/VICADS system for the Emergency Communication Center.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: To purchase and install 3 interior 360 degree PIR motion sensors in building 4400, Bay 3 Mezzanine using the existing Vindicator panel. These additional motion sensors support 6 Integrated Aircrew Trainers being moved from building 4517 to building 4400.</p>
<p>IV. AUTHORITY: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1.</p>
<p>V. APPLICABLITY OF AUTHORITY: Request to award this requirement to only one responsible source, Open Roads Inc. In order to install and integrate a new Vindicator alarm system into the already existing Vindicator system on SJAFB a contractor would have to be certified to install Vindicator equipment and have access to the base network and the alarm system head end in order to program the new alarms into the system. Other companies may be certified to install Vindicator equipment, however, they will not be able to obtain access to Seymour Johnson's network due to OPSEC and INFOSEC reasons. Allowing base network access to a company for a single installation comprises Seymour Johnson's OPSEC and INFOSEC reasons. Currently, Open Roads is the only contractor that is both certified to install Vindicator equipment and authorized access to the SJAFB network and the the head end in order to program the alarm system. Additionally, Open Roads is responsible for maintaining the Vindicator alarm system on SJAFB. Therefore, after the Vindicator system is installed, Open Roads will be rsponsible for all periodic and emergency maintenance required for the sytem.</p>
<p>VI. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: Honeywell sells Vindicator equipment, however, neither Honeywell nor their distributors would be able to install it into the VICADS system/software. Open Roads Consulting, Inc. is the only responsible company for this installation.</p>
<p>VII. FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: The Contracting Officer will make a price fair and reasonable determination following the proceedures identified in FAR 13.106-3(a)(2).</p>
<p>VIII. MARKET SURVEY: Open Roads Consulting, Inc. has proprietary rights to all software, software maintenance, and specifications for the existing system for the 4th Fighter Wing and tenant units. There are no other sources that can provide the required instillation services.</p>
<p>IX. OTHER FACTS: None</p>
<p>X. STEPS TO FOSTER COMPETITION: Open Roads Consulting, Inc. holds the Vindicator/VIACADS alarm maintenance and monitoring contract on SJAFB. Market research will be conducted to see what other systems exist when the contract is due for recompetition. If there are other cost effective options at that time the government will explore those alternatives.</p>
<p>XI. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS/PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION: The using activity has certified that the technical requirements are complete and accurate.</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION: The Contracting Officer's signature on the Justification Review Document represents certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge.</p>

<MODNBR>0040
<DESC><p>LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION <br />FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE AWARD (FAR 8.4)</p>
<p>1. Authority:<br />The acquisition was conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule (MAS) Program. The statutory authorities for the MAS program are Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251, et seq.) and Title 40 U.S.C.501, Services for Executive Agencies.</p>
<p>2. Contracting Agency and Activity: <br />NOAA, Acquisition and Grants Office<br />Eastern Acquisition Division - Kansas City Office (EAD)<br />601 E. 12th Street, Room 1756<br />Kansas City, MO 64106</p>
<p>3. Nature and/or description of action being approved: <br />The NOS office has delegated trustee responsibilities under the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA/Superfund), the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990, and implementing Executive Orders and Regulations. In order to support these responsibilities and to assist NOAA with continued efforts to achieve cooperative settlements with potential responsible parties (PRPs), this action is being approved as a modification to GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Contract Number GS-10F-0037R, Task Order Number DG 133C-06-NC-0518 with I.M. Systems Group (IMSG) increasing the estimated ceiling price by $645,000.00 based on calculations from the contractor's monthly "burn rate" (i.e., the monthly average of cost being incurred on the work effort). In addition, this action extends the period of performance for two months from February 1, 2013 through March 31, 2013. This action includes, if needed, two (2) one month option periods, extending the final period of performance to May 31, 2013, to allow EAD enough time to complete award of new contract and complete a successful and seamless transition to a potential new contractor.</p>
<p>4. Description of Supplies or Services required to meet the agency's needs (including estimated value): <br />Task Order DG133C-06-NC-0518 provides ongoing support to NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration (ORR) response, damage assessment, administrative functions, and mission critical work. Services provided under the task order include assisting with prevention and preparedness, response, restoration and protection of coastal habitats and resources from oil spills, hazardous material release, and other activities that could degrade environmental quality. IMSG provides mission critical assistance with formulating policy, long-range strategic plans, research and development and marine debris investigation. The services required are primarily supporting NOAA in the ongoing litigation with BP associated with the Deepwater Horizon Spill in the Gulf of Mexico. These services are currently being re-competed. The proposed ceiling increase and contract extension will provide continuity of services and operations for NOS for two additional months and if needed with two (2) one month options. The estimated dollar value of the action, inclusive of all options, is $645,000.00.</p>
<p>5. The authority and supporting rational and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service:<br />The authority for this action is FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C), in the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to the original Federal Supply Schedule order DG133C-06-NC-0518 which was awarded to IMSG. Moreover, the order was awarded as a result of a competitive acquisition procedure conducted under GSA Federal Supply Schedule. The continuation of services provided by IMSG is vital to supporting the mission of NOS and NOAA's ongoing litigation with BP. An interruption in services, pending award of the new contract, would have a significant impact on the day-to-day operations of NOS and the pending litigation and settlement with BP. OR&amp;R would not be able to provide support to the Technical Work Groups (TWG) with data management needs related to the Deepwater Horizon Natural Resource Damage Assessment activities. Also, NOS would not be capable of supporting the continued maintenance and testing of the Environmental Response Management Application (ERMA), a proven web-based common operational platform that has data stores DWH information. In addition, the inability to provide on-scene scientific support activities and scientific support for operational decisions during oils spills and other emergencies would have significant impacts to OR&amp;R's ability to meet NOAA's mission. These services are currently being re-competed as a commercial service on the open market as a small business set-aside, with an anticipated award date between February 2013, and early March 2013.</p>
<p>6. A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d): The ordering activity has determined that increasing the ceiling price and extending the period of performance represent a best value (as defined by FAR 2.101) and result in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features and administrative costs). Services offered on the contract are priced at fixed price hourly labor rates pursuant to the GSA schedule, less a 4% discount. Furthermore, GSA has already determined that the rates for services offered at hourly rates are fair and reasonable (FAR 8.404(d)).</p>
<p>7. A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted:<br />Market research was collected and analyzed prior to award of task order. The information obtained from schedule holders did demonstrate their capabilities to satisfy NOAA's need. Therefore, the existing task order with IMSG was awarded pursuant to the ordering procedures at FAR 8.405-2. However, this action is required to continue uninterrupted services under this task order pending award of a new contract, and the forthcoming re-compete action will also include market research as required by the FAR. These services are vital to the pending litigation and settlement with BP and must be continued without interruption. At this time, EAD has no other option but to issue a modification to increase this task order ceiling amount and extend services in the interest of economy and efficiency as a short-term bridge to the follow-on competitive acquisition.</p>
<p>8. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made:<br />The increase in the estimated ceiling price and extending the period of performance is necessary to avoid any interruption in performing of mission-critical activities. This action will provide sufficient time for NOAA to compete and award a new contract. These services are currently being re-competed as a commercial service on the open market as a small business set-aside with an anticipated award date between February 2013, and early March 2013. EAD is taking action during re-compete of this requirement, which is scheduled for award between February 2013, and early March 2013, to remove the need for restricted consideration in the future.<br /><br />9. Technical or Requirements Personnel Certification<br />This is to certify that the supporting information which forms the basis for this justification are the responsibility of the undersigned program office personnel and are accurate and complete.<br /><br />___________________________________ ______________<br />Christopher Cartwright Date<br />Chief Financial Officer<br />National Ocean Service</p>
<p>10. The ordering activity contracting officer's certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief:</p>
<p>This is to certify that the Limited Sources Justification has been reviewed and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the information provided to support the rationale and recommendation for approval is accurate and complete.</p>
