<DESC>The current state of the art in materials and structures requires hypersonic weapon systems rely on non-optimum designs. Thermal protection systems can be used to protect underlying lightweight metal structures from the extreme temperatures of hypersonic flight and limit internal temperature. However, this design approach reduces internal volume and leads to a vehicle that is susceptible to handling damage due to the fragility of thermal protection systems. An alternate design approach substitutes heavy super alloys that can withstand the extreme thermal environment of flight. However, this structural configuration adds weight and produces a thermal short to the interior. These limitations, along with other design issues due to the minimum gage material thicknesses that are necessary, limit the design space for metallic designs. It is proposed that a better design for a high speed missile system would be one that utilizes high temperature composites in the vehicle structure. The optimum structural design might be 100 percent composites or some combination of composites and metals. The primary purpose of this program is to explore advanced designs and materials concepts that have the potential to produce affordable light weight vehicle structures.

<SUBJECT>B -- RFI FOR SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNICAL TOOLS
<SOLNBR>R2453
<CONTACT>Sharon  Rowe sharon.rowe@us.af.mil

<a href="mailto:sharon.rowe@us.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG) at Lackland AFB, TX is soliciting comments in response to several questions below.  This RFI is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.
CPSG is developing plans for an AF SCRM Center of Excellence (CoE) to address the supply chain threats as stated in the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative #11: "Develop a multi-pronged approach for global supply chain risk management." The DoD and AF have identified SCRM detection gaps in the following categories: 1) Software, 2) Firmware, and 3) Hardware. Globalization of the commercial Information and Communications Technology (ICT) marketplace provides increased opportunities for penetration of the supply chain by those intent on harming the United States to gain unauthorized access to data, alter data, or interrupt communications. The AF SCRM CoE will be assigned the task of acquiring capabilities to detect SCRM threats and vulnerabilities. CPSG is interested in understanding the capabilities of software and hardware tools available to address the gamut of SCRM challenges. CPSG is interested in hardware and software tools that are commercially available, but!  is also exploring research initiatives that industry is funding, to address this problem area. CPSG is also interested in services that industry may have available to assist in the detection of SCRM vulnerabilities.
Software tools that will eventually be utilized to detect SCRM vulnerabilities must be used on operating systems approved for use within the AF. 
Please provide answers to the following questions. Responses can focus on one or more of the categories listed below.  Responses will be used in market research for any subsequent acquisition.  Responses will be limited to a total of 10-pages, single spaced, 1" margins, with 12-point type. Please send unclassified responses via email no later than 13 July 2010 to:  jeffrey.hardin@us.af.mil.  
For additional information see SCRM RFI document available for downloading.

<DESC>Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) Services providing the full range of supply and technical support for the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) are to be acquired. The ESTS is an intermediate level Automatic Test System (ATS) consisting of the test set and associated Interface Test Adapter (ITA) hardware along with 75 software programs. It is used by the RSAF to maintain 56 F-15 avionics Line Replaceable Units (LRUs). This is a follow-on effort to contract FA8505-06-D-0001 which expires 22 Dec 2010.<br />The contractor shall provide the full range of logistics support to include depot repair of hardware; technical support for fielded stations, resolution of reported software deficiencies, Technical Order (T.O.) management, sustaining engineering and obsolescence program management. The contractor will develop and implement upgrades to add additional test capability or improve station performance and reliability as directed and funded by the customer through the PCO. Maintaining, to the maximum extent possible, a common hardware / software (HW/SW) configuration between the seven RSAF owned stations and the larger USAF ESTS population is of paramount importance for long term supportability and affordability.<br />The ESTS is a highly integrated system consisting of the station and ITA hardware controlled by 75 specialized software programs and requiring over 100 ESTS specific T.0.s. The Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) is the original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the ESTS. They developed and built the stations, wrote the software, produced the technical orders, developed the logistics support strategy, and control the configuration. They have sole access to the total package of engineering data and drawings of the Saudi equipment. They are the only company with a complete set of the software source code for the Saudi unique Test Program Sets (TPSs). Thus they have unique experience and capability as the overall system integrator. The RSAF requirement for a total logistics support concept can currently be met only by the unique ability of NGC to integrate total program requirements.<br />a.

Vaisala Inc. is the sole contractor able to supply the lightning data to the FAA without an interruption of service and the expenditures of inordinate funds. (b)  this sole source procurement will afford the FAA the time necessary to conduct a permanent competitive procurement. 
If you have any questions or comments on this contract action, please contact the Contracting Specialist, Larry Mendelson no later than close of business July 1,2010 at (202) 493-4623 or email at larry.mendelson@faa.gov

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to make notice that the U.S. Forest Service contemplates releasing a solicitation numbered AG-024B-S-10-0008 on or about March 25, 2010 for a large fire cost review. If the solicitation is released, it will be released through this FedBizOpps website, and prospective contractors should the FedBizOpps website on or about 25 March to obtain a copy of the solicitation. All future information about this acquisition will be distributed solely through this website.


Project Description: The contractor will be responsible for bringing together a diverse team with expertise in the areas of wildland fire management, land management, risk management, and wildfire suppression strategies.  The contractor will recruit skilled personnel from other land management and response agencies, and possibly other countries, to review the agencys response to wildfires.  This might include specialists from the military, academia, industry, and emergency agencies for expertise in land management, wildland fire management, risk management, and large field operations involving ground and air assets and catastrophic threats to the public. 

The contractor will coordinate and oversee the work of the Independent Panel. The panel is tasked with examining and reporting on fire suppression costs for wildfire incidents during Fiscal Year 2009 where federal expenditures exceeded $10,000,000.  The panels purpose will be to determine if the agency exercised fiscal diligence in managing specific incident suppression activities.  This panel is not expected to complete an exhaustive fiscal audit of all incident phases.  Rather, the focus will be on evaluating how these large fires were managed.   The Review objectives for this years panel should focus, as possible, on the following areas:

Evaluating the risk-based management of these large fires from a systems standpoint  from planning and decision-making through implementation and the outcomes that resulted.  For each of these stages, people, skills, and technology should be assessed and what in the system worked well and what in the system needs to be improved should be identified.

Assessing the utilization of new processes, guidance, expectations and tools that have changed the business of fire management in recent years in an effort to determine the impact these changes have had and develop a baseline for comparison in future years as these efforts mature.

Determining whether the agencys current review process is yielding positive changes and identifying ways to improve the agencys current fire review processes.

If the panel finds instances where the agency may not have executed prudent fiscal decisions with respect to public/firefighter safety, natural resource, and private property protection, estimate the proportions of appropriate and excess suppression costs (recognizing that excess costs would be earmarked for return to the treasury based on end of fiscal year 2009 balances). 

Summarize findings in a report to the Secretary of Agriculture.


Participation: This project is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this acqusition is 541620. The small business size standard is $7.0 million average income over the last three years.

<DESC>The Forest Service radio sites to be fueled are remote and typically only accessible by helicopter. There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season. Typical transportation of propane to these sites will include the use of a helicopter. The full "liquid out" tanks are transported to a staging area and then slung to the remote site by a helicopter rated for that load. A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane from the tank to standard 500 gallon propane tanks. This process is repeated until all the tanks are at maximum capacity. This is a high priority communication system that must be kept operational at all times to facilitate employee and aircraft coordination and tracking.

The intent of the Forest Service is to procure a design for the remodeling of the interior of this warehouse that allows specific equipment to be relocated out of the main office and provide secure outdoor storage area between the two existing warehouses. The design will serve as preparation of Conceptual Design Documents, Preliminary Design Documents, Construction Documents, and Engineering Services during Construction for the construction of the PNW Research Station - La Grande Lab, Warehouse Expansion &amp; Office Remodel Project.</p>
<p>The PNW La Grande Lab is located at 1401 Gekeler Lane, La Grande in Union County, Oregon. The PNW La Grande Lab warehouse has 1200 existing square feet.

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement to implement therestructuring of the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System(NPOESS).  The existing program was managed through a tri-agency organization. Thisgovernance is being eliminated, and the primary responsibility for meteorological andclimate data collection by the afternoon orbit satellites now resides with the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration (NASA).	These satellites will provide civil weather forecasting andclimate data through a program now called the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS).  Thistransition includes assuming responsibility for the in-process builds for fourinstruments and a ground system along with the need for a spacecraft. NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole source procurement or a non-competitive delivery orderunder the Rapid Spacecraft Acquisition contract to Ball Aerospace and TechnologiesCorporation (BATC) for a BCP 2000 spacecraft to be launched no later than 2014.The intent of the restructure directed by the Executive Office of the President was totransfer, to a NASA management structure, the existing complement of afternoon orbitinstruments and ground system, along with the provision of suitable spacecraft, asdetermined jointly by NASA and NOAA, to carry these instruments in the afternoon orbit. This spacecraft will serve as a back-up and replacement for, and would utilize the sameinstruments and same ground system as the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) spacecraft. NPP was originally intended as a technology demonstration mission.  However, delays inthe NPOESS program have resulted in NPP being used as an operational gap-fillermission.  Since NPP was never intended to be an operational spacecraft there is someconcern as to its life expectancy.  Therefore NASA has determined that the only availablecourse of action that meets the requirement to reduce the risk of a coverage gap in thecase of any premature failures of the NPP or its instruments is to procure, on a solesource basis, a suitable spacecraft, designated JPSS-1, that can be launched withoutunreasonable delay and carry the same suite of instruments as NPP.  NOAA and NASA havedetermined that effectively mitigating the risks associated with NPP requires the launchof the JPSS-1 as early as possible, no later than 2014.  NASA has determined that theonly suitable spacecraft is a BATC BCP 2000 spacecraft bus, as it is the only spacecraftthat can be launched and placed into service at a date sufficiently early to providemeaningful mitigation of this risk.  Award to any other source would cause unacceptabledelays in fulfilling the agencys requirements to ensure data continuity for weather andstorm forecasting.Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)  Only OneResponsible Source.  However, any organization that believes they can provide these itemswithout any detrimental impact to the program mission should fully identify theirinterest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of the synopsis.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform anyof these efforts in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 2:00 pm ESTon July 12, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the Government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to award a non-competitive Interim Contract with Four Seasons Environmental, Inc, 43 New Garver Road, Monroe, OH, 45050 for the period of 07/01/2010-12/31/2010, for maintenance and repair (O&M) of HVAC systems, building structures, and other systems required for the continuous operation of the Atlanta Tax Submissions Processing Center, 4800 Buford Hwy, Chamblee, GA. 

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The NAICS is 561210, and Small Business Size Standard is 35.5M annual receipts.

Preparation of the solicitation for a new long term contract for this service has begun, however the follow-on contract action is not yet ready to be awarded and the services required must be maintained without disruption. Continuity of the services is imperative for the reasons explained below and therefore, this bridge contract is issued for the period of 07/01/2010 through 12/31/2010 pending award of a new contract effective 01/01/2011.

The current O&M Contractor, Four Seasons Environmental, Inc has performed the O&M services for over five years at this location and has the expertise and experience to provide the necessary uninterrupted services. By awarding to another Contractor the Government runs the risk of having an IRS tax return processing center shutdown at the busiest time of the year, since a new contractor will require time to become familiar with the building systems, their operation, and maintenance.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers. No solicitation document is available. Interested parties may submit their interest and ability to meet IRS needs. However, responses received as a result of this notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by IRS not to open this requirement to competition based upon any written responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of IRS. Responses are due by 05/12/2010, 2:00 PM EST. For information regarding this notice, contact Pellumbeshe Hoxhaj, Contract Specialist, via fax: 404-338-9231 or e-mail: pellumbeshe.hoxhaj@irs.gov by e-mail. Telephone inquiries will not be honored or acknowledged.

<DESC>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Kennedy Space Center (KSC) hasa requirement for 21, 30-gallon drums of Dibrom 14 to control mosquitoes in outlyingareas of KSC, where the use of aerial equipment is necessary to apply chemicals to areasimpossible to spray without an aircraft. Dibrom 14 is supplied annually by KSC to theBrevard County Mosquito Control District (BCMCD) in accordance with the Mosquito ControlAgreement between KSC, Air Force Eastern Test Range, US Fish and Wildlife Service(USFWS), and Brevard County. AMVAC Chemical Corporation, the manufacturer of Dibrom 14,has verified that Adapco, Incorporated of Sanford, Florida is the sole distributor ofthis product for the state of Florida. Other authorized distributors are prohibited fromdistributing the product beyond their state or assigned territory. KSC intends topurchase the 21, 30-gallon drums of Dibrom 14 from Adapco, Incorporated of Sanford,Florida. Dibrom 14 is an adulticide used to control mosquitoes. There are several areasat the Launch Pads and Launch Complex 39, where normal chemicals used at KSC cannot besprayed due to chemical corrosiveness and flight hardware. Moreover, these areas are alsovery large and impossible to spray without an aircraft, which KSC does not possess. TheMosquito Control Agreement provides the equipment (aircraft) to spray large areas ofwater in the KSC area to control mosquitoes without having to spray directly around thelaunch pads. KSC procures and supplies the Dibrom 14 to BCMCD for spraying. Dibrom 14 isthe only chemical that can be used, because it is the only chemical BCMCD is licensed tospray in the KSC and impound areas.

Evaluation Factor 6.  Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of their extent to identify and commit to Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone Small Business (HUBZoneSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and if applicable, Historically Black Colleges or Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) in performance of this contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor. The Government will evaluate proposals based on two elements: a) Past performance in utilization of small business concerns, and (b) Participation of small business concerns for this requirement.  In support of element (a), all offerors shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, VOSB, SDVOSB and HBCU/MI.  Large Business offerors shall submit three "final" or "most recent" Individual Subcontracting Reports (ISRs) for similar contracts of relative size which show compliance with utilizing the various types of small business firms noted above. If subcontracting goals were not met, provide an explanation.  If Individual Subcontracting Reports were not applicable to the similar contracts noted, large business offerors shall submit other documentation which shows their utilization of the various types of small business firms for the contracts. Small Business offerors shall also submit documentation which shows their utilization of the various types of small business firms for similar contracts of relative size.  In support of element (b), large businesses shall submit a draft Small Business Subcontracting Plan, in which they will be evaluated on the extent to which they identify and commit to the published Small Business Subcontracting Program.  The Secretary of the Navy has assigned the Naval Facilities Engineering Command goals for FY2010 in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars for utilization of small businesses.  Demonstrate the plan to meet these goals:  Small Business (SB) - 65.65%, HUBZone (HUB) - 1.37%, Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SBD) - 16.27%, Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB) - 14.68%, Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) - 3%, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) - 3%.  If a large business firm is selected for award, a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 19.6 and DFAR 219.7 will be required and incorporated into the contract award.  A draft Small Business Subcontracting Plan is not required from small business offerors; however, small business offerors shall submit similar information on the extent to which they identify and commit to subcontracting to large business (LB), SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, VOSB, SDVOSB, and HBCU/MI if applicable in the performance of this contract.
Evaluation Factor 7.  Firm Location:  Firms will be evaluated on geographic location and knowledge of primary geographic areas serviced by this contract (provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract).  Describe proposed location of the program management office and other office locations and how this will be advantageous to the Government.
Evaluation Factor 8.  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.  Firms should state the amount of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD within the past 12 months; if a joint venture, figures should be given for the joint venture as a whole and for individual joint venture partners. In evaluating volume of work, the Government may consider information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and other publicly available sources.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541519   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Facilities Management and Services Division (FMSD) under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Reules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to SCLogic, LLC forpurchase of a mail and package barcode and signature tracking system.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. The SLCIntra tracking system is the only system that can meed all of EPA's needs and requirements. SCLIntra is Section 508 Compliant, is the only local vendor that is able to send factory technicians within a one-hour time frame for technical support and on-site installation. In addition, SCLIntra is able to be configured by US EPA employees, without vendor intervention to conform to the unique delivery process used by EPA. The configurations include screen and label designs, and can support an unlimited number of user groups - with each function of the software able to be turned on or off for each user or group. Additionally, ad-hoc reports are able to be saved by login name, and all fields are able to be confugred by name - all requirements for the EPA system that are met by SCLIntra. Lastly,  the mobile delivery devices use a Secure Digital card to both store the applciation and the delivery data. The SD cards are removable and in the event of device failure, can be installed into a replacement drive. SCLogic is the only vendor that provdides this safety feature. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herin may submit a response, which if received by the closing date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this post must be sent via email to the Contract Specialist listed below. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Trina Fisher via email at Fisher.Trina@epa.gov no later than 4:00 pm EST of the closing date of this announcement. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

The first task involves performing routine maintenance, such as inspecting connectors, ordering replacement parts, and installing the replacement parts to insure that the AMRFC/MFEW facility is maintained in normal working order. The second task involves performing major modifications, such as disassembling and re-assembling the transmit or receive pallets. The third task involves performing minor modifications such as adding or moving antennas, adding new cable and connectors, mounting new equipment, adding modified weldments, modification of components and preparing and painting all or any part of the facility. The contractor shall provide field work and a design and modification facility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="COLOR: black">Oceaneering was the winning offeror in a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) to manufacture the eight shelters of AMRFC to government specifications in 2003. They were also contracted to perform the development, manufacturing and installation of the AMRFC Facility. They assisted NRL in the development, manufacture and installation of the power system, the coolant system and the dry air system from procurement through set-up and check out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oceaneering has developed manufacturing techniques, tooling and many proprietary fixtures for work on the conexes. This knowledge and special tooling has saved NRL many manhours and dollars in the modification, remanufacture, and installation of parts and equipment, some of which has had to be done in the past 7 years at AMRFC/MFEW. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>The two container MFEW systems presented various challenges to NRL and Oceaneering in development, manufacturing and installation of the third floor of the AMRFC/MFEW. Oceaneering manufactured and installed the infrastructure under a previous contract with NRL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NRL next issued a full and open competitive requirement for maintenance of the entire facility in 2008 against which Oceaneering was the only offeror. Because of the unique and specialized manufacturing techniques, tools, and fixtures required for maintenance of the facility, no other offeror submitted a technically sound proposal to satisfy the Government's requirement. Since issuance of the 2008 contract, Oceaneering has continued to modify and improve these specialized skills which are still required in the performance of this current requirement. Oceaneering has gained a thorough knowledge and understanding of the unique attributes of the AMRFC/MFEW facility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Their experience with and knowledge of the facility and the CBD environment, enables them to provide necessary support in both breadth and depth of endeavor, which is frequently needed on a long term or emergency basis. </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Based on review of other facilities within proximity of the CBD that may be capable of performing the required services, none possess the space, equipment, manpower or unique knowledge of the facility to perform the job on a 24/7 basis. Because of Oceaneering's proximity to the CBD, they have been able to provide the necessary emergency support as necessary. Severe storms and freezing temperature has wreaked havoc on the facility through the years. Oceaneering has had to make emergency trips outside regular work hours to the site to repair support equipment and on occasion has removed the conexes to its indoor facility for repair on an emergency basis. </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website <a href="http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.">http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.</a></span>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:The U.S. Geological Survey has a requirement for the following:
STATEMENT OF WORK ARTICLE I: Scope The contractor will provide water well drilling services for the u.s. Geological Survey (USGS) at a site in Chesterfield County, South Carolina (fig. 1). This work is part of a larger project investigating the groundwater resources and groundwater quality of Chesterfield County. ARTICLE II: Statement of Work: A. General Description 1.	The on-site driller will be licensed by the State of South Carolina as a well driller. All work will conform to applicable state and local regulations regarding well drilling and installation. Specifically, South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC), South Carolina Well Standards R.61-71, effective April 26, 2002 will be followed. The contractor will acquire all required state or local licenses and permits to perform the work before any field operations begin. 2.	All work shall be completed within 30 days of notice to proceed and according to the attached schedule. 3.	Site Utilities: The contractor will be responsible for providing any needed utility service such as electrical and water service. Electrical service and potable water are not available at the drilling site. The contractor will be responsible for having the site checked for any underground utilities by the appropriate entity. 4.	The USGS will provide an on-site representative to monitor progress and provide technical assistance to the contractor as necessary. 
B. Detailed Requirements 1. Sites descriptions The drilling site is located in the Coastal Plain physiographic province in the Peedee River basin, South Carolina (SC) in Chesterfield County near McBee, SC (figs. 1 and 2). Two zones within the unconfined Middendorf aquifer underly the site. The unsaturated zone is throught to be approximately 120 feet thick but there are no nearby wells to verify this. The site is located adjacent to Lake Robinson on property owned by Alligator Rural Water and Sewer, Inc (ARWS). A site visit by potential bidders is encouraged. 2. On-site work: 
The contractor shall supply capable and experienced personnel and suitable drilling equipment to perform this work. The specific drilling method will be selected by the contractor and approved by the USGS Technical Representative. Whatever drilling method is selected, the contractor will use as little drilling fluid additives as possible. Detailed written records of any drilling fluid additives used during the work will be kept and provided to the USGS. The drill rig, all down-hole rods, bits and tools, and all pumps will be cleaned off-site before use on-site. Required safety equipment shall be used by the drilling crew while working under this contract. The work shall be performed according to all applicable federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration standards. 
3. Site Security: The drill site shall be secured to discourage unauthorized entry when no work is taking place. The well shall be protected at all times during construction. When work is not taking place inside the well bore, it shall be protected by means of a cover. 4. Well Depth: The depth of the well is expected to be approximately 400-ft below land surface. Nearby ARWS production wells are: Well 3 -395 ft deep; Well 8 --360 deep; Well 10 -357 ft to top of rock. 
The total drilling depth is unknown but will continue until hard rock is reached or the 420 ft depth below land surface is reached. 
4. Well Construction and Materials: The objective of the well is to allow continuous monitoring of the groundwater level within the aquifer at the site, to allow detailed sampling at discrete depths within the aquifer, and to allow for the acquisition of geophysical logs (all of which will be done by the USGS after well completion). All materials and products installed as part of the well will be provided by the contractor and will consist of4-inch (in.) diameter schedule 80 threaded polyvinyl chloride (PVC) casing and screen, stainless steel screen, cement (ASTM CI50, Type 1), filter material, and 100% pure sodium bentonite (montmorillonite) -powdered, granular, pelletized, or chipped, and a steel, lockable well cover. General: The contractor shall drill the well at the exact location designated by the USGS. The contractor shall use appropriate drilling equipment to drill the hole and shall install the materials described below so that the finished well conforms to the general design in Figure 3. The driller will clean the site after the well is completed, disposing of any trash or unused materials. If any mud pits are dug, the contractor will backfill and compact them returning the land surface to its original grade. 
The well will be a hybrid material type well. There will be 2 screen strings specified, with the deeper screen composed of continuous-slot wire wrapped stainless steel and the upper screen composed of machine cut PVC. The purpose of this hybrid design will be to maximize well integrity at this depth. Placement of the screen strings will be decided after geophysical logs are run in the mud-filled borehole. 
1.	Hole diameter: The diameter of the drilled hole shall have a minimum of 1.5 inches on all sides of the casing/screen to allow for forced injection grout and the placement of the filter pack through a tremie pipe. 2.	Drilling fluid: The driller shall record any fluid additives used including time of introduction. Only inorganic drilling fluid made with beneficiated bentonite additives such as Quick-Gel or equal or a food grade guar-gum polymer such as Revert or equivalent shall be used. Any other additives must be approved by the on-site USGS representative. 3.	Grout: The monitoring well annular space above the filter pack shall be grouted from bottom to top. The grout will be emplaced from the top of the bentonite seal to the land surface and shall conform to the monitoring well requirements listed in SCDHEC South Carolina Well Standards (R.61-71). Grout is to be composed of a high solids sodium bentonite grout. 4.	Bentonite: The material shall be 100% pure sodium bentonite (montmorillonite) and be powdered, granular, pelletized or chipped. 5.	Casing: Shall be nominal4-in diameter, threaded, PVC schedule 80 manufactured from virgin resin, Type 1, Grade 1, PVC compound with a cell classification of 12454-B per American Society Testing and Materials (ASTM) D1784 standards for potable water. All materials must be NSF approved, and in strict compliance with ASTM D1785. All joints shall be waterproof. No glue joints or solvents will be permitted. The casing shall extend 36 inches above land surface. 6.	Well screen: The two 20-ft long (40-ft total) screen strings shall be 316 stainless steel and be of the continuous slot design. It shall be constructed of vee-shaped trapezoidal wire continuously wrapped around an array of equally spaced rods of the same material. All joints shall be waterproof. The screen shall have machine produce openings and not be hand cut. The slot size shall be capable of retaining at least 90 percent of the filter pack material. A 2-3 foot long section of blank casing shall extend below the bottom of the lower screen and a threaded cap shall be placed at the bottom of this casing. 7.	Filter pack: The annular space surrounding the screen shall the filled with a well sorted silica-based sand. The filter pack material shall be hard and durable and have an average specific gravity of not less than 2.50. The filter pack shall be visibly free of clay, dust, and organic matter. 
8.	Well development: The well development process shall remove native silts and clays and drilling fluid       residues deposited on the borehole face and in adjacent portions of the aquifer during the drilling process. The objective of the well development process is to assure maximum specific capacity of the well. The well development procedure will be selected by the contractor but will not be done with an air compressor due to the potential to collapse the well screen. Well development will be considered complete when the water discharged by the well is representative of the ground water contained in the aquifer. After well development is finished, the contractor shall determine the total well depth. If more than 5 feet of material has collected at the bottom of the well, the contractor will be required to remove it from the well. 9.	Well Completion: After the well is completed, a 24-inch square by 6-inch thick concrete pad shall be poured at land surface. A lockable, steel, protective well cover will be set into the concrete pad by the driller. The cover shall be a Square Lockable wI E-Z Access Sliding Lid or equivalent. 10.	Geophysical logging: After the hole is drilled to depth, the drilling contractor will make the mud-filled borehole available to the USGS for the collection of borehole geophysical logs for approximately 4 hours. Access to the drill hole will be returned to the drilling contractor as soon as possible.   
5. Records: The contractor shall submit all required information to SCDHEC regarding well construction. The SCDHEC Water Well Record Form 1903 will be provided to the USGS upon completion of the wells. 6. Completion of Work: The contractor will complete the work described herein within 30 days after being given a notice to proceed.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The government reserves the right to hold discussions during the process of product standardization.  In addition, the government reserves the right to cancel this standardization action in its entirety if indicated.

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 4:00 PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer. 

Emails and correspondence may be sent to jquinn8@live.com

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1.	The drip chamber is clear and allows visualization of drops 
	a. Promotes accurate drip rate to deliver proper amount of fluid/drug prescribed
	b. Evaluator will assess by filling drip chamber and visualizing drops
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
2.	The IV tubing is pliable and is memory free 
	a. Promotes an accurate and timely amount of medication and volume of fluid delivered 	during patient mobility/change in position.
	b. Evaluator will assess by bending and attempting to crimp the tubing
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
3.	IV tubing allows an effective priming speed, flow rate and stopcock function
	a. Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to prime tubing with fluid in an urgent 	care setting for patient care needs.
	b. Evaluator will assess by assembling and utilizing IV set (to include stop cock)
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
4.	The buretrol (or volutrol) graduation allows visualization of an accurate volume level
	a. Promotes an accurate amount of medication and volume of fluid 	delivered to prevent 	fluid overload when indicated.
	b. Evaluator will assess by filling drip chamber and visualizing volume level
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
5.	Product item package identifies the type of IV tubing set 
	a. Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to select the appropriate size for patient 	care needs
	b. Evaluator will assess by visualizing product item packaging
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor [The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.

Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

THE CLOSING DATE IS 19 APRIL 2010 4PM EST.

A.	 General Information

The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Digital Thermometers (Oral and Rectal) with Probe Covers. 

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The government reserves the right to hold discussions during the process of product standardization.  In addition, the government reserves the right to cancel this standardization action in its entirety if indicated.

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing at the conclusion of this process.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Digital Thermometers (Oral and Rectal) with Probe Covers. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  At a minimum, a complete product line includes, but is not limited to, the functional equivalent in all sizes of the following products listed:  A. Digital Thermometers with an oral probe and rectal probe  B. Probe covers for Digital Thermometers
Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature (in electronic format)   in response to this RFQ.
2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Digital Thermometers (Oral and Rectal) with Probe Covers product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
3.	Vendors must have, or be obtaining, a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Owens and Minor) for distribution in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
4.	Vendors must agree to submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  
5.	Vendors must provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address of local vendor representative for the Mid-Atlantic Region. 
6.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or FDA or company recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the product line including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals. 
7.	Vendors must have a return goods policy, and should provide a copy of the policy (in electronic format) with the initial submittal responding to this RFQ. 
8.	Vendors must provide customer service (telephonic, onsite, website or email) for regional facilities.  Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the initial submittal.
9.	Vendors are required to provide the brands your company manufactures and/or distributes.
10.	Vendors must agree that, when requested, they will provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and competitive product cross reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format 


Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process:

Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who have met the technical/company criteria will progress to the clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples and literature concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. 

Clinical Evaluation Process

For those companies that meet the requirements above, the TRBO office, on behalf of the CPT, will request product samples and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), seven (7) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

The samples to be provided will include as a minimum, but not limited to, the functional equivalent of the following products listed:  A. Digital Thermometers with an oral probe and rectal probe  B. Probe covers for Digital Thermometers

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for seven (7) calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1.	Temperature reading displays on machine within 10 seconds.
a. Allows user to get a quick and accurate reading.
b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting.
c. Allows user to evaluate assessment of health status.
2.	 Temperature display is easy to read.
a. Temperature display is large, bright and clear.
b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting.	
c. Allows user to note reading immediately after display.
3.	 Probe has secure storage when not in use.
a   Storing probe properly avoids contamination.
b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting.
c. The user will store the probe securely.
4.	 Probe cover fits securely to probe for use.
a. Secure fit is necessary to reduce risk of cross contamination.	
b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting.
c. User will test to see if probe cover is secure.

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given seven (7) calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), seven (7) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.

Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

THE CLOSING DATE IS July 6, 2010 4PM EST.

The principal components of the work to be performed include:  
BackgroundThe December 19, 2000 Record of Decision (ROD) for the Trinity River Mainstem Fishery Restoration Environmental Impact Statement/Impact Report (EIS/EIR) directed the Department of Interior to undertake an innovative and system-oriented approach to recovering the River's anadromous fish populations.  The Trinity River Restoration Program (TRRP) was established to restore the attributes found in natural alluvial river systems on a managed river downstream of a dam.  A combination of mechanical rehabilitation, sediment management, a naturalized flow release schedule, and adaptive environmental assessment and management (AEAM) will be used to reverse the impacts caused by decades of flow diversion on one of California's most significant rivers.  In addition to recovery of naturally-spawning anadromous fish populations in the Trinity River, the TRRP also presents a unique opportunity to advance scientific understanding of managed river systems and the recovery processes of natural systems for broader application.
The increase in aquatic and riparian habitat complexity predicted to result from implementation of localized site rehabilitation efforts, cumulative alluvial effects, and ROD flows are expected to benefit wildlife. Riparian and riverine birds were chosen as target species for monitoring wildlife responses to changes because they are good integrators of riparian and river condition, and can respond rapidly (1-2 years) to changes in habitat, while also serving as indicators of long-term (5-20 years) cumulative effects. The riverine wildlife have co-adapted with fish in response to a dynamic alluvial river system, respond to local habitat conditions for breeding success and survival, and are considered an easy and cost-effective wildlife community for monitoring. 
Objective The purpose of this project is to maintain environmental compliance within California's Department of Fish and Game regulations, at a minimum.  This project will facilitate in determining the sampling level of effort required to accurately measure wildlife population changes in response to site rehabilitation implementation, flows, gravel augmentation, habitat development, and other management actions. 
This project will also provide longer term evaluation of changes in wildlife abundance and productivity as progress is made towards Program goals, as stated in the ROD and other supporting documents and legislation, to maintain and restore fish and wildlife populations. The project will also assist in evaluating success in establishing the amount and characteristics of riparian habitat that meet the needs of wildlife species for successful survival and reproduction.
Wildlife studies will also provide input to site designs, provide feedback through monitoring on the success of combined restoration designs and flow schedules to create wildlife habitat and achieve predicted wildlife responses, provide input into flow decisions, particularly flow timing, as well as provide input into large woody debris management.

<p>1. Description:</p>
<p>1.1 Strategy Directorate - Plans Division, an organization of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) is seeking industry interest and information for on-line foreign language proficiency training. Ideally that training will include cultural and regional content to prepare DSCA employees for non-operational assignments overseas or work with partner country personnel in the United States. Training scenarios based in an interactive, avatar context are desired, but not required. Foreign language proficiency training should include the capability to train in reading, writing, speaking, and listening modalities for languages such as: Arabic, Chinese, Persian Farsi, French, Pashto, Hindi, Korean, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, Portuguese, Swahili, Thai, Vietnamese, Urdu, Cambodian, Czech, Georgian, Hebrew, Tagalog and Indonesian. On-line training programs using speech recognition software would facilitate speech training. Administration of agency on-line training should be centrally managed via an on-line learning management system (LMS). Trainees should be able to access on-line training using usernames and passwords issued by the DSCA training manager. When certain levels of training and testing are completed, the foreign language, regional, and cultural content programs should provide the trainer with the ability to printout training certificates to document the level of training achieved.</p>
<p>1.2 Preliminary market research indicates that two foreign language proficiency training products have the potential to meet some, but not all of DSCA training requirements. These two products are Rosetta Stone and Transparent Language CL-150.</p>
<p>2.0 Background:</p>
<p>2.1 In accordance with DoDD 5160.41E, Defense Language Program, it is DoD policy that foreign language and regional expertise be considered critical competencies essential to the DoD mission and shall be managed to maximize the accession, development, maintenance, enhancement, and employment of these critical skills appropriate to the Department of Defense's mission needs. Additionally, the study, maintenance, and employment of skills in critical [foreign] languages by DoD personnel shall be encouraged with provision for special pay and time for self-managed and classroom maintenance and enhancement of [foreign] language skills in continuing education programs, when authorized by law. DoDI 5160.41E requires DSCA to understand the organization's [foreign] language needs and establish appropriate levels of [foreign] language expertise. To these ends, DSCA will deliver web-based online foreign language proficiency training for use by DSCA employees. The desired endstate is a workplace environment that encourages initial and sustainment foreign language proficiency training by providing employees with foreign language proficiency improvement opportunities.</p>
<p>2.2 Limitations: None</p>
<p>2.3 Security Requirements: The contractor needs to be able to work with the DSCA Information Technology team and provide technical support to a controlled, but unclassified LAN system and DSCA employees to resolve technical issues due to training problems encountered on-line, but not on DSCA's unclassified LAN system.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information:</p>
<p>3.1. Explain how new content is made compatible with older operating system versions.</p>
<p>3.2. Specify which operating systems are compatible with vendor training services and list other minimum computer system requirements.</p>
<p>3.3. Identify all foreign languages, regional and cultural content offered and scheduled to be offered. Specify training limitations to language modalities (i.e. listening, reading, writing, speaking).</p>

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), a Primary Level Field Activity of the Defense Logistics Agency, is the DoD Class III Bulk Executive Agent responsible for all bulk petroleum supply management for source of supply to the point of customer acceptance.  DESC is the centralized procurement agency for DoD fuel requirements and handles product transportation to the product point of sale.   DESC also is responsible for product inventory and sales transaction accounting, product quality assurance, and administers a robust Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) and environmental remediation program for capitalized sites.   

Part I:  SHORT TERM OBJECTIVE

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The Government seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information regarding possible suppliers of bio-derived alternative fuel for aviation purposes, and potentially for marine diesel, for delivery to various locations in the state of Hawaii.  The fuel will be for operational use and as such must meet the applicable specification for either:
1)	Hydrotreated Renewable Jet (HRJ) for both HRJ8 and HRJ5, and Hydrotreated Renewable Marine Diesel, HRF76 or;
2)	Fischer-Tropsch Jet for both FTJ8 and FTJ5, and Fischer-Tropsch Marine Diesel FTF76, where the feedstock for the FT process must be biomass.
 The Department of Defense (DoD) is investigating the feasibility of meeting up to 25% of its current estimated requirements for aviation and marine diesel fuels in Hawaii with renewable fuels.  The current estimated annual requirements for DoD in Hawaii are 78,550,000 gallons of JP8, 7,180,000 gallons of JP5, and 42,250,000 gallons of F76.  There is also a smaller quantity of commercial diesel fuel purchased for use in Hawaii, equating to approximately 750,000 gallons per year.  Please note that the 25% goal represents the bio-fuel quantity of the blended 50-50 bio-derived and petroleum derived product.  Delivery dates are to be determined and will be based on availability of an approved specification to purchase against, completed testing and certification of necessary weapon system platforms, and information received from interested sources concerning timeframes for their abilities to meet the necessary quantities and quality.

Part II:  LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE

DoD is interested in long-term prospects for the manufacture and supply of aviation biofuels and marine diesel biofuels in increasing quantities, potentially from multiple suppliers and feedstock sources, to foster an assured domestic supply of these fuels through a healthy industry with sustainable, ongoing competition.  DoD intends to purchase bio-derived jet and marine diesel fuels which meet approved specifications, meet the provisions of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) Section 526, are a drop in fuel that can utilize existing infrastructure, are delivered to DoD fully blended (50:50 blend ratio with conventional petroleum product counterpart (JP8, JP5 or F76) and ready for use.  Cost competitiveness with conventional petroleum derived fuels is a key objective.  To comply with EISA 526, the bio-derived fuels must have lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions that are less than or equal to those of conventional petroleum derived fuels.  All potential providers of bio-derived fuels must comply with all applicable federal, state, local environmental laws and regulations.

PROCESS

This request is to gather information from interested parties and is an essential step in determining market interest for the manufacture and supply of bio-derived aviation and marine diesel fuels.  In order to minimize costs to potentially interested parties and to the Government, this notice is issued to determine market interest and feasibility as well as determine market strategies for production of bio-derived aviation fuels.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead.  The statement of interest must not exceed 20 pages.  The statement shall include, at a minimum, the following information:  (1) product quality  ability to meet anticipated specifications as understood at this time (including identification of any issues or concerns), (2) Current (if any) and future production capabilities, (3) location of production capabilities or plans to build, including ability to finance, (4) quantities that can be produced and when it can be made available, to include anticipated time necessary from contract award to delivery of product, and plans (if any) to supply commercial aviation or diesel fuels in addition to military specification products, (5) type, growth and processing location of feedstock contemplated for use, (6) capability and experience in the sale and delivery of aviation fuels, (7) distribution methods available from the production facility, (8) a description of your contemplated end to end supply chain including plans for the blending of the biofuel component with the conventional petroleum products and final delivery to DoD, and any partnerships contemplated to provide fuel and contracting party with DESC, (9) financial capabilities necessary to meet criteria for award of a supply contract, (10) estimated start-up cost to begin production of bio-derived jet and marine diesel  fuels including scale of production, (11) estimated cost, variable and fixed, of producing a gallon of fuel, and anticipated pricing structure to sell a 50:50 blended gallon of fuel (12) understanding of Federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulation, and familiarity and experience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations for applicable states and U.S Environmental Protection Agency Regions, and (13) corporate requirements for contract lengths and any other contract terms considered critical by your company, and (14) company point of contact, telephone number, and email address.  In addition to the aforementioned mandatory elements, you are encouraged to provide input on potential market indicators that could be utilized to allow economic price adjustments during the contract period-of-performance.  Interested parties should also provide comments on the nature and level of Federal and State incentives and/or obligations (e.g. R&D, capital investment, investment or production incentives) needed to develop and sustain long-term domestic commitments to produce bio-derived fuels.  These may include use of existing programs, such as those administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or other incentives or programs not currently available which would be necessary for successful project development.

This RFI is in support of the U.S. Pacific Commands (PACOM) Green Initiative for Fuels Transition Pacific (GIFTPAC).  The GIFTPAC group is comprised of various different organization including Organizations from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Navy, the U.S Air Force, the U.S. Army, and the U.S. Marine Corps, the Department of Energy, US Department of Agriculture and the State of Hawaii. The goal is to displace at least 25% of the petroleum derived fuels used by the DoD in Hawaii with green fuels.  The initiative supports PACOM energy security requirements by developing domestic organic capability to diminish reliance on outside sources of supply and provide support to the military services stated alternative fuel goals and objectives.    DESC is the Acquisition Manager for this effort.  Other similar efforts are currently in process.  DESC and the Air Transport Association (ATA) recently concluded a Strategic Alliance in an effort to spur the commercial viability of alternative aviation fuels.  Market engagements through this cooperative effort are forthcoming and interested parties are encouraged to check for further information on this site, the DESC webpage, and the ATA webpage in the coming months.

DoD plans to hold a presolicitation conference to answer questions, seek additional information, and help establish the best market engagement strategy possible to ensure success in meeting the aggressive DoD goals of displacing large quantities of conventional petroleum derived aviation fuels with domestic renewable fuels.  The date for presolicitation conference is tentatively set for September 3rd to coincide with the Asia Pacific Clean Energy Summit and Expo to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii from August 30  September 2, 2010.  Please note the presolicitation conference is not part of, nor connected to, the Asia Pacific Clean Energy Summit.  Additional details on the presoliciation conference will be posted on the DESC website (www.desc.dla.mil) and as supplemental information under this RFI.

<a href="mailto:brandon.powell@hq.doe.gov">Powell, Brandon D</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Energy Information Administration (EIA), Office of Integrated Analysis and Forecasting (OIAF), Oil and Gas Division, intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source contract with the Purvin & Gertz, Inc. for a 3-year subscription to the "U.S. and World Petroleum Refining Forecasts and Reports, 2010-2013.". The contract proposed period of performance is 08/03/2010 ? 08/02/2013.
The specific reports that the contractor is responsible to provide include: The specific reports include "North American NGL Industry Outlook," "Global Petroleum Market Outlook," "World LPG Outlook," and "Crude Oil and Oils Sands Market Outlook."
Based on years of review by EIA of internally consistent and comprehensive data and outlooks focused on the petroleum refining sector, the EIA?s Office of Integrated Analysis and Forecasting (OIAF), Energy Markets and End Use (EMEU) and Office of Oil and Gas (OOG) have all determined that highly valuable insights into current, near-term future and longer term projections of domestic and world refining operations are unique and can only be obtained from the Purvin & Gertz reports and are not available from any other source at that same level of detail and coverage. 
The value of this effort is estimated to be $190,000.
The specific exemption to the Act allowing this action is 41 U.S.C 253(.c)(1), which allows an executive agency of the federal government to acquire property or services from one responsible source to satisfy the agency needs; the applicable authority is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1)  as implemented by FAR6.302-1(a) (2)(ii).  
The finding by EIA?s subject matter specialists arose from on-site presentations by and questioning of industry experts and through evaluations of previous editions of the reports.  EIA has found that the petroleum refining sector has historically operated on extremely thin margins, as a rule, and that the market itself is international in nature. As a result, the opportunity for firms to provide detailed, accurate and comprehensive crude and product margin analysis and forecasts critical to that sector?s operations are limited.  EIA?s subject matter specialists have had years of experience in reviewing products of this kind and found that this is the best source of information of this nature.  Interested parties must submit a letter of interest and capability statement via email for consideration by July 9, 2010 to Brandon Powell at brandon.powell@hq.doe.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 541990. 
The written response must include a general technical proposal for performing the services mentioned in this announcement, past performance client information for similar work, resumes of individuals who would be potentially assigned to the work and a rationale why the your firm?s solution would be in the Government?s best interest.

<DESC>THIS IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION. The Food and Drug Administration, Jefferson Laboratories, in Jefferson, Arkansas, is seeking small business sources, including, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small business and 8(a) certified companies. The government would also like large businesses capable of meeting this requirement to respond as well. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort. The government is seeking sources capable of providing a computerized stereology investigation system plus apparatus for performing brain mapping, neuron tracing, anatomical mapping, and morphometry. The system to include stereo investigator microscope, computer and software/hardware.
<p>The government is requesting information from potential contractors that have a system similar to that of MBF Bioscience Neurolucide and Stereo Investigator microscope. The system should be capable of performing design-based stereology on isotropic or vertical (anisotropic) sections. The vendor must provide the installation, training and warranty.</p>
<p>The system will be used to support studies involving research into sexual hormone-like compounds extensively exist in nature foods and/or food-processing chains and render physiology-interfering or pathophysiological impacts on human central nervous system, noticeably the sexual dimorphic brain structures. The current method in evaluation of the compounds in neurotoxicity, determination of changes in size of the sexual dimorphic brain structures of the experimental animals, is single-disciplinary approaching (anatomic or developmental neurobiological) and thus less sensitive, indicating the unmet need for general public safety screening of sexual hormone-like compounds.<br />Our objective is to establish a multidisciplinary approach in assessing those compounds. We will investigate the brain structures by conventional histology, immunohistochemistry and projection-tracing marker(s), which simultaneously addresses morphological and biochemical bases and functional connection as well. Stereology is the state of the art technology that provides quantitative measurements necessary for the proposed tasks.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes.
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing iris imaging systems. NIST has special interest in iris cameras that captures both eyes at the same time; previously this has required two separate image acquisitions. The key feature which makes this possible is automatic face-finding, and using the face image to precisely locate eye position.</p>
<p>Biometric data play is an important role in identification, access control and security screening. While many biometrics have been proposed, only a handful have been demonstrated to be effective and workable. Iris imaging is among the more successful biometrics, and has steadily been gaining in prominence. Two features principally account for this: 1) iris imaging has been demonstrated to have high accuracy; and 2) it is minimally intrusive during data acquisition.</p>
<p>As part of its mission to assess the state of the art in biometric identification, NIST has a strong interest in new biometric products/improvements, and in the creation and adherence to Published Standards affecting these. Adherence to published standards is important, as this has a strong impact upon the usability and portability/interoperability of the data.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for iris imaging systems that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is interested in procuring two (2) Iris Sensors with the following minimum technical capabilities:</p>
<p>1) Must capture both irises simultaneously via face-finding<br />2) Must adhere to the ISO image standard</p>
<p>The reason for two (2) procurements is that: a) one of these must be a highly portable, hand-held system, while b) the second system must be a stationary (permanent emplacement) miniaturized system.</p>
<p>3) The portable hand-held system must have:<br />a. Nominal physical dimensions of 6" x 4", or smaller <br />b. Must collect a face image conforming to ISO/IEC 19794-5 geometric specifications <br />c. Must collect ISO/IEC 19794-6 standards compliant iris images of both eyes<br />d. Iris image capture distance should embrace the range 100 mm to 360 mm<br />e. Iris image resolution must correspond to at least 100 pixels between eyes, or better<br />f. Must have a USB interface to host computer<br />g. Iris capture in two (2) seconds or less; complete transaction time in ten (10) seconds or less<br />4) The second, non-hand-held, system must have similar performance, though by giving up the hand-held feature, higher performance is to be expected:<br />a. Physical dimensions: while not critical, a smaller and relatively unobtrusive unit is preferred<br />b. Must collect a face image conforming to ISO/IEC 19794-5 geometric specifications <br />c. Must collect ISO/IEC 19794-6 standards compliant iris images of both eyes<br />d. Unit must be capable of functioning with subjects moving<br />e. Must have an "enrollment on the fly" capability, and be able to process subjects in 4 seconds on a sustained basis<br />f. Unit must be capable of imaging subjects at distances up to approximately 500mm</p>
<p><br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334119, as those domestic sources having 1,000 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture iris sensors, meeting the above referenced specifications, are requested to e-mail product literature and a letter describing their abilities to andrea.parekh@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources-sought notice.</p>
<p>The letter should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.</p>
<p>Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: <br />1. Name and business size of the company that manufactures the iris camera for which specifications are provided; <br />2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the iris camera, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address); <br />3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such iris cameras; <br />4. Indication of whether each instrument (including installation) for which specifications are sent to andrea.parekh@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s);<br />5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>All documentation must be sent to Andrea Parekh, Contract Specialist, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. E-mail address: ANDREA.PAREKH@NIST.GOV.</p>
<p>Submission must be received not later than 3:00 PM local time on July 2, 2010.</p>

<DESC>Introductory Paragraph<br />This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement.
<p>Background<br />The National Toxicology Program (NTP), an interagency program headquartered at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), is a recognized leader in toxicology testing and research. The program provides a focal point within the federal government for the toxicological testing of chemical and physical substances to identify potential hazards for human health and for the development of improved testing methods. In 2004, the NTP released a roadmap for the 21st century providing a framework that would support an advancement in toxicology testing toward the development and use of new approaches, many focused on cellular and molecular strategies, which could potentially improve the predictability of toxicological data for assessing human health. Subsequently, in 2007, the National Research Council published its report, Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and A Strategy, which addresses the need for new testing approaches based on the identification of perturbations in key biological pathways.</p>
<p>In carrying out its roadmap, the NTP's assessment of current and new methods for its toxicity testing strategy focuses on key biological pathways relevant for understanding human susceptibility to toxicity and disease. Thus, having an established source of toxicogenomic data and associated tissues would potentially accelerate its roadmap activities and contribute significantly to the evolution of toxicology testing.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The purpose of this requirement is to obtain an established toxicogenomic database and tissue library.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />Critical Features of Toxicogenomics Database and Tissue Library:</p>
<p>1. Database must include:<br />a. a graphics user interface that allows for rapid scoring of genomic signatures of toxicity<br />b. a framework that allows the storage and analysis of multiple data types<br />c. In vivo study data must:<br />(i) be from male Sprague Dawley rats,<br />(ii) include multiple dose levels and exposure durations (1, 3, 5,7, 14, 30 and/or 90 days),<br />(iii) (with the exception of bioactive peptides) be performed via the oral route of administration (gavage dosing). In the case of peptides, it is acceptable that the test article be administered by injection.<br />(iv) be from a diversity of chemical treatments (a minimum of 600 distinct chemical entities) including, but not limited to US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs, standard biochemicals, and environmental toxicants<br />(v) Specific in vivo data metrics should include:<br />(a) histopathology (on all tissues which were evaluated by microarray),<br />(b) clinical chemistry,<br />(c) hematology,<br />(d) body and organ weights, and<br />(e) gene expression (microarray) profiles of liver (&gt;300 of the test articles), kidney (&gt;200 of the test articles), heart (&gt;200 of the test articles), thigh muscle (&gt;10 of the test articles), bone marrow (&gt;50 of the test articles), spleen (&gt;30 of the test articles), brain, and intestine.<br />d. In vitro data must include pharmacology assays for toxicologically relevant endpoints (listed below) for all chemicals (with the exception of in vitro rat hepatocyte genomic studies) studied in vivo (rat):<br />(i) receptor binding, and<br />(ii) absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion<br />(iii) it is estimated that &gt;100 assays would be required to adequately address all toxicologically relevant endpoints alluded to in (i) and (ii).<br />(iv) toxicogenomic (microarray) studies of cultured rat primary hepatocytes with &gt;100 distinct test articles (must overlap with test articles evaluated in vivo studies described above)<br />e. Drug literature profiles for all chemicals listed in the database. Specifically, the descriptions should include, but not be limited to, chemical pharamacology, toxicology, structure, and associated molecular pathways.</p>
<p>2. Rodent Tissue Library should include:<br />(i) snap frozen tissue and corresponding total RNA from liver, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, whole blood (or plasma) from rats treated with a minimum of 600 test articles including, but not limited to FDA approved drugs, standard biochemicals and environmental toxicants. <br />(ii) tissues/RNA must be from the same Sprague Dawley rats used to create the associated toxicogenomics database described above.</p>
<p>Anticipated Delivery Period</p>
<p>Delivery for the Toxiogenomics Database and Tissue Library is within 60 days from date of award.</p>
<p>Information Sought<br />Interested organizations are required to submit five (5) hard copies of their capability statement, not to exceed fifteen (15) pages in length; not including a standard product brochure that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above and should be tailored to the "Project Requirements" as concise as possible.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT TRAINING GROUP, INC. AS AN 8(A) DIRECT AWARD.<br /><br />The Science Master's Program (SMP) prepares graduate students for careers in business, industry, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies by providing them with a strong foundation in science, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and with research experiences, internship experiences, and skills to succeed in those careers. SMP is intended to catalyze the creation of institution-based efforts that can be sustained without additional federal funding. SMP also encourages diversity in student participation so as to contribute to a broadly inclusive, well-trained science and engineering workforce.
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF), requires a contractor to: 1) assist the program in developing the program theory of action; 2) conduct a descriptive review of the SMP portfolio based on secondary analyses of the proposals funded; 3) develop template for collecting quantitative data to respond to the program metrics; 4) a critique and synthesis of project assessment and evaluation plans; and 5) a develop a plan for tracking graduates.<br />This program is offered as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. All stipend recipients supported by SMP funds must be full-time students and citizens or permanent residents of the US, its territories or possessions. A SMP project has to address the following:<br /><br />&bull; A needs assessment that describes the nature of the workforce needs with data that substantiate the need at the local, national, or even global level.<br />&bull; A comprehensive description of how the workforce need will be met<br />&bull; Innovative graduate education and training mechanisms<br />&bull; A research experience appropriate to the SMP theme<br />&bull; Plan for recruitment, mentoring, retention and graduation of US graduate students including efforts aimed at members of groups underrepresented in STEM<br />&bull; Plan for disseminating knowledge about innovative graduate education</p>
<p>The actual cost of the work cannot be estimated within a range sufficiently exact to permit the establishment of a reliable firm fixed price. The contractor will be required to develop a program theory of action and revised plan of evaluation activities, conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses, develop a cross-project report templates for gather purposes, review and summarize evaluation plans and data collection. In order to develop a conceptual framework, the contractor will be required to meet with NSF staff as well as review relevant reports and research data. The variables cited above make it impracticable to establish a firm fixed price for the services needed.</p>

<DESC>Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Â§ 8127(c) and the provisions of Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Acquisition and Material Management (OA&MM) Public Law 109-461, The VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS) has a requirement for Powered Instrument Driver, Impaction Drill and Burs.
 Alliant is a Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) and the only authorized distributor of Stryker Medical. The requirement that is being procured for the VASDHS is a unique product distributed by Alliants.
It is recommended that a sole source Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) award be made to Alliant Healthcare Products. 
In accordance with FAR 6.302 "Circumstances Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition" the following statutory authority is cited as justification to award a sole source Veteran Owned Small Business contract valued more than $30,000 (simplified acquisition threshold) and less than $5,000,000 (authority ceiling limit)
FAR 6.302-5 "Authorized or Required by Statute"
(a)	Authority
(1) Citations: 10 U.S.C 2034(c) (5)
(2) Full and Open Competition need not be provided for when - 
	(i) A statute expressly authorizes
Statute: P.L 109-461 Sec. 502 as codified in 38 U.S.C. Â§ 8127(c)
Sole Source Contracts for Contracts Above Simplified Acquisition Threshold- For purposes of meeting the goals under subsection (a), and in accordance with this section, a contracting officer of the Department may award a contract to a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans using procedures other than competitive procedures if--
(1) such concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity;
(2) the anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403)) but will not exceed $5,000,000; and
(3) in the estimation of the contracting officer, the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.

The contracting officer has validated that the contractor is registered and certified in the VA VetBiz.gov data base and qualifies as "small" in accordance with federal small business size standards for the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to the procurement. This procurement falls under NAICS code 423450 Medical, Dental, and Hospital Equipment and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers, which has a size standard of 100 employees. According to VetBiz.gov, Alliant currently has 50 employees. 


The Contracting Officer has determined the contractor to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contracting opportunity by:  (check all that apply)
	(  ) Past Performance Survey
	(x) Validation of contractor GSA FSS or GWAC contract
	(x) Prior VA Contracts
	
	
The contract price of $47,687.50 including options is within the limits for the sole source award authority.

The Contracting Officer estimates that the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price and offers the best value to the United States based upon: (check all that apply)
(x) Marketing Survey - based on a GSA market survey among other VOSB companies, it is determined that Alliant is the main provider of the Powered Instrument Driver, Impaction Drill and Burs.
	(  ) Comparison of Commercial Prices 
	(x) Validation of contractor GSA FSS or GWAC contract - Alliant has a current GSA contract, however the Powered Instrument Driver, Impaction Drill and Burs are open market items.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notice Type:</span></strong> <br />Notice of Intent - Sole Source
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, intends to negotiate with Coventor, Inc.; Cary, NC, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to provide the services described below.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></strong></p>
<p>The Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology has been using CoventorWare Analyzer over the last year and has generated a significant amount of modeling data with it. Market research shows that no other software package is compatible with this data. Therefore, by not renewing the license and purchasing different software instead, NIST would not be able to access results obtained over the past year. All work done using this software would be lost. Additionally, NIST collaborates with a group at Argonne National Labs, which also uses this software. NIST would not be able to share models and results with them if it used a different package that is incompatible with CoventorWare.</p>
<p>NIST intends to procure annual maintenance for CoventorWare Analyzer, to include all upgrades, technical support, and electronic documentation. Recent market research conducted by NIST shows that Coventor, Inc. is the only authorized provider of this maintenance in the United States.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 511210. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Coventor, Inc. for this requirement. <br />Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST and are authorized by Coventor, Inc.to provide these services may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before July 2, 2010 at 12 pm EST. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  

This notice is issued in accordance with the guidance for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and FAR Subpart 5.705.  

Contract Number SB1341-07-CQ-0016, Task Order Number 69225 was awarded to Merrick and Company of Aurora, CO on July 10, 2009 in the amount of $455,379.00.  Modification T001 was executed on January 28, 2010.  Modification T002 was executed on March 29, 2010.

Work under Task Order Number 69225 will develop and deliver a detailed design for the upgrade of the plumbing system of the thermal shield at the NIST/Center for Neutron Research.  The upgrade requires that cooling water be administered by moving it through the shield using a vacuum rather than a positive pump pressure, as in the present mechanical configuration.

Modification T003 shall be executed to extend the period of performance, change the payment schedule, and increase the total value of the task order.   

The period of performance shall be changed as follows:
FROM: July 10, 2009 through May 24, 2010;
TO:  July 10, 2009 through June 30, 2010.

Due to redesign resulting from  a need to utilize an alternate valve seat material and a NIST requirement for the Contractor to not enter the holding tank when installing a sparge system and vortex breakers, the total amount of the Task Order will be increased by $37,974.00 from $503,177.00 to $541,151.00.  The payment schedule will be modified to incorporate the price increase.

In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(iii), this modification is being executed  against a task order awarded on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract and all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-06-C-0038, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Black Warrior and Tombigbee Waterway and Alabama River System, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to add the following work to: Grade and Pave the access road and parking in Demopolis Lower Pool Park.   This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated in the existing contract.  <BR> <BR>This existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor is already working in the area renovating the boat ramp and clearing debris.    2) The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during the work.  A detailed scope of work has not been prepared.   3)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the other ongoing work without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the area is closed thus minimizing the impact on the public.    <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />FOR<br />820th RED HORSE</p>

We often produce concrete and asphalt in-house but we need a readily available source to purchase prime coat.

<p>2.1. Prime Coat will be delivered and applied to various areas on Nellis AFB or Creech AFB on an as needed basis with 48 hours notice.</p>

<DESC>The 902nd Contracting Squadron, 395 B Street West, Suite 2, Randolph AFB, TX has a requirement to purchase items as described in the Description of Supplies. This is a streamlined combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
<p>This announcement constitutes the only notice. A written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is issued as a Request for Quote. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those that are in effect as of Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-42. A firm fixed price award will be made in accordance with the Description of Supplies.</p>
<p>This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside with the the NAICS Code of 335129; size standard 500.</p>
<p>IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(c) - Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. A Firm Fixed Priced Award will be made in accordance with the following Description of Supplies:</p>
<p><br />CONTRACT DESCRIPTION EST QTY UNIT TOTAL <br />LINE ITEM PRICE PRICE<br />(CLIN)</p>
<p>0001 Lycian M2 Long Throw Magnetic Ballast 2 EA $ $<br />and Leg Base <br /><br />0002 Lycian M2 Medium Throw Lens 2 EA $ $</p>
<p><br />0003 Lycian OSRAM HTI 1200 2/D7/60 2 EA $ $<br /><br /><br />0004 KEEL-AFE Blue Custom Road Case 2 EA $ $</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>HQ AFSVA has a requirement to purchase two (2) follow spotlight systems to be used as part of their stage lighting systems. The spotlights are positioned behind an audience and are projected onto a stage. Tops in Blue performs in medium to large venues and the spotlights required are designed to have different "throws" to accommodate different sizes of venues. Normally, this would require a pair of complete separate medium- or long-throw spotlights; Tops in Blue would be required to transport four spotlight systems to meet all venue requirements. The Lycian M2 follow spotlight system is the only spotlight that incorporates modules to change the throw of a single spotlight. That means one spotlight can do the job of multiple spotlights. Two (2) M2 spotlights with a long-throw module and a medium-throw module can meet all Tops in Blue mission requirements with almost half the amount of equipment. This helps minimize setup and teardown times and also makes the most efficient use of limited storage and cargo transportation space. The M2 also features a unique "flip-flop" lens that provides either a fixed or variable focus, providing maximum flexibility in a single unit. Additionally, the Lycian M2 follow spotlight system has the ability to do the work of multiple spotlights with a single unit. For the reasons stated above HQ AFSVA requires that the specific brand and model be purchased in support of Tops in Blue.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />WAWF INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: <br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number <br />-CAGE Code <br />-Issue Date <br />-Issue By DoDAAC <br />-Admin DoDAAC <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC <br />-Ship to Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code) <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*<br />-Pay DoDAAC</p>

a. 	To obtain proper identification, contractor employees requiring recurring access (more than 90 days), must complete an application identification form (SMCAR 3058) for access to the installation.  The form can be obtained from the Contracting Officer (CO) or Contracting Officer Representative (COR).  The form must be signed by the CO or COR and also identify the contract number and expiration date before the badge can be issued.  This form is brought to the Security Division, Badge and Identification Section, Building 1136 for processing of proper identification required per terms of the contract.  Contractors requiring access for less than 90 days will be required to obtain a pass (Visitor Registration Form) from the Visitor Control Center.  Passes will be issued for dates access is required, not to exceed 90 days.  The CO or COR must complete the Visitor Registration Form applications on the PICAWEB prior to the contractor employee arriving at Picatinny Arsenal.
b.	 For the performance of this contract, the contractor shall utilize only employees who are U.S. Citizens or lawfully admitted and employed non-citizens.
c. 	The contract will not take effect until the contractor certifies, in writing, that all personnel utilized in the performance of this contract have been, or will be verified to be lawfully employable in the United States, and that the contractor has or will complete a criminal background check before an individual is utilized in performance of this contract.
i.	Lawful employability will be verified by means of Employment Eligibility Form, INS Form I-9(if applicable), or by other applicable INS documentation approved for a specific non-citizen status. ii.	The criminal background check will establish that neither the Contractor, nor individual's state or nation of permanent residence has any record or credible information that the individual has a "criminal history". In this context, "criminal history" will be defined as adjudicated guilt   or pending adjudication of a crime as defined under New Jersey law or equivalent offense under the applicable laws of another jurisdiction.  If the contractor has doubt about the applicability of an offense to this definition, the circumstances must be reported to TACOM-ARDEC Security for adjudication of the individual's employability."
d. 	Any delay in the furnishing of the above, including any delay in the obtaining of the background check, is at the sole risk of the contractor and will not be the basis of any equitable adjustment or other change to the contract.
e. 	The contractor shall utilize only qualified, responsible, and capable employees in the performance of the work on the contract. The Contractor shall not employ persons for contract work to be conducted on the installation who have criminal history. The Contracting Officer will require that the contractor remove from performance of work, employees who have a criminal history, endanger persons or property, or whose continued employment under this contract is inconsistent with the interests of military security. Additionally, the TACOM-ARDEC Commander may bar such employees from the installation.
f. 	The identification badge or pass issued to each employee of the contractor is for his own use only.  Misuse of the badge or pass, such as permitting others to use it will result in criminal charges under Title 18 USC 499 and 701; and barring the employee from Picatinny Arsenal.  Should the employee lose the badge or pass, the contractor may be charged for the cost of re-issuance of the badge or pass.  Additionally, the employee and the contractor must submit a sworn affidavit as to the circumstances of the loss before a new badge or pass is issued.
g. 	Fingerprinting of employee and any other procedure deemed necessary for the security of Picatinny Arsenal may be required at the discretion of Picatinny Security. All Contractor personnel requiring access to the Picatinny ADP system are required to have a National Agency check.
h.	Permission to use photographic capable cell phones on Army installations must be requested through proper security channels.  No Portable Electronic Devices (PED) devices will be used in an area where classified information is discussed or electronically processed. 	Currently, all (to include personally owned) photographic capable devices will not be  brought onto the Picatinny Arsenal installation nor used by personnel on Army installations as a photographic device without proper authority granted by the Security Office.  If an individual is seen using one of these phones as a photographic device, the phone will be confiscated and turned in to the Security Office IAW AR 190-13, Para 6-6a(1).  All images on the phone will be removed, and the individual will be allowed to pickup his/her phone at the end of the day from the Security Office.  This policy applies to all military personnel, government civilians, contractors, and visitors.   2.	All contractor employees, while on the premises at Picatinny Arsenal, shall continually wear the badge, obtained pursuant to paragraph 1 above.  The badge shall be worn so as to be visible to others at all times.  Individuals issued passes will have on their person the pass.

If a visiting contractor is working on a classified contract his/her visit request with security clearance information must be approved by the TACOM-ARDEC Industrial Security Division, where it will be held on file. Government employees hosting meetings will verify the contractor employee's security clearance information is on file in the TACOM-ARDEC Security Division prior to contractor access to classified information. 
4. 	When the contract number under which the badge / pass was obtained is completed (date of last delivery or performance of last service, termination of the contract or release of the employee) including any exercise of an option pursuant to the terms of the contract, the contractor shall return the badges / passes for all of their employees to Picatinny Security and obtain a receipt for each within (3) three business days. Identification cards, Computer Access Cards and computer accounts must be surrendered to ARDEC - Security upon completion of the contract or an employee's termination during the life of the contract.
5. 	Failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph 4 will be grounds for withholding any funds due the contractor until completion of the requirement, notwithstanding any other clause or requirements in the contract.  Failure to comply may also be used as an adverse factor with respect to contractor past performance in connection with award of future contracts to the firm.
6. 	If the contractor obtains a new or follow-on contract for work at Picatinny Arsenal, he shall obtain new badges / passes for each of his employees indicating the new or follow-on contract number and comply with the applicable provisions of the follow-on contract which cover the subject matter of this Clause.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to&nbsp;LItmus Rapid-B9601 Katy Freeway, Suite 300, Houston, TX 77024, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 for the item(s) listed below.
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. This notice is issued for informational purposes only and not a request for competitive proposals. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>
<p>A sole source determination was based on the following: The A-40 flow cytometer, made by Litmus Rapid-B, is the current instrument being used in the laboratory. It has approved protocols/standard operating procedures (SOP) in place when used for FDA enforcement and outbreak response. This instrument requires validation in order to carry out that critical function. Part of the validation process requires the demonstration that the methods work for detecting and enumerating target bacteria in food on multiple instruments. This means that multiple instruments must get the same results from the same assays they perform. The assays that will be used are for: salmonella, listeria and E. coli 0157, all important to the health security of the American people. Litmus has developed the specific reagents for these particular assays. The reagents and the flow cytometer must work in tandem as a part of the validation process. Any other flow cytometer will not provide the required analysis capabilities or compatibility.&nbsp;Litmus Rapid-B is the only manufacturer of the A-40 flow cytometer instrument. No other instruments can be used because they would not give equivalent results nor maintain the consistency of results already in place.</p>
<p>The proposed award is for products under the associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is- 334516-Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>

Given that the current configuration of the existing switch is no longer capable of expansion and is near its maximum of 128 cameras, a new switch matrix is required. The new switch, located on the west wall per the drawing, will include a new CPU, cage and all the video cards necessary to produce a switch that will provide a total of 160 camera inputs with 16 monitor outputs. New switch must be compatible with existing coaxitron translators, cameras and new DVR's. Along with the new switch, 2 new keyboard controllers will be provided to replace the existing worn-out controllers.

Re-Cabling of CCTV Head End:
The primary goal of re-cabling the head end is to provide "strain relief" or relieve the pressure and strain the cables are currently placing on the system components. Over time this has had a dramatic effect on the performance of the system by directly creating termination issues in the form of shorts and disconnects, or poor connections. In addressing the goal it will give an opportunity to deploy cable management trays and reÂ¬cable the entire system at the head end. This will include organizing and re-routing of the cable in a manner which will allow for easier service of the system in the future.
The camera viewing monitors are currently a mix of 9" crts and other sizes of CRT and flat panel LCD's and are scattered across south and west walls along with a mix of various computer monitors. All camera monitors will be relocated to the west wall in accordance with the included configuration drawing. The existing KVM/Voice logger monitor and keyboard and the Notifier NRT monitor and keyboard and two phones will be relocated from the west wall to the south wall per the drawing. If the monitor output card from the existing switch is still serviceable and compatible with the new 160 input
switch matrix it will be reused in the system allowing expansion to 32 call monitors. In this configuration the operators will have the ability to display 28 cameras on 7 monitors, displayed as 4 pictures per screen with the addition of 5 new DMV94Q or equivalent multiplexers to the existing multiplexers. They will also be able to use the 8th monitor as their primary call monitor to view any camera as a larger single view directly in front of them.
The monitors displaying the DVR's will remain the same with the exception of being relocated to the west wall and existing CRT monitors changed to flat panel. Five new AGN-EP-19AV-LT or equivalent flat panel monitors with mounting kits will be provided to bring the total number of existing plus new monitors to thirteen.

Included in this portion of the scope is the re-cabling of the existing KVM to maintain the administration of the DVRs, switch, and other systems currently being administrated from this work station. Also included is the cabling required to relocate Access 1 CPU display, Access 2 CPU display, telephones, KVM / Logger CPU display, and the Fire CPU display to the south wall per the drawing.

Included with any new equipment is all required software and programming necessary to properly identify, display and record all existing cameras to the Police Chief's specifications. Two copies of all submittal documents and technical manuals will be provided.

Such work shall include food preparation, food serving, dishwashing, replenishing Government-provided supplies, and cleaning of dining hall and equipment.

Period of performance is for one base year plus two option years and commences 15 August 2010.  <BR><BR>TECHNICAL FACTORS:  <BR><BR>Refer to the requirements in the Statement of Work.<BR><BR>Offerors are strongly cautioned to complete Exhibit A, Parts 1 and 2, in its entirety, in the format provided.  Failure to do so may eliminate your proposal from consideration for award. <BR><BR>Offerors shall answer each question on the Exhibit A, Performance Relevancy Questionnaire in detail.  Use as much space as necessary.  Offeror shall complete three (3) to five (5) Part 1 of Exhibit A and only one (1) Part 2 of Exhibit A.

Include awards, customer letters of commendation, etc., with points of contact and telephone numbers.  <BR><BR>PAST PERFORMANCE:  <BR><BR>Past Performance References  REQUIRED  Offerors shall prepare and submit to prior client(s) of the all the projects listed on your Exhibit A submission a Reference Package (Exhibit B) (Detailed instructions are included in Exhibit B Package).  This includes correspondence explaining the requirement to obtain an independent evaluation of prior contract performance, and the Past Performance Questionnaire for use in evaluating Past Performance. <BR><BR>EVALUATION FACTORS: <BR><BR>The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to the offeror whose proposal represents the BEST VALUE in response to this combined synopsis/solicitation in accordance with the following evaluation factors for this requirement: Past Performance, Price, and Technical. <BR><BR>1.1 EVALUATION METHODOLOGY. The evaluation of qualifying proposals will consist of three parts, <BR><BR>       1.1.1 	The Source Selection Evaluation (SSEB) will evaluate an offeror's Past Performance at a factor level that most accurately defines the offeror's performance risk considering all potential evaluation criteria identified in this section. <BR>       <BR>       1.1.2 The SSEB will evaluate an offeror's technical proposal using a color rating that combines technical merit and proposal risk that most accurately defines the offeror's performance risk. <BR>       <BR>       1.1.3 	The SSEB will evaluate price and assign a go or no/go rating to each proposal. <BR><BR>1.2 	The following process will be used to determine the best value for selection of the Dining Hall Food Preparation and Attendant Services award.<BR><BR>       1.2.1 To arrive at a Best Value decision, the Source Selection Authority (SSA) will integrate the evaluation Price with Past Performance and Technical.  Technical and past performance; when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. The firm that represents the best value to the Government will be selected for award.  <BR><BR>1.2.1.1 Note:  This acquisition is subject to the requirements of the Randolph-Sheppard Act. If the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind submits a proposal that meets the requirements of this solicitation (if award is made without discussions), or is in the competitive range (if discussions are held), award shall be made to Massachusetts Commission for the Blind.<BR><BR>       1.2.2 The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award the contract without discussions, therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. <BR>       <BR>       1.2.3 If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.<BR><BR>       1.2.4 The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; award a contract to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated; and award contracts to offerors submitting a proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.<BR>       <BR>       1.2.5 The Contracting Specialist will conduct a proposal compliance review before the convening of the Source Selection Board and refer any non-compliant proposals to the Contracting Officer and/or SSA for determination of adequacy.  Failure to comply with solicitation instructions (outlined in the solicitation) will result in the proposal being found non-responsive, rejected and eliminated from further consideration for award.<BR><BR>       1.2.6 A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>2.1 PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION <BR><BR>	2.1.1  The SSEB will conduct a performance risk assessment based upon the past performance of the offeror as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the work required by the solicitation.  The evaluation will consider the offeror's past performance considering currency, relevancy, sources, context, and trends to include but not limited to:<BR><BR>  2.1.1.1 Personnel<BR>  2.1.1.2 Ordering, Receipt and Care of Food and Related Products<BR>  2.1.1.3 Meal Preparation and Serving<BR>  2.1.1.4 Sanitation Requirements<BR>  2.1.1.5 Care of Government/Customer Furnished Property and Facilities<BR>  2.1.1.6 Safety/Quality Control<BR>  2.1.1.7 Overall Customer Satisfaction<BR><BR>			2.1.2  In conducting the performance risk assessment, the SSEB may use data provided by the offeror, and data obtained from other sources.   Contractors have been asked to submit 3-5 completed Exhibit A Part 1, one (1) Exhibit A Part 2, and  prepare and submit to prior client(s) of the all the projects listed in Exhibit A submission a Reference Package (Exhibit B)  in order to provide the Government with adequate past performance information. The evaluator may: evaluate past performance information through the use of questionnaires completed by the offeror's references (Exhibit B); use data independently obtained from other Government or commercial sources, to include but not limited to Government databases; or reliance upon personal business experience with the offeror.  The evaluation will also consider information provided relative to corrective actions taken to resolve problems on past or existing contracts.   The evaluators may contact references and parties other than those identified by the offeror, and information received may be used in the evaluation of the offerors past performance.  While the government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the offeror.<BR><BR>		 2.1.3  An offeror with no past performance shall be evaluated as NEUTRAL.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most <BR>advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offerors. Offerors without previous Government contracts shall also be rated neutral.<BR><BR>		2.1.4  Currency and Trends: The SSEB will consider the currency and trends of the performance information while conducting its performance evaluation.  For the purpose of this solicitation, currency is performance occurring within the last three (3) years prior to the solicitation release date.  Within this period, performance occurring later in the period may have greater significance than work occurring earlier in the period.  For example, performance information for work occurring between 1 August 2009 and the date of the proposal may have greater importance than performance information for work occurring from 1 August 2007 through 1 August 2009. <BR><BR>	2.1.5  Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposals, e.g., the relevance of an offeror's past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond or to resolve minor clerical errors.<BR><BR>	2.1.6  In the evaluation of Past Performance, the evaluator will use the following adjectives and related definitions to define the performance risk the contractor poses. <BR><BR>Risk rating/Description of risk rating<BR><BR>Very Low Risk<BR>Very high quality past performance.  Problems, if any, were negligible and were resolved in a timely and highly effective manner.  Performance was generally current and very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Governments requirements.  <BR><BR>Low Risk<BR>Good quality past performance.  Minor problems may have been identified however; contractor took satisfactory corrective actions to resolve where appropriate.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR><BR>Average Risk<BR>Adequate quality of past performance.  Problems may have been identified and the contractor usually took adequate corrective action.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Although performance exceeds expectations and was rated excellent to very good the projects submitted were generally semi-relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation.  Fair probability of success with an average degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR><BR>Above Average Risk<BR>Rather poor quality of past performance. Problems may have been identified and contractor occasionally took corrective action, but not always to the owners satisfaction.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Fair probability of success with an overall above average risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR><BR>High Risk<BR>Unacceptable quality of past performance. There were problems, some of a somewhat serious to serious nature.  Contractors corrective action was sometimes marginally effective to ineffective.  Performance was current and very relevant to semi-relevant.  Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR><BR>Neutral<BR>No current and/or relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Government personnel were unable to identify any relevant Past Performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors.  This is neither a negative nor a positive assessment.  <BR><BR>2.2 TECHNICAL PROPOSAL EVALUATION  <BR><BR>TECHNICAL FACTORS - The evaluation of each technical proposal will access and measure the ability of the offeror to provide the specified service/supply outlined in the Request for Proposal (RFP).   To be considered technically acceptable the offeror will have to:<BR><BR>(1) Demonstrate capability of providing services that meet or exceed the requirements listed in the Statement of Work.<BR>(2) The contractor must provide an affirmative statement regarding ability to commence, and continue, food services during the Period of Performance listed in this solicitation.<BR>(3) Experience in full service Dining Facility operations and demonstrate a clear understanding of the Camp Edwards dining services mission  and technical requirements of Dining Facility food service operations <BR>(4) Provide Past Performance in similar acquisitions<BR><BR>Adjectival rating/Description of adjectival rating<BR><BR>Very Good<BR>Proposal meets solicitation requirements, demonstrates a very good understanding of the requirements and has salient features that offer significant advantage to the Government.  Very good in all respects.  Advantages/strengths not offset by disadvantages/weaknesses.  Very good probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Government requirements.  <BR><BR>Good<BR>Proposal meets most solicitation requirements and demonstrates a good understanding of the requirements but does not offer significant advantages to the Government over basic RFP requirements.  Disadvantages/weaknesses are not significant, unless significant advantages are proposed that outweigh significant disadvantages.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications, given by contractor, were acceptable.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government requirements.   <BR><BR>Satisfactory<BR>Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements, but offers disadvantages (weaknesses) outweighing other advantages (strengths).  Examples may include little or no experience cited; weak proposal; mimics RFP language rather than expressing offerors approach or understanding of the RFP.  Probability of success considered less than full confidence.<BR><BR>Marginal<BR>Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements.  Examples:  Proposal does not address all required RFP criteria; little or no experience to the extent that Overall quality cannot be determined because of errors, omissions or deficiencies that may be capable of being corrected without a major rewrite or revision of proposal.  Probability of success is questionable without further explanation by offeror.  <BR><BR>Unsatisfactory<BR>Proposal demonstrates little to no understanding of the requirements; or approach fails to adequately meet acceptable performance expectations.  Proposal contains major errors; omissions or deficiencies.<BR><BR>2.3 	PRICE EVALUATION - The Source Selection Board will conduct comparative evaluations of offers concerning price.  The determination that a proposed price is reasonable should be based on the Independent Government Estimate (IGE). Pricing should be submitted as a separate attachment, to allow for non-disclosure of price until after technical and past performance have been rated.  If the price is determined to be reasonable in comparison to the (IGE) a GO rating will be given, if found to be unreasonable, a NO GO rating will be assigned to the price evaluation factor. <BR><BR>2.3.1  Discounts:  Prompt payment discounts will not be considered in the <BR>evaluation of offers. <BR>	<BR>       2.3.2  Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<BR><BR><BR>INSTRUCTIONS:<BR><BR>Offers shall include in their proposal:<BR><BR> (1) A detailed proposal that shows pricing for Dining Facilities services as follows:<BR><BR>BASE YEAR  Period of Performance 15 August 2010  14 August 2011:<BR><BR>CLIN 0001	QTY: 1  Lump Sum 	Provide labor and expertise necessary to perform one hundred and twelve (112) days of Dining Facility Meal services.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-39.</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is a total small business set-aside. The associated NAICS code is 326199 for this solicitation. The small business size standard is 100 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for procurement of the following items:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Fiberglass Enclosure for Sensitive Oceanographic and Meteorological Instruments</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>Technical Specifications for 4' x 6' Equipment Enclosure<br />The following enclosure will be used to house sensitive electronic oceanographic and<br />meteorological instrumentation in remote coastal locations ranging from the equatorial<br />Pacific to the Arctic. The enclosure must be made of low maintenance materials and be<br />capable of withstanding extreme marine conditions including, but not limited to, extreme<br />temperatures, continuous salt spray, driving rain, regular sustained winds of at least 80<br />miles per hour, and occasional sustained winds of at least 160 miles per hour.</p>
<p>The enclosure must meet the following specifications:<br />External dimensions of 72" wide x 48" deep x a maximum external height of 92"; walls<br />should be at least 2" but no more than 3" thick and insulated. The roof shall have<br />sufficient pitch to facilitate runoff of rainwater under normal conditions and shall have<br />eaves extending at least 3" beyond the outer extent of the walls (i.e., the footprint of the<br />eaves shall be at least 78" wide and 54" deep). The portion of the ceiling contained within<br />the walls shall be of equivalent thickness to the walls and be insulated in a similar manner<br />to the walls; the eaves must be no more than 3/8" thick and shall not be insulated. The<br />minimum internal height of the enclosure shall be at least 74" from floor to ceiling. The<br />entire enclosure must weigh no more than 1500 pounds.</p>
<p>The enclosure shall be mounted on three integrated 44" to 48" runners at least 6" tall and at least 4", but no more than 6", wide with non-compressible cores. The runners shall<br />facilitate anchoring the enclosure to a solid surface such as a pier or parking lot. The<br />runners shall be integrated into the floor which in turn must be integrated into the upper<br />portion of the enclosure to prevent leakage or separation of the floor from the enclosure during lifting and/or extreme weather events. The enclosure must be designed to be both lifted from below by forklift and from above by crane. The roof shall be reinforced and include two lifting eyes to allow lifting by crane.</p>
<p>The floor shall have a passive one-way drain that will allow standing water to drain out but will not allow water in from below in the case of minor exterior flooding. The floor shallbe non-skid and capable of supporting the weight of at least three 250lb personnel carrying 50lbs of tools each.</p>
<p>The enclosure will be exposed to extreme temperatures and conditions as it may be used in<br />coastal locations ranging from the equatorial tropics to the arctic. The enclosure shall be<br />fabricated from material that is conducive to a marine environment and has a white, low<br />maintenance finish. The enclosure must have ventilation adequate to minimize<br />condensation while remaining waterproof in all but extreme conditions. Normal<br />conditions in many locations may include continuous winds of 60-70 miles per hour with<br />salt spray and/or driving rain and temperatures ranging from as low as -50&ordm; to as high as<br />+130&ordm; Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>The enclosure shall have a door centered in one of the long walls and shall be lockable and<br />remain waterproof in all but extreme conditions. The door shall be of an equivalent<br />thickness to the walls and shall be insulated. All externally exposed hardware shall be<br />stainless steel.</p>
<p>The enclosure shall have integrated electrical circuitry including a 120V, 15A alternating<br />current circuit breaker, lighting, and electrical outlets. The circuit breaker shall be<br />composed of standard off the shelf parts, preferably Square D, Type TIPO HOM<br />components. The light shall be switched and of a low profile style with explosion proof<br />housing. There shall be at least one 4-port 120V, 15A electrical outlet on each of the side<br />walls and the back wall (i.e., a minimum of three 4-port outlets). All exposed interior<br />electrical wiring shall be housed in rubber coated flex conduit.</p>
<p>Galvanized or stainless steel shallow depth Unistrut shall be installed on each of the side<br />walls and on the back wall running vertically from floor to ceiling every 14" (i.e., 2 runs of Unistrut on each side wall and 4 runs on the back wall). Unistrut shall be anchored via<br />hollow wall anchors, or similar method, in such a way that each run shall be capable of<br />supporting a minimum of 120lbs indefinitely without pulling away from the wall. A<br />vertically adjustable 18" deep shelf the width of the back wall, along with mounting<br />hardware, shall be provided.</p>
<p>(VII) Required delivery by August 30, 2010. Place of delivery is 7600 Sand Point<br />Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115. Quote shall include shipping charges.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis: <br />The Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting quotes, on behalf of the Protected Resources Division of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for a priority research project relative to the development of desktop survival estimates for Atlantic salmon smolts and kelts in the Penobscot River, Maine at 15 dams.<br />NMFS seeks to contract the development of desktop survival estimates for Atlantic salmon smolts and kelts in the Penobscot River, Maine at 15 dams (Table 1). The objective of this contract is the development of numerical survival distribution for Atlantic salmon smolts and kelts in the Penobscot River. The reports produced under this contract will use available, site-specific turbine system data, fish characteristics, and hydrological records to construct expected numerical distributions of Atlantic salmon survival at existing hydroelectric dams on the Penobscot River. These desktop survival analyses will include both direct mortality attributable to dam passage as well as delayed mortality based on available literature.<br />Site-specific survival studies are available for some hydroelectric facilities in the Penobscot Basin. These studies have been summarized by Fay et al. (2006) and Holbrook (2007). However, the limitations of currently available data are significant and NMFS is seeking to inform its modeling efforts with the best available data through the implementation of this contract. The implementation of this contract will include a comparison of any site-specific survival studies to the expected survival distributions. In instances where the expected distribution is different than the site-specific data, the vendor will be required to provide a justification for the differences (flow, water temperature, fish behavior, dam operations, etc).<br />This project only includes the compilation of existing data and information needed to develop numerical distributions of salmon smolt and kelt survival at existing hydroelectric facilities (Table 1) based upon: (1) Site-specific operations (number and type of turbines, head, wicket gate settings, etc.); (2) Station capacity and flow duration data; (3) Existing downstream fishway type and existing effectiveness data for those fishways; (4) Atlantic salmon life history factors (size, migration timing, etc.) The project does not require the collection of novel data. The majority of the contractor's time is expected to be spent reviewing existing literature and developing defensible survival distributions based on the available literature, synthesis of available data, and available characteristics of the environment (hydrography, temperature regimes, etc.), the fish (size, life history, etc.), and the physical characteristics of the various hydroelectric facilities (dam height, turbine types, wicket gate settings, downstream passage facilities, etc). Collection and synthesis of this information will require close coordination with numerous hydroelectric dam owners and natural resource agencies. Hydroelectric facilities to be included in the salmon survival curve analyses. (Dam Name, River, FERC ID)1. (Great Works, Penobscot River,2312) 2.(Vizier, Penobscot River,2403)3.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 541712. The small business size standard is 500 employees. NOAA anticipates 1 contract award as a result of this solicitation. The solicitation and proposed fixed price contract will be issued utilizing the test procedures identified in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items and will be evaluated on a best value basis wherein the following non-price factors (Factors 1 and 2), listed in descending order of importance, when combined, are significantly more important than price (Factor 3): Factor 1 - Experience, Factor 2 - Past Performance, Factor - Price. <br />All responsible sources may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency. To be eligible for award, vendors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR): www.ccr.gov and obtain a DUNS number by calling 1-800-333-0505. Prospective contractors are also required to complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with the required CCR registration. A copy of the solicitation is attached to this announcement as a downloadable Word file. Quotes will be due on July 12, 2010 by 4:00 P.M. A hard copy of the solicitation will be provided in response to a written or faxed request received directly from the requestor. Telephone requests for hard copies will not be honored. Requests for hard copies of the solicitation may be faxed to (757) 664-3640.

Volume I  Technical Capability

Volume III - Price

The quoter shall provide an original and three (3) copies of their entire submission.

Volume I  Technical Capability

The technical quotation should be directly responsive to the requirements contained in the PWS.  The quoter should set forth in detail, the overall technical approach, contractors physical capacity, and management approach for accomplishing the required work.  Each quotation will be evaluated in the light of the material and substantiating evidence presented in the quotation and not on the basis of what is inferred.  The quotation should not repeat the PWS.  Volume I shall not exceed forty (40) pages, exclusive of any resumes.

Volume II  Past Performance

The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance for similar work awarded within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of government agency or other non-government client; 2.

Pricing for CLINS 0001through 0031, and the combined total price for CLINS 0001 through 0031 in Volume III.

The quoter shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items in Volume III.

Basis for Award

The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoters quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to make an award to the quoter with the highest technically rated quotation rather than making an award at the the lowest evaluated price.  However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoters technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as equal, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.

Factor 1-Technical Capability: Technical capability subfactors: Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to address the following: 1. Technical Approach: (a) The quoter must demonstrate an understanding of the publications distribution process. (b) The quoter must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirements by describing the approach, methodology, technique, or plan that the quoter is proposing to accomplish the tasks defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  As evidenced by prior experience and a thorough narrative, the quoter must demonstrate an ability to operate a full-service publications distribution facility. 2. Contractors Physical Capacity: The quoter must specify the amount and location of physical space which will be allocated for the work required.  The quoter must demonstrate both the availability of adequate physical space and the access to requisite equipment to meet the EEOCs storage and distribution demands.  The Government reserves the right to conduct a site visit of the quoters proposed facility where the required work will be performed.  The quoters facility and equipment will be evaluated to determine their ability to perform the required services.  3. Management Approach: (a) The quoter must assign a Project Manager who will be the company's point of contact with EEOC. The Project Manager must be: (1) able to coordinate all phases of the project within the company, (2) have management experience in similar projects, and (3) have experience in large scale publications distribution processing. The quoter must designate an Alternate Project Manager to serve in the absence of the Project Manager. (b) The quoter must demonstrate its ability to effectively manage the personnel required to meet the requirements of the PWS. The quoter must demonstrate ability to respond quickly and effectively to the support services requirements, provide experienced and highly qualified key personnel, hire and retain highly qualified personnel, and manage the services required under the PWS. (c) The quoter shall describe its plan for managing the services required under the PWS. This plan shall include the proposed management structure, and describe how that structure will work to ensure successful task performance and compliance with all requirements of this PWS, including meetings. The quoter must provide narrative statements to demonstrate its ability to provide detailed financial and budgetary contract management, staffing, and comprehensive reporting of service level and inventory metrics. (d) The quoter shall provide resumes (will not be included in the page count but are limited to 2 pages each) for key personnel proposed for services. Individuals designated as key personnel will be committed to the project for its duration and cannot be replaced without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.

Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance for similar work awarded within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of government agency or other non-government client; 2. Name, title, e-mail, and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title, e-mail, and telephone number of client's program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided. EEOC will evaluate past performance based on timeliness, customer service, and corrective actions taken (if necessary) on similar requirements.

Factor 3  Price: The government will evaluate price quotations submitted in comparison to the independent government cost estimate. 

Evaluation of Options

Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Governments best interests, the Government will evaluate quotations for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government also reserves the right to conduct a site visit prior to award.  The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The provisions at 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The vendor shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with your quote.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695. <br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 08 JULY 2010, 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 08 JULY 2010.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Contracting Officer will make the determination whether to repair the item or will provide disposal instructions.</p>
<p>3.2 Detailed requirements.</p>
<p>3.2.1 Materials. The Contractor shall provide all spare parts, current technical manuals, discrete components and consumable materials needed for the repair of the items.</p>
<p>3.2.1.1 Selection of Parts and materials. The Contractor shall utilize parts and materials specified in the latest design specifications. Original equipment manufacturers (OEM) parts or parts that equal or exceed the performance and tolerance characteristics of the OEM parts must be used on all component part replacements. Any part which would change the form, fit, and/or function of the equipment or module shall not be used. Requests to utilize nonstandard (non-OEM or direct equivalent) parts shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for approval.</p>
<p>3.2.2 Repair process.</p>
<p>3.2.2.1 Inspection. In the course of repair, three levels of inspection shall be performed, as follows:</p>
<p>a. Incoming inspection. This inspection shall be performed at the point of receipt of the repair material to detect damage in transit. The items shall be inspected for completeness, for model type per contract or work order, and for obvious flaws and defects. If the equipment or module is received incomplete or damaged in transit, the Contracting Officer shall be immediately notified of the discrepancy. The Contractor shall identify and record the damaged property by its nomenclature; NSN, manufacturer's part number, date of receipt, quantity, number inspected, number defective or damaged, contract number, nature of the defect, circumstances of discovery, and estimated repair cost.</p>
<p>b. In-process inspections. These inspections shall be performed during repair in order to ensure completeness of repair and conformance to equipment technical requirements. Examples of such inspections are 1) adherence to fault isolation and test procedures, 2) proper application of coatings and treatments, and 3) proper mounting and connection of piece parts. The results of all in process inspections shall be recorded and submitted to the Contract Officer, see attachments for examples of the required information.</p>
<p>c. Final inspection. This inspection shall consist of 1) a visual inspection of workmanship, assembly and fit, mechanical and electrical safety and marking, materials, parts, and finish, and, treatment for prevention of corrosion and 2) verification of all operations specified in the equipment technical requirements. All final inspection observations and measurements shall be recorded and certified.</p>
<p>3.2.2.2 Disassembly. The degree of disassembly on any equipment or module processed by the Contractor shall be commensurate with the level of repair required.</p>
<p>3.2.2.3 Cleaning. Items requiring cleaning during repair shall be cleaned prior to or during the pre-induction inspection and disassembly, whichever is deemed more practical by the Contractor. Final cleaning shall be conducted to ensure the component is free of obvious defects and corrosion, soil, grease, residue, fingerprints, perspiration, or other acid or alkali residues. All temporary markings and tags, to include the CG-5236 Serviceable/Unserviceable Tag shall be removed.</p>
<p>3.2.2.4 Testing. In the course of repair, the Contractor will perform two types of testing:</p>
<p>a. Operational tests. These tests shall be for the purpose of verifying operation and to identify areas requiring fault isolation.</p>
<p>b. Final performance and acceptance testing. A dynamic test will be conducted to confirm acceptability of alignment and function. This must be accomplished using a fully operational equipment mock-up, or the use of Automated Test Equipment (ATE) with the ability to emulate live circuit conditions. The qualifying performance standard for the equipment shall be the test criteria contained in the equipment technical requirements.</p>
<p>3.2.2.5 Fault isolation. Troubleshooting of electronic equipment and modules shall recognize the fault symptom, identify the circuit responsible, and isolate the defective component(s) or sub assembly. After a fault has been localized, but prior to corrective action, ascertain that the specific fault is actually the cause of the malfunction rather than a symptom of some other malfunction. The Contractor shall be responsive to the troubleshooting procedures as indicated in the applicable technical documentation or established test procedures.</p>
<p>3.2.2.6 Parts replacement. Selection of parts for replacement shall be as specified in 3.2.1.1. The criteria for parts replacement shall be in accordance with 3.1.2.b.</p>
<p>3.2.2.7 Marking - Contractor identification. The Contractor shall affix a permanent vendor identification decal that is traceable by the Coast Guard to the Contractor, date of repair and the contract under which the repair was accomplished.</p>
<p>3.2.3 Technical specifications. Except where otherwise indicated, the Coast Guard will not provide the current technical specifications, manuals, or other technical data or diagnostics for repair of the items covered by this specification. The Contractor is responsible for obtaining the required technical manuals or data. This information shall remain the property of the Contractor but must be available for inspection by the Coast Guard.</p>
<p>3.2.3.1 Repair diagnostics. The Contractor shall develop repair diagnostics and test procedures to effectively troubleshoot problems with the components and repair the components to meet the requirements of this specification. The diagnostics and test procedures shall be in accordance with current technical specifications (see paragraph 3.2.3).</p>
<p>3.2.4 Test and diagnostic equipment. The Contractor shall provide all test and diagnostic equipment required to repair and test the items during the repair process.</p>
<p>3.2.5 Documentation. All rework performed and parts replaced on each item shall be documented. The record sheet shall contain all operations, including; inspection, initial testing, probable cause of failure, repair, alignment, cleaning, final testing, and inspection that have been performed.</p>
<p>3.2.5.1 Test data record sheet. A record of the data obtained during tests performed (see 3.2.4) shall be made on a test data record sheet. The Contractor is responsible for preparing and maintaining the documents. A copy of the applicable test data record shall be included with each item.</p>
<p>4. VERIFICATION</p>
<p>4.1 General. The Contractor shall maintain an inspection system in accordance with ANSI/ASQC-C1, which shall insure each item that is offered to the procuring activity for acceptance or approval conforms to contract requirements. The inspection system shall be documented and available for review and approval by the procuring activity.</p>
<p>4.2 Responsibility for inspection.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911. <br /><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

i.	Lawful employability will be verified by means of Employment Eligibility Form, INS Form I-9(if applicable), or by other applicable INS documentation approved for a specific non-citizen status.
 ii.	The criminal background check will establish that neither the Contractor, nor individual's state or nation of permanent residence has any record or credible information that the individual has a "criminal history". In this context, "criminal history" will be defined as adjudicated guilt   or pending adjudication of a crime as defined under New Jersey law or equivalent offense under the applicable laws of another jurisdiction.  If the contractor has doubt about the applicability of an offense to this definition, the circumstances must be reported to TACOM-ARDEC Security for adjudication of the individual's employability."

d. 	Any delay in the furnishing of the above, including any delay in the obtaining of the background check, is at the sole risk of the contractor and will not be the basis of any equitable adjustment or other change to the contract.

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>PLEASE NOTE: Sites must be reviewed prior to closing; however, the sponsors can be reviewed through the end of September.</p>
<p>We are interested in which sponsors and sites a vendor can review and a total cost for the review (all inclusive). An hourly rate is not a good indicator because the number of hours per visit is undetermined. In the evaluation process, we will look at which sponsor/sites can be reviewed and the total cost proposed to review the sponsor/sites.</p>
<p>Many summer programs begin when school ends which is usually in June but the majority run through the month of August. Some sites begin operations in July and may only be open for a few weeks but vendors will be able to choice among sites to visit since each site has different operating days.</p>
<p>We will send a list of operational dates for each site once the award is made.</p>

WORK TO BE PERFORMED:
Statement of WorkMaintenance of Telephone and Associated SystemsNational Park Service - Ellis Island and Liberty Island
1.	INTRODUCTIONThe specifications in this Statement of Work (SOW) cover the maintenance services that must be provided for the National Park Service's telephone and associated systems on Ellis Island and Liberty Island. Each island has its own NEC NEAX2000 IVS PBX, and the two are networked together by CCIS via a T1 link. The telephone systems were originally installed in the summer of 1999. There are no direct outside trunks on the Liberty Island switch; instead the trunks on the Ellis Island switch carry all outside calls. Centralized voice mail and call accounting systems serving both telephone systems also reside on Ellis Island. The voicemail system was upgraded to a NEAX AD-64 in late 2005, and the call accounting system is TAPIT for Windows. All inbound calls to both islands are answered by the Autoattendant on the AD-64. Component details of each system are given elsewhere in this SOW. Since personnel are on Ellis and Liberty Islands twenty-four hours per day, it is imperative that the telephone and associated systems be kept in good working order, and that malfunctions be dealt with promptly. 2.	SCOPEThe components of the systems listed in this SOW, plus their software and interconnections must be covered by the maintenance services.  This SOW and the contract line items provide for two types of service.  One type of service required is remedial maintenance, which is broken down into two categories of major and minor malfunction.  The primary difference between these two categories is response time.  Major malfunctions require a response time of two to four hours 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Minor malfunctions require a 24 hour response time Monday through Friday during normal business hours which for the purpose of this SOW is determined to be between the hours of 8:00 AM and 5:00.  The second type of service is to cover routine actions such as equipment moves, additions or changes.  To support these two types of services the contractor will provide pricing under an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract.  Remedial maintenance will be provided under a per call pricing with separate pricing for major malfunction calls broken out by; normal duty hours, outside normal duty hours Monday - Friday; and weekends and holidays.  Minor malfunction will have just one pricing structure since it is planned that these will only be required during duty hours.  The government will place an order for three major malfunction calls at the time of award; which will provide the contractor a guaranteed minimum for the contract. 
2.1.	Remedial MaintenanceThe vendor must provide remedial maintenance services, which are defined as maintenance services performed on an unscheduled basis when there is an equipment or software malfunction. Repair or replacement of a malfunctioning component is the responsibility of the vendor.2.1.1.	Service AvailabilityThe vendor's service organization must be reachable and available 24 hours per day, every day of the year, to deal with system malfunctions. The vendor must provide a specific contact telephone number for customer reporting of system problems.2.1.2.	Major MalfunctionA major malfunction is defined as a malfunction that materially affects a system's call processing capability, and includes, but is not limited to:"	the failure of any system feature required for call processing"	a malfunction affecting 10% or more of the stations on Ellis Island or 15% or more of the stations on Liberty Island."	a malfunction affecting 15% or more of the lines in any of the trunk groups on either switch, except that a failure affecting a lesser percentage of lines that materially affects call processing (e.g. the lead number in a hunt group) is also a major malfunction2.1.3.	Minor MalfunctionA minor malfunction is any malfunction not defined as a major malfunction.2.1.4.	Response Times2.1.4.1.	To Major MalfunctionThe vendor must make a best effort to respond within two hours, and in no case greater than four hours to a trouble call placed concerning a major malfunction. It is recognized that there may be some delay in getting onto Ellis Island or Liberty Island. Therefore, depending upon the circumstances and arrangements made, the four hour maximum will be from the time the trouble call was placed to the time the vendor's technician(s) arrive at:"	the guard house (Post 4) to the entrance of the bridge connecting Ellis Island to Liberty State Park, or"	the commercial ferry service at Battery Park, or"	the guard house (MIO) near Battery Park where the National Park Service boats depart2.1.4.2.	To Minor MalfunctionMaximum vendor response time after a trouble call has been placed concerning a minor malfunction must be less than 24 business hours.2.2.	Moves, Additions, and ChangesAt the request of the National Park Service, the vendor must provide labor and materials to effect moves, additions, and changes to the systems. The vendor must provide a rate schedule of labor charges and the days and times at which they apply. This rate schedule must include the charges for on-site labor during and outside normal business hours, as well as for weekends and holidays. In addition, the rate schedule must include the charges for work done through remote access and the days and times at which they apply.2.3.	Technical SupportThe National Park Service currently performs some tasks on the systems relating to administration, moves, additions, and changes. From time to time questions arise while performing these activities. The vendor is expected to cooperate in responding in a timely manner to occasional reasonable requests for information without charge. 
2.4.	Remote AccessThe vendor must have the capability for remotely accessing the PBX's and the voice mail system for diagnostic, maintenance, and administrative purposes. Remote access must be part of the vendor's normal operating procedures with its customers. The Ellis Island and Liberty Island systems are currently configured to allow for remote access.
3.	OTHER REQUIREMENTS3.1.	Authorized DealerThe vendor must maintain status as an authorized NEC dealer and the vendor's technicians must be certified to work on all of the Ellis Island and Liberty Island system components, including the voicemail system.3.2.	Component Provision, Replacement, and UpgradeAll component hardware or software supplied as replacements during remedial maintenance or as part of an upgrade, expansion, or other change must be new standard parts. Components that are no longer manufactured, and for which there are no approved substitutes, may be replaced by refurbished parts so long as they are clean, in good physical condition and function to specification. Replacement components must be of equal or better quality than those being replaced.  The Government reserves the right to provide replacement components for the vendor to install.  3.3.	Warranty / GuarantyAll vendor provided components, software, and installation work must be fully warranted / guarantied for a minimum of 90 days. Where manufacturer and/or vendor provided full warranties and guaranties cover a longer period of time, or where limited warranties and guaranties applicable beyond 90 days are provided, these will apply as well.3.4.	Component AvailabilityThe vendor must stock or have access to all critical components of the systems. These must be kept in locations where they can be quickly and easily obtained when required.3.5.	Escalation ProceduresThe vendor must provide an escalation procedure and contact names and contact numbers that the National Park Service can use in the event that issues arise which cannot be resolved to the National Pak Service's satisfaction in a timely manner by the vendor's service department.3.6.	Laws, Codes and RegulationsAll work and the manner in which it is performed by the vendor must comply with OSHA requirements, the National Electrical Code (2005), and other applicable New York, New Jersey, New York City and federal laws, codes and regulations.3.7.	SecurityThe vendor must operate within the physical and data security rules of the National Park Service or other authorities having jurisdiction.3.8.	SafetyWith regard to work being performed, the vendor must take all necessary safety and health precautions and warnings required to protect its workers, the public, and the property of others.3.9.	Performance and ConductThe vendor must perform all work in a skillful and professional manner in accordance with standards and practices documented and/or accepted by industry or otherwise specified herein.3.10.	SubcontractorsThe vendor must be responsible for any work done by its subcontractors. The vendor must also be responsible for ensuring that its subcontractors comply with all applicable health, safety and security laws, codes, and regulations.3.11.	Sensitivity to Historical and Site EnvironmentAll activities on Ellis Island and Liberty Island must take into account the historical and site specific environment in which work will be preformed. Work that entails the construction of facilities must be in consonance with this requirement. 4.	CURRENT CONFIGURATION4.1.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and FAR Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation N61339-10-T-0014 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and incorporates the provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37. The FSC Code is 5895, and the NAICS Code is 334220.</p>
<p>The Government will set aside 100% of this requirement to a small business entity in accordance with FAR 52.219-6 with a size standard of 750 Employees.</p>
<p>All responsible small business concerns may submit a quotation which, if timely received, will be considered by the Agency.</p>
<p>The following items are required:</p>
<p>Six (6) each 2U Communications Boxes and their accessories (see attached Statement of Work for a detailed description)</p>
<p>Packaging and Delivery</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Origin for pick up within 60 days from contract award.</p>
<p>Evaluation Process</p>
<p>The Government expects to award a firm fixed price commercial purchase order resulting from this combined synopsis to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to this notice will be the most advantageous to the Government. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest priced technically acceptable quote. Best value is expected to result from the selection of the technically acceptable quote with the lowest evaluated price. Technical acceptability will be based on the offeror providing a quote that satisfactorily meets the technical requirements stated in the Scope of Work paragraph above.<br /><br />This contract evaluation and award is a streamlined evaluation and award conducted pursuant to FAR 12.602, FAR 13.106-2, and Subpart 13.5. Under these FAR provisions, the Government is not required to use formal source selection procedures of FAR Subpart 15.3. Accordingly, this contract evaluation and award is not being conducted using formal source selection procedures of FAR Subpart 15.3. The Government has not drafted a formal evaluation plan and does not plan to utilize procedures such as competitive range determinations, oral or written discussions with all offerors within a competitive range. The Government will strive to evaluate each offeror's initial quote fairly, evenly, and in accordance with the solicitation's evaluation criteria. Thus, the offeror's initial quote material should be clear, complete, demonstrate the offeror's full understanding of contract requirements and contain the offeror's best terms, conditions, and prices.<br />A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>The following evaluation criteria shall be used as addenda to FAR 52.252-2: The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. The Government will award a Firm, Fixed Price commercial purchase order resulting from this solicitation. Selection is expected to result from the lowest price, technically acceptable quote. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Capability<br />Factor 2 - Price</p>
<p>Evaluation Process:</p>
<p>1. Each quote that meets the requirements of this solicitation will be evaluated. Evaluations are based on the Offeror's quote.<br />2. All factors shall be evaluated on the completeness, conciseness, and relevance of information provided, as stated in this solicitation.<br />3. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all offers at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all Offerors; and to award a contract to the offeror submitting a quote determined by the Contracting Officer to be most advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Capability</p>
<p>In order to be considered for award, the offeror's technical proposal must be rated as acceptable. To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must demonstrate in their quote that they can meet the requirements as stated in the attached Statement of Work. Failure to submit any of the listed requirements will result in the offeror's technical proposal being determined technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Price</p>
<p>Only price proposals submitted by offerors whose technical proposals are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for evaluation. Proposed prices will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed in FAR 13.106-2 to determine price reasonableness.</p>
<p>The standard is met when the price is determined fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 12.209.</p>
<p>Applicable Clauses &amp; Provisions<br />In accordance with FAR 52.252-1 and FAR 52.252-2, the following solicitation clauses and provisions are incorporated by reference with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

If you have already submitted a proposal, you may submit a revision if necessary.

The following Questions has been received.
Question 1  What is the maximum margin of error that the government will accept for the survey results?
Answer  5%

Question 2  Are there specific minimum response rate requirements applicable to this solicitation?

Answer - Survey Response Rates 
Standard 1.3: Agencies must design the survey to achieve the highest practical rates of response, commensurate with the importance of survey uses, respondent burden, and data collection costs, to ensure that survey results are representative of the target population so that they can be used with confidence to inform decisions. Nonresponse bias analyses must be conducted when unit or item response rates or other factors suggest the potential for bias to occur.
Section 2.3 Data Collection Methodology 
Standard 2.3: Agencies must design and administer their data collection instruments and methods in a manner that achieves the best balance between maximizing data quality and controlling measurement error while minimizing respondent burden and cost.

The OWH does not have it's own definition of more vulnerable. the question to be answered through the research is whether the needs of single parent caregivers in filling their dual roles as single parent and caregiver are greater, different, and how so than the rest of the caregiving population 

Question 4 - When asking the question: when is help most needed for the single parent
caregiver, are you referring to a specific time of day such as managing dropping a child off at
school vs. dropping a parent off at the doctor office? Or is OWH looking for the specific
point in the single parent caregiver's life?  Both

Question 5 -  The question: What can the health care system do to reduce burden, would this
be looking at the perspective of national policy recommendations or would this be specific
items that doctors should be practicing with this sub-population?   Both

Question 6 - Please provide more definition as to what sample journals would meet a peer
reviewed journal requirement.
Answer - By peer-reviewed journal we mean any journal that uses the peer-review
process to select which articles to publish. This is a common practice in journals with a
reputation for publishing high quality research, such as the American Journal of Public
Health.
 
Question 7- Task 9 Page 7 - Is there a minimum number of regression models expected?
Answer - As indicated in the Statement of Work, base your bid on no more than 10 regression models.
(tasks were also numbered incorrectly)

<DESC>This notice has been extended from July 2, 2010 to July 8, 2010 3:00 pm est.<br /><br /><br />The Census Bureau serves as the leading source of quality data about the nation's people and economy. We honor privacy, protect confidentiality, share our expertise globally, and conduct our work openly. We are guided on this mission by our strong and capable workforce, our readiness to innovate, and our abiding commitment to our customers.<br />As part of the process for producing quality data, The Census Bureau would like to enhance the value of the housing data produced from current surveys by obtaining foreclosure records for homes experiencing "mortgage distress" and appending this information to already existing surveys to understand better the characteristics of housing unit and the household members (in the case of occupied units). Providing this information would fill an important gap in knowledge that would help guide developing policy toward housing and housing finance. <br />
<p><br />In Accordance with FAR Part 13(Simplified Acquisitions Procedures), The&nbsp;Bureau of the Census&nbsp;needs to procure a complete existing National Dataset for the year 2009&nbsp;of all housing units that experienced some form of "mortgage distress". Housing units are considered to experience "mortgage distress" should one or more of the following events occur: <br />1. Receive a notice of default<br />2. Receive a notice of trustee sale, or <br />3. They become real-estate owned (REO - bank owned).<br /><br />If a particular housing unit experienced several different stages of mortgage distress in 2009 (and, thus, appears several times in the file), only the most recent stage reported is requested for the proposed foreclosure dataset. <br />Data Requirements<br />At a minimum, each record shall contain the following information:<br />a. Address of affected property<br />i. Street Address<br />ii. Apartment number (if a condo unit)<br />iii. City<br />iv. State<br />v. Zipcode<br />b. Name of borrower<br />c. Date of last action taken<br />d. Status of last action taken ( notice of default, notice of trustee sale, REO)<br />e. Property type (single family, condo, coop)<br />f. Loan amount<br />g. Date action recorded<br />h. Data action entered<br />i. Auction date - if applicable<br />j. Information about the housing unit<br />i. Number of bedrooms<br />ii. Number of bathrooms<br />iii. Square footage of house<br />iv. Number of stories<br />v. Year built<br /><br /><br />Retention: <br />The Census Bureau will retain ownership of the records.<br /><br />Deliverables and Milestone Schedule</p>
<p>Conduct post award telephone conference Within one week after award<br />Receive revised requirements (if necessary) Within one week after award</p>
<p>Receive foreclosure dataset One month after award</p>
<p>Two soft copies of the deliverable on a medium mutually acceptable to the Offeror and the Census Bureau shall be delivered or available via FTP downloand to the Census Bureau on the indicated date. The deliverables will be forwarded or made available via FTP download to the Assistant Division Chief for Housing Characteristics.</p>
<p>Travel Requirements</p>
<p>There are no travel requirements for this project.</p>
<p>Relevant Experience Required<br />The Offeror shall have an existing dataset of foreclosure records that will enable the Offeror to provide the Census Bureau with the necessary data fields for each foreclosure record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Quotations must be submitted to Pamela Miller via email at <a href="mailto:pamela.a.miller@census.gov">pamela.a.miller@census.gov</a>.&nbsp; No phone calls will be honored.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>Amendment #1:&nbsp; Pre-soliciation number should read FA8903-10-R-8013.<br /><br />The Air Force intends to make a restricted source contract award for Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) to allow the placement of orders immediately following the expiration of the current Global Engineering, Integration and Technical Assistance (GEITA) ordering period. This restricted source acquisition will "bridge" the gap between the expiration of existing contracts and the competitively awarded GEITA11 follow on contracts. This will enable AFCEE to continue to provide mission critical A&amp;AS to its Global customer base for environmental restoration and compliance; MILCON, Housing, and SRM; AFRPA, BRAC, and Iraq and Afghanistan areas of responsibility. In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.<br /><br />See "Numbered Note #22" and attached Justification and Approval.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The government reserves the right to hold discussions during the process of product standardization.  In addition, the government reserves the right to cancel this standardization action in its entirety if indicated.

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of IV Administration Sets and Accessories. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  

a.	At a minimum, a complete product line includes, but is not limited to, the functional equivalent in all sizes of the products below:

1. Set IV Administration 20gtt 105inl Vented/Non Vented Drip Chamber Needle Free Portx3 Luer Lock Latex-Free: ©Sl

Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.
2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the IV Administration Sets and Accessories product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
3.	Vendors must have, or be obtaining, a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Owens and Minor) for distribution in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
4.	Vendors must agree to submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  
5.	Vendors must provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address of local vendor representative for the Mid-Atlantic Region. 
6.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the IV Administration Sets and Accessories products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.

11.	Vendors must agree that, when requested, they will provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and competitive product cross reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format 


Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process:

Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who have met the technical/company criteria will progress to the clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples and literature concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. 

Clinical Evaluation Process

For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

The samples to be provided will include as a minimum, but not limited to, the functional equivalent of the following products:

1. Set IV Administration 20gtt 105inl Vented/Non Vented Drip Chamber Needle Free Portx3 Luer Lock Latex-Free: ©Sl
2. Smallbore Extension Set With Smartsite Needleless Valve Port And Luer Lock Adapter. Length 6" Appx.

16. Set IV Extension 17inl Macrobore Injection Port Luer Lock 0.2u Filter Latex-Free: ©Sl

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1.	The drip chamber is clear and allows visualization of drops 
	a. Promotes accurate drip rate to deliver proper amount of fluid/drug prescribed
	b. Evaluator will assess by filling drip chamber and visualizing drops
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
2.	The IV tubing is pliable and is memory free 
	a. Promotes an accurate and timely amount of medication and volume of fluid delivered 	during patient mobility/change in position.
	b. Evaluator will assess by bending and attempting to crimp the tubing
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
3.	IV tubing allows an effective priming speed, flow rate and stopcock function
	a. Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to prime tubing with fluid in an urgent 	care setting for patient care needs.
	b. Evaluator will assess by assembling and utilizing IV set (to include stop cock)
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
4.	The buretrol (or volutrol) graduation allows visualization of an accurate volume level
	a. Promotes an accurate amount of medication and volume of fluid 	delivered to prevent 	fluid overload when indicated.
	b. Evaluator will assess by filling drip chamber and visualizing volume level
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
5.	Product item package identifies the type of IV tubing set 
	a. Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to select the appropriate size for patient 	care needs
	b. Evaluator will assess by visualizing product item packaging
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor [The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.

Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

THE CLOSING DATE IS 19 APRIL 2010 4PM EST.

<DESC><strong></strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amendment 1 posted 6/25/10, requires signed acknowledgement with offer<br /><br /><br />Proposals are DUE July 23, 2010</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions are DUE June 30, 2010</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a requirement for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dynamic Testing of Seat Restraint and Seat Track System for Use in the Ambulance Patient Compartment.</span></p>
<p>Together, NIOSH and the NTEA are continuing to investigate opportunities to improve the structural integrity of the patient compartment, seating systems, the patient litter, and equipment location and mounting utilizing existing NIOSH data. To that end, NIOSH, the NTEA-AMD, and its members have developed an SAE "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Frontal Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment" to characterize the response of an ambulance when subjected to a full frontal crash into a barrier at 30 mph. This proposed document has been approved for further development by SAE and is now in its final revision with a vote to approve and accept as final expected this spring. It should be noted that while this is a standard requirement for all passenger vehicles weighing less than 8,500 lbs (in accordance with Federal Vehicle Motor Vehicle Safety Standards), virtually all U.S. ambulances operate above this weight and are, therefore, largely not required to meet this standard.</p>
<p>Likewise, the partners seek to develop a companion "SAE Recommended Practice" to characterize an ambulance's response in a side impact event. Unfortunately, the team has been unable to identify a dataset in the public domain suitable for use in the development of such a standard. Therefore, a request for proposal was developed and posted in January 2010 to complete this work. A total of four (4) side impact tests will be performed. The resulting dataset will be used to support a well considered and defensible SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Side Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment (proposed). The testing is expected to be conducted in the spring of 2010, with the development of the proposed SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Side Impact Testing expected to be completed and approved by SAE in late fall 2010.</p>
<p>The project team is also now completing development of a new AMD standard, "AMD STANDARD 026 - Proposed - SEAT, SEAT MOUNT AND OCCUPANT RESTRAINT DYNAMIC TEST." This newly proposed AMD standard establishes minimum requirements for testing of all patient compartment designated seating positions, seat mounting systems, and associated occupant restraints when installed per seat and restraint manufacturer's information. This is expected to be performed as a type test.<br />While significant improvements in worker safety are expected as a result of these new standards, seating and restraint industry partners have freely acknowledged they have been unable to locate suitable seat and floor tracks to accommodate the unique mobility needs of EMS workers found during patient care activities. Those mobility needs stem from the nature of the work tasks expected of the EMS worker. Specifically, the EMS worker is expected to be able to address patient needs from head to foot. Given the length of the average person when in a supine position on a gurney, this nearly impossible to do while remaining seated and restrained.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first objective is to investigate alternate floor track designs which would allow the worker to remain seated and restrained while accessing the full length of the patient, from head to toe, on a seat that is able to slide on a track along the length of the patient. The second objective of this contracting effort is to identify or design a seat track that will allow the patient to slide closer to or further from the patient while at a fixed location at the patient's side. The seat will need to lock and remain in place whether impact from the front or rear. Once both track systems have been identified, designed, and manufactured, the floor and seat tracks will be dynamically tested to the latest draft standards as part of a validation of both the test standards and the floor and seat track designs.</p>
<p>II. Project Objectives Related to this Contract</p>
<p>The Contract will conduct a market search to identify viable floor and seat track systems for use in ground ambulances to safely increase EMS worker access to the patient. If viable solutions cannot be identified, the Contractor will propose a new design to meet the challenges of this unique environment. Once designed and manufactured, the Contractor will install two or three different seat and restraint system combinations, supplied by commercial vendors as identified under a separate solicitation. Seating systems utilized will be single standalone seats (captain's chair. At the completion of this design and testing program the Contractor will have:</p>
<p>1. Developed a pedestal mounted seat track that can be be positioned in either a forward facing or aft facing orientation while retaining its ability to lock in place in the event of either a frontal or rear impact.</p>
<p>2. Developed a floor track that allows the worker to travel the length of the patient (e.g., 6 ft) in a track that will lock the seat firmly in place and retain the seat and worker with measured biomechanical values falling below limits specified by AMD STANDARD 026 - Proposed - SEAT, SEAT MOUNT AND OCCUPANT RESTRAINT DYNAMIC TEST".</p>
<p>This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis as full and open competition.</p>
<p>The CDC expects a single award cost plus fixed fee with a period of performance of eighteen (18) months.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at www.fedbizops.gov on or about <strong>May 13, 2010</strong> and proposals will be due on or about <strong>June 14, 2010</strong>. No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of perspective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOpps internet site.</p>

The contractor will recruit skilled personnel from other land management and response agencies, and possibly other countries, to review the agencys response to wildfires.  This might include specialists from the military, academia, industry, and emergency agencies for expertise in land management, wildland fire management, risk management, and large field operations involving ground and air assets and catastrophic threats to the public. 

The contractor will coordinate and oversee the work of the Independent Panel. The panel is tasked with examining and reporting on fire suppression costs for wildfire incidents during Fiscal Year 2009 where federal expenditures exceeded $10,000,000.  The panels purpose will be to determine if the agency exercised fiscal diligence in managing specific incident suppression activities.  This panel is not expected to complete an exhaustive fiscal audit of all incident phases.  Rather, the focus will be on evaluating how these large fires were managed.   The Review objectives for this years panel should focus, as possible, on the following areas:

Evaluating the risk-based management of these large fires from a systems standpoint  from planning and decision-making through implementation and the outcomes that resulted.  For each of these stages, people, skills, and technology should be assessed and what in the system worked well and what in the system needs to be improved should be identified.

Assessing the utilization of new processes, guidance, expectations and tools that have changed the business of fire management in recent years in an effort to determine the impact these changes have had and develop a baseline for comparison in future years as these efforts mature.

Determining whether the agencys current review process is yielding positive changes and identifying ways to improve the agencys current fire review processes.

If the panel finds instances where the agency may not have executed prudent fiscal decisions with respect to public/firefighter safety, natural resource, and private property protection, estimate the proportions of appropriate and excess suppression costs (recognizing that excess costs would be earmarked for return to the treasury based on end of fiscal year 2009 balances). 

Summarize findings in a report to the Secretary of Agriculture.

ALL question(s) shall be forwarded via email to the Contracting Officer listed within this RFP (Request for Proposal) seven (7) calendar days before the closing date of this RFP.  Traudel_haney@nps.gov
__________________________________________________________________
QUESTION:  12.  Each project entry in the Contractor Experience and Past Performance Data Sheet has a place for providing information about "Specific Areas of Experience."  In parentheses at this heading, it notes "identify which of the specific areas identified in M.1 were present on this project."   Section M.1 in the solicitation concerns Evaluation Factors for Award (e.g., price analysis, method of operation, quality control, safety, past performance, etc.).  It is difficult to see how such information relates to "specific areas of experience," which in any case would be exactly the same for most projects.  Something seems to be wrong.  Can you clarify exactly the kind of information the NPS is looking for in this section of the Data Sheet?
 
ANSWER 12.   This is one area you could synopsis the information that you provided within the Proposal.  (ONLY on the Data Sheet)
  Specific areas identified in M.1C Criterion 2, Past Performance 
          1. Recent projects and
          2.  Current Staff Qualifications
          3.  Specialist Support Qualifications

<CONTACT>James H. Kim, Contract Specialist, Phone 7035888203, Email james.kim@whs.mil
<DESC>This procurement is a mini-multiple award construction contract (miniMACC) and is restricted to SBA Certified HUBZone business concerns.  This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award five or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, price and other factors considered. This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his/her properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction and renovation by design-build or design-bid-build of general construction at various locations within Washington Headquarters Services' area of responsibility.  It is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed at the Pentagon Reservation.  The work will primarily be for construction and renovation of facilities, including abatement and handling of hazardous/regulated materials (including and not limited to asbestos and lead paint) and the civil, sanitary, storm water, mechanical and electrical systems and incidental Information Technology (IT), Furniture, Fixtures &amp; Equipment, Move Services, and Energy Management Control related work necessary to provide turnkey solutions. The North American Industry Code Standard (NAICS) is 236220 and the annual size standard is $33.5 million. The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $30,000,000. Task orders are estimated to range between $2,000.01 and $500,000.  Task Orders may fall below or above this limit; however contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $20,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions. 

Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The RFP will be posted on the Fedbizopps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 30 June 2010 under announcement HQ0034-10-R-0025. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE FEDBIZOPPS WEBSITE DAILY FOR ANY AND ALL AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.

<DESC>Recovery - CMS awarded a Task Order under its contract HHSM-500-2010-00001I for Chronic Care Warehouse (CCW) Enhancement to Support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER). The purpose of this Task Order is to enhance the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) and continue to operate the Research Data Distribution Center (RDDC) to support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER). These enhancements will enable CCW to provide a unique data resource to support CER. It will support longitudinal analysis of Medicare data from 1999 through present, link data across the continuum of care, be representative of the full Medicare population, and provide a large enough data set to support the study of small populations and relatively rare events. The Data enhancements will recognized the acquisition of additional hardware and software to have the capability of supporting this larger data warehouse. This will double the size of the Medicare population data in the CCW database and add ten years of dual eligible (Medicare/Medicaid) beneficiaries data to the database. In addition, the contractor will add other data sources to the Medicare administrative data in order to support a broad range of comparative effective projects. It is anticipated that by using a very large administrative claims database and by mining ten years of Medicare/Medicaid utilization data, information can be obtained faster that highlights what works in health care. This information can be used to develop practice guidelines and other methods to promote informed health care decision making. In addition to the CER enhancements, this Task Order includes the purchase of National Death Index data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). CMS has an application with NCHS to obtain this data. The contractor will be responsible for incorporating the data in to the database for CER projects. The period of performance is twenty-four months at $15,500,000 CPFF.

<DESC>RECOVERY - CMS awarded a Task Order under its contract HHSM-500-2010-00001I for Medicaid Analytic Extracts (MAX) Data Warehouse to Support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER). MAX data are person-level data files on Medicaid eligibility, service utilization and payment information. MAX transforms the state-submitted Medicaid and CHIP data into individual-level use and cost research-ready data in five file types: Personal Summary (including eligibility), Inpatient Hospital, Long-Term Care (institutional services), Pharmacy, and Other Services (physician services, therapies, DME, and community long-term care services). <br /><br />MAX Data Warehouse objectives:<br />&bull; Establish a MAX data warehouse and load MAX 1999-2006 data.<br />&bull; Add additional years of MAX data as they become available.<br />&bull; Build a data extraction system to deliver customized MAX data extract files with minimum data necessary to the research community. <br />&bull; Support CER researchers by providing MAX data.<br /><br />MAX files are a version of the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) data for researchers. When fully populated, MAX files combine demographic and claims data from all States to reveal a more optimal picture of activity in and across states that cannot be accomplished through MSIS-submitted data alone without considerable ad hoc data processing. By merging demographic and claims information, and other means of transforming the data, CMS and external data users conduct a variety of studies pertaining to health services research and policy development. The MAX data are an extremely important data source for a number of important CMS research and policy analysis activities. Other Federal agencies and approved users also rely on the MAX database for research and policy analysis related to Medicaid populations. Studies based on these data continue to contribute to empirical research on the impact of the Medicaid and CHIP and contribute to health care policy development presently and, as intended, for the future. The period of performance is twenty-four months at $10,249,783 CPFF<br />
