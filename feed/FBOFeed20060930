This software is in direct support of this initiative and is a strategic element in the overall support provided to consolidation by the Enterprise Server Operations Centers. The use of this software reduces hardware and staff costs by consolidating multiple windows servers onto a single server. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the defined requirements as a key component of IRM/OPS/SIO/EOC’s Virtual Server Architecture. <BR><BR>

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION         The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet A/EX/IRM’s Network Lifecycle Replacement project needs. The HP DL380 G5 server and components meet the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: • Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management • Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health • Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks • Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives • Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers • Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) • CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting • 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives • Systems must have front video/USB ports • Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources • Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION 2        As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. A/EX/IRM has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration. The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Administration Configuration Control Board and will be added to the HW Baseline. The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. <BR><BR>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION 3 As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. A/EX/IRM has selected the HP SB DC7600 workstation because results obtain by A/EX/IRM in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ workstations indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s requirements. The requested workstations will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration. The continued use of HP workstations eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.

The use of name brand is essential to the Government’s requirements for Department of State DS patch dissemination and security compliancy.  The Bureau of Diplomatic Security for the Department of State has a requirement to ensure all workstations in the DS environment are patched and inventoried.  This includes the capability to report on security patch compliance, SW inventory and apply patches to other than Microsoft applications and operating systems. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) and (d)(1)(B)in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development of a major system when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in (i) substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition, or (ii) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the DS's needs.  The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements Shavlik has been tested against Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) and Window System Update Server (WSUS).  While these products provide patch dissemination and reporting on Microsoft patches, it is imperative that DS be capable to apply other than Microsoft patches and also supports other operating systems (i.e. Unix).  Shavlik has the capability to automate the scanning of today's most widely used platforms and products including Windows NT *, XP, 2000, Windows Server 2003, Exchange, SQL Server, Outlook, Microsoft Office, Java Virtual Machine, non-Microsoft product support such as WinZip, Apache and more. Shavlik also has a hierarchical security capability.  This allows certain personnel to push patches, while only allowing others to generate reports or check compliance.DS evaluated Shavlik against the existing implementations of SMS and WSUS to ensure that the services offered were complimentary to the other products, as well as, provided a check and balance to the reporting received from these products. <BR><BR>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell OptiPlex GX520 Minitowers.  The use of Dell personal computers (GX520) is essential to the bureau’s automated information systems (AIS) requirements, for standardization of personal computing capabilities, cost reductions, maintenance and repairs, and compatibility with current network infrastructure configurations, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. OES/EX/IMD has identified the Dell OptiPlex line of personal computers as a key component of the bureaus automated information system. Equipment listed above is required to provide standardized personal computing capabilities to our existing bureau agencies, offices and satellite organizations.  Standardizing our enterprise network infrastructure personal computing capabilities is essential to continue business operations. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the bureau’s requirements as a key component of the bureaus automated information systems. The Dell OptiPlex personal computers have undergone test and assessment, evaluation for IMD deployments and received final approval from the bureaus local IT Configuration Control Board. <BR><BR>
