<DESC>Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR)
Market Survey Data Sheet for Display Manufacturing
October 2017

ANNOUNCEMENT:

In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1 - this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  The responses to this Market Survey should appropriately mark any proprietary information.  This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement, and will not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  If the FAA decides to conduct an open competition, it may limit the competition to only those vendors who respond to this market survey.  This is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) NOR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). The FAA is neither seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.

INTRODUCTION:

The FAA is seeking interested vendors that are capable of providing replacement of the existing Plasma Display of the Ribbon Display Terminal for the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR). The ribbon display modification effort is required to make the existing (or â€œLegacyâ€) display more reliable, as well as, provide the latest technology to accommodate future changes to the system they support. 

The intent of the attached draft specifications and drawings are to define what the TDWR display capabilities currently are and what the minimum requirements are for a replacement display. These document are also intended to provide enough information for interested vendors to decide whether or not they may be capable of providing a replacement display that meets the TDWR systemâ€™s requirements. 

BACKGROUND:

The primary mission of the TDWR is to enhance the safety of air travel through the timely detection and reporting of hazardous wind shear in and near the terminal approach and departure zones of an airport. Specific sources of the hazardous wind shear that are to be detected are microbursts and gust fronts. 

The TDWR Ribbon Displays are alphanumeric displays that provide Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) personnel with concise information on the status of various runway corridors with regard to wind shear and microburst events. Due to a recent increase in failures of the existing displays and to meet the need in supporting the system, acquisition of a new display is necessary. The existing DC plasma displays were designed in the early 1990â€™s. Plasma displays were selected for the ribbon display in order to offer ATC personnel with high contrast, very readable displays well-suited for tower cab environments which have high background light. However, as technology evolves with hardware interfaces and communications protocols, the FAA is looking to move towards a state of the art capability; providing longer, reliable service with low maintenance requirements. 
	
CAPABILITY STATEMENT:

The attached documents are intended to provide enough information for interested vendors to decide whether or not they are capable of providing a replacement Display that meet the TDWR system's requirements. Interested vendors that have the capabilities to manufacture a Display to meet the TDWR's requirements should provide sufficient information to describe those items and capabilities in a compelling manner.  Furthermore, interested vendors are encouraged to recommend economically efficient or new solutions that meet the specifications addressed in the accompanying documents in addition to, providing comments on specifications and drawings

Submitted documentation must clearly demonstrate that the vendor can produce a Display meeting the size, electrical, and reliability/life requirements specified in the accompanying documents. In addition, the submitted documentation should address/demonstrate the following: 

1.	The vendor's ability to provide a prototype/first article(s) Display within a 5-month period. 
2.	The vendor's ability to commence delivery of production Displays within 90 to 120 days of the FAA's notice to proceed once first article testing is completed. 
3.	Rough Order of Magnitude estimate for the production of a first article assembly and five hundred (500) production Display units; include Overhead, General & Administrative (G&A), and Non-Recurring Engineering costs (for market research purposes only). 

SMALL BUSINESS:

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBAâ€™s 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 423610, Electrical Apparatus and Equipment Wiring Supplies and related Equipment Merchant with a size standard of 250 employees.  If you believe that another NAICS code is more appropriate to the work specified in this market survey, include supporting justification with your alternate NAICS code.  Suggestion of an alternate NAICS code does not require that the work be set-aside or solicited under that alternative code.

The FAA will consider information submitted in response to this market survey in determining the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.

The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBAâ€™s 8(a) Program.  

RESPONSES:

Please include the following in your response to this survey:
1.	Capability Statement (not to exceed 20 pages)
2.	Copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form and/or proof of service-disabled veteran-owned small business status (if applicable)
3.	Comments on Specifications and Drawings

<p>Description of Requirement<br />(1) The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) contemplates award of a contract for Snow and Ice Removal Services at the National Weather Service Forecast Office located in Gray, Maine (ME). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 561790. The small business size standard is $7.5 million. The contracting office is contemplating a base year plus four one-year options contract beginning on 1-1-2018. The contractor shall furnish all supervision, labor, materials, supplies and equipment to provide effective and efficient snow, ice, and freezing rain removal services at the National Weather Service Forecast Office (1 Weather Lane Gray, ME). <br /><br />(2) The National Weather Service Office is a 24 hour operation and must have a clear and safe travel path/walkway area during inclement weather conditions for the safety of its employees. Approximated Area Square Footage: The length of the paved access road is approximately fifteen hundred (1500) feet. The approximate area of the parking lot is 6,600 square feet. The approximate area of the apron around the Weather Balloon inflation building is 3,500 square feet. The length of the walkways is approximately 400 feet.<br /><br />(3) The contractor shall: furnish equipment, materials and the personnel which are consistent with the best industry standards for effective and efficient snow removal services; at a minimum, furnish snow plows, blades, blowers, dump truck, shovels, ice picks, snow removal equipment with a blade of 12 feet or greater for snow plowing and availability of a tandem axle dump truck for snow removal.<br /><br />(4) The contractor shall provide complete snow and ice removal services for the NOAA office listed above in accordance with this PWS. It shall be the contractor's responsibility to monitor weather forecasts and conditions and self-initiate removal services. Snow and ice removal services shall be considered "automatic, meaning the contractor shall begin services in accordance with the guidelines in the PWS and contract. A few events may be minor or on the threshold, and the contractor may call the office and see if services are required. There may be days where blowing and drifting of snow require services despite no falling snow occurring.<br /><br />(5) The Contractor shall "automatically" commence plowing and snow removal operations when there is accumulation of two (2) inches of snow and continuously throughout storm (every additional two inches), or any amount of ice. During an event, the contractor shall ensure that the necessary equipment and manpower are at the site and continue with the performance of the snow removal. The goal of the plowing/removal is to show bare pavement with no more than 2" of accumulated snow/sleet/ice at any time on the parking area, roadways, driveways, handicap spaces, and around the Radar site and Weather Balloon inflation building. In addition, plowing and/or removal of snow as needed to provide access to exterior generator building, fuel storage tank, trash enclosure, telephone equipment hut, and exterior equipment pad. The Contractor shall ensure there is a clear path from the weather balloon facility overhead doors to the post used to prepare the weather balloon equipment with a 4 foot clearance around the post and no snow banking. If needed, the Contractor shall shovel areas that the snowplow cannot remove.<br /><br />(6) An application of salt/sand/chemical shall be applied to the cleared areas to reduce hazardous conditions. The contractor shall use due diligence when spreading salt/sand to prevent excessive disbursements on pavement. The contractor shall be responsible for cleanup of any excessive disbursement of salt/sand.<br />When icy conditions exist (sleet/freezing rain, freezing drizzle, black ice), the contractor shall "automatically" apply salt/sand to the parking and driving areas in sufficient amounts to ensure safe walking and driving areas and to reduce safety hazards due to freezing rain and sleet.<br /><br />(7) Snow should be pushed or mechanically blown beyond paved areas of the parking lot and road to prevent eventual encroaching of paved areas from multiple snow events. In the event this is not possible contractor shall make arrangements for disposal and/or removal of snow off site to an approved snow landfill if room is not available at the current location and/or ponding of melting snow occurs on paved areas.<br /><br />(8) During a major snow event, Contractor shall remove snow continuously for every 2 additional inches during a storm seven days per week, between the hours of 0500 to 2300. Special attention should be paid to the following times: 7 a.m., 3p.m. and 10p.m. This is typically when shift changes occur and the road from Rt. 231 into the parking lot and sidewalks must be clear for employee safety. Special salting/sanding attention is needed at the base of Weather Lane where it meets route 231. This area is at the base of a hill and poses a danger of vehicles sliding onto route 231 if they can't stop due to poor road conditions.<br />Note: For events that require post storm clean up, including snow/ice buildup in/or along parking lot &amp; roadway that create hazardous conditions, the contractor shall provide final plowing/removal/sand &amp; salting services within 36 hours of the end of the event. Examples include: snow encroaching into parking lot, narrowing of roads, obstruction of vision, slippery conditions etc.).<br /><br />(9) A Snowfall event is defined as: The total accumulation of snow as indicated by the National Weather Service for the area of Gray, Maine from the beginning to the end of a snowfall period and reported by the National Weather Service at: http://www.weather.gov/gyx/. This site shall be used to determine the snowfall in inches. Note that event snowfall may span more than one calendar day. For example it may snow from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. thereby falling on two calendar days.<br /><br />(10) Contractor shall perform all services diligently and in a good, professional and first class manner, using good quality materials, equipment and workmanship and sufficient trained personnel (including supervisors when appropriate) to complete the services in a safe and timely manner which does not unduly interfere with the operation of the Property, the businesses therein and their suppliers. Contractor shall obtain and maintain, at its expense and at all times during the term of the contract, all necessary licenses, permits, training or other authorizations which may be necessary to perform the services. The intent of this requirement is to remove all snow and ice from driveways, parking areas, sidewalks and handicapped accessibility areas. The contractor shall perform snow removal more than once during a snowfall period if needed to keep up with the accumulation of snowfall, however, the basis for payment will be the total snowfall in inches per storm and not the amount of effort expended by the contractor.

<DESC>The US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate a sole source cost plus fixed fee contract with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) for support to the development, integration, test, demonstration, enhancement, and operation and maintenance efforts on the Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), and Line of Sight Communications (LOS Comms). The EW/IO/LOS Comms multifunction system, developed jointly by NGC and NRL exploits the synergy between these three functions to maximize the efficiency of the common elements under a single resource allocation manager (RAM) and over that portion of the spectrum where the requirements and capabilities for Onboard EW, IO and LOS Comms overlap. The associated Multifunction Electronic Warfare (MFEW) system, also developed by Northrop Grumman and NRL, provides Electronic Support (ES) detection and tracking information to EW/IO/Comm.
<p><br />The EW/IO/Comm and MFEW ADM systems are installed at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Chesapeake Bay Detachment (CBD) and operate together as an integrated multifunction RF system. This combined multifunction ADM is the prototype for the Ship Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) AN/SLQ-32(V)7 and a technology basis for future follow-on Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command &amp; Control (EMC2) multifunction development. As such it is planned that the EW/IO/Comm and MFEW ADMs will be used by ONR and other Navy, DoD and Industry partners to develop and demonstrate new technologies, concepts and operational tactics.</p>
<p>NRL requires support to assist the Government in the development of these new technologies, concepts and tactics; in the operation of the system; in the performance of demonstrations; in the integration and test of new user hardware and/or software; and the maintenance, repair and enhancement of the subject multifunction systems. This effort will also provide a path to transition long term support, operation, maintenance, enhancement and configuration control to NRL and other Government developers and technical personnel.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The contractor will primarily utilize a technical assistance approach to reform Benin's regulatory systems, strengthen healthcare administration and advocacy, as well as a direct service delivery model as it works towards the goal of increasing the utilization of high impact reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) services and products delivered by the private sector nationwide.<br /><br />The following types of technical assistances are required by the Agency in relation to the private sector:
<p>1. Expanded volume of quality, high impact RMNCH services delivered by private sector providers</p>
<p>&bull; Significantly increase the number of registered private facilities and licensed providers<br />&bull; At least one-third (35%) are RMNCH accredited <br />&bull; 50% of registered health facilities routinely reporting on high impact RMNCH services into the national Health Management Information System (HMIS)<br /><br />2. Increase availability of key, quality health products at different price points through private sector channels</p>
<p>&bull; Increased volume (i.e., gross unit sales) of quality key RMNCH products in the private sector at the department level <br />&bull; Improved regulatory environment for key RMNCH products<br /><br />3. Strengthen public-private engagement to promote attainment of universal RMNCH outcomes</p>
<p>&bull; Increased leadership, management and governance capacity of the Platform <br />&bull; Biannual landscape of Benin's private health care regulations produced<br /><br />4. Integrate and disseminate innovative, tested, and emerging private sector models</p>
<p>&bull; At least one innovative, tested and emerging private sector model applied</p>
<p>This activity will play a vital role in supporting the USG's and Agency's goal of achieving of expanding access to high impact interventions and ultimately reducing preventable deaths by expanding delivery of high impact reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) services and products through the private sector . Working with private sector health associations, providers, pharmacists, wholesalers, NGO's, market research companies and the government, USAID aims to strengthen the quality of high impact RMNCH health services and products nationwide. A key approach to this effort is improving regulatory environment to enable a stronger private health sector as well as expand public-private partnerships.</p>

<DESC><p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers
Late submission of offers are outlined at FAR Parts 52.212-1(f) and 52.215-1(c).  Particular attention is warranted to the portion of the provision that relates to the timing of submission.

Please see FAR 15.207(c) for a description of the steps the Government shall take with regard to unreadable offers.

To avoid rejection of an offer, vendors must make every effort to ensure their electronic submission is virus-free.  Submissions or portions thereof submitted and which the automatic system detects the presence of a virus or which are otherwise unreadable will be treated as  unreadable  pursuant to FAR Part and FAR 15.207(c ). 

Password protecting your SF-330 is not permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated Government individuals.

The selection of the most qualified contractor will follow the guidance provided in FAR 36.6   Architect-Engineer Services.  Additionally, this solicitation is also issued in accordance with Public Law 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare Information and Technology Act of 2006, Sections 502 and 503, as a set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) contractors. Pursuant to 38 USC 8127(d), competition is restricted to SDVOSB construction firms, as there is a reasonable expectation that two or more offers from SDVOSB contractors will be received under this solicitation. 

Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status and ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status. Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz.gov at the time SF-330s are submitted, when the proposal is received as a result of the solicitation issued to the most qualified firm, and on the date of contract award will result in the offeror s proposal/SF-330 being deemed not acceptable. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

The Government will not pay, nor reimburse, any costs associated with responding to this request. The Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.

Contract Award Procedure: At time of award, the contractor must be certified by VetBiz and registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. Register via the SAM internet site at www.sam.gov. Failure of an SDVOSB to be VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE in VetBiz shall result in elimination from consideration as a potential contract awardee.

The proposed services will be obtained by a Negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract. 

The review/design of architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the work shall be accomplished by architects or engineers registered in a State or possession of the United States, or in Puerto Rico or in the District of Columbia.

<DESC>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential manufacturing sources and to determine if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside. This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research. No funds are available to fund the information solicited.
<p>The 421St Supply Chain Management Squadron located at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for the manufacture of the NSN(s) listed below. The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. Qualification requirements exist and can be located in FedBizzOps. A Source Approval Request (SAR) package must be submitted for approval determination to the Oklahoma City Small Business Office. Consequently, potential sources for this effort are companies who have a licensing agreement with the Data Rights Holder or Original Equipment Manufacturer. The company must have manufactured the Subject or Similar item within the past 36 months for the Original Equipment Manufacturer or Department of Defense and intends to produce Subject item to the Subject technical data.</p>
<p>The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 336412, which has a corresponding Size Standard of 1,500 employees. The Government is interested in all businesses to include, Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Businesses 8(a)s, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Hubzone Businesses, and Women-Owned Small Businesses. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime, and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>

<CONTACT>Mohn, Robert L.
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to TA Instruments for an Annual Maintenance Service agreement for the following TA Instruments Thermogravimetric Analysis Equipment, Q600 SDT Simultaneous DSC-TGA and Discovery TGA: 

1. Product #999800.602; LSP Q400 Q500 TGA 550 Q600, Q800; Serial #600-1668
2. Product #999800.613; LSP DDSC DSC 2500; Serial #TGA1-0378.
3. Product #999800.048 - EXTENDED WARRANTY THERMAL ACCT; Serial # DCC1-00613.

The base period of performance will be for the date after award through March 31, 2019, and include up to three, one-year option periods through March 31, 2022. This is considered a sole source to TA Instruments because, to the best of the NETLâ€™s knowledge, based on market research conducted TA Instruments is the only known source that can provide this exact maintenance agreement.  TA Instruments Is the only company that can service, repair, and provide software upgrades and maintenance to their equipment to maintain the peak performance and operational availability. Service and maintenance must be performed by the original equipment manufacturer, TA Instruments, and their trained staff.  The current equipment continues to have a useful life and failure to continue the maintenance agreement will put NETL at risk of failure or loss of service that could severely impact the organizationâ€™s ability to operate in an efficient and effective manner.  The maintenance agreement is proprietary to TA Instruments.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL's requirement. 
 
This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal. Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 5:00 PM ET on November 15, 2017. Responses must be submitted in writing to the Contract Specialist, Robert Mohn, via email at Robert.Mohn@netl.doe.gov no later than the time and date noted above. Telephone responses and requests will not be received.  
 
A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any). <br />8. Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building. <br />9.

<p>The COEs are directly aligned with one or more of the DHS Components, creating linkages between DHS and other customers, as well as providing enduring multi-disciplinary research, development, testing, evaluation, education and training capabilities for DHS and the nation. The COEs are authorized by Congress and chosen by the DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) through a competitive selection process. The designation of "Center of Excellence" is awarded to a university that brings together leading experts and researchers from other institutions, agencies, laboratories, think tanks, and the private sector to conduct multidisciplinary research and education for homeland security solutions.</p>
<p>The S&amp;T OUP's mission is to maximize DHS's return on investment in university-based research and education. OUP funds grants and cooperative agreements to the COEs to establish fundamental research and education programs in specific multi-disciplinary subject matter areas at each COE (see Exhibit 1 below). DHS S&amp;T expects the universities that comprise the COEs to obtain additional sources of funding beyond OUP's base funding in order to support more directed research, development, testing, evaluation, education and training. Other S&amp;T Divisions and DHS Components frequently need to access the capabilities created by the COEs at the lead or partner universities, e.g. for directed research, analysis, technical services, both unclassified and classified, as well as DHS-specific education and training that cannot be performed under S&amp;T's grants and cooperative agreements. Through this RFI, DHS S&amp;T is pursuing funding strategies to meet emerging requirements.</p>
<p>1.2 Discussion</p>
<p>DHS S&amp;T seeks responses on the use of 2 (two) Basic Ordering Agreements to accommodate DHS requirements for COE research, analysis, and technical services (unclassified and classified), as well as DHS-specific science and engineering education and training. DHS S&amp;T anticipates awarding BOAs to each current and future COE research lead university, to be renewed once after five years, and again at the end of their periods of performance, both renewals being subject to suitable COE progress in research, development, test, evaluation, education and training. OUP will determine the need for a BOA for each COE research lead by matching university capabilities with DHS's requirements and needs (S&amp;T will address high priority requirements first).</p>
<p>Two (2) new DHS COEs were established in 2017. Exhibit 1 identifies those Centers. BOAs enable DHS components to access the capabilities, experience, research results, technology, models and data that the COEs have developed with DHS funding.<br />Characteristics:<br />o Versatile umbrella agreements between DHS and performing institutions (one lead university from each COE)<br />o Enables Contracting Officers within the funding agency to issue task orders to the performer that are within the scope of the BOA<br />o Designed to address the needs of DHS for specific research questions with deliverables on an identified cost and schedule performance<br />o Awarded for a five year period of performance</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Exhibit 1:<br /><br /><strong>Centers of Excellence (COE):</strong></p>
<p>1. Center for Accelerating Operational Efficiency <strong>(CAOE)</strong><br />2. Center for Criminal Investigations and Network Analysis<strong> (CINA)</strong></p>
<p><strong>COE Subject Matter Area:</strong></p>
<p>1. CAOE: Data Analytics (including Data Visualization and Predictive Analytics), Operations Research and Systems Analysis, Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events and Natural Events and Natural Hazards, and Risk Sciences and Analysis (including Risk Assessment and Risk Management) of Terrorism Events and Natural Hazards</p>
<p>2. CINA: Criminal Network Analysis (including characteristics of criminal networks, interdependencies and linkages, influences and other impacts, and illicit supply and value chains) Dynamic Patterns of Criminal Activities (including crime trend analysis and mapping), Forensics (Traditional/Digital), Criminal Investigative processes (including measures of effectiveness)</p>
<p><strong>Key DHS Partners:</strong></p>
<p>Multiple DHS Partners - U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, United States Coast Guard, United States Secret Service, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and Science and Technology Directorate</p>
<p>The task/delivery orders issued under the BOAs will be issued non-competitively to the respective BOA recipients. The total estimated 5-year combined value of all orders issued under both BOAs is five to ten million dollars ($5M-$10M). Experience indicates that current projects have been in the range of $25,000 to $1,000,000 in value. The value of task orders under new BOAs may be lower or higher. DHS S&amp;T anticipates that the COE research lead universities will use BOA subcontracts with current or new organizations to access the best possible skills, knowledge, and capabilities needed to address each task order.</p>
<p>The DHS Office of Procurement Operations (OPO) S&amp;T Acquisition Division will issue and administer the BOAs. DHS Components' contracting offices will issue and administer their respective task orders under the BOAs, subject to a determination by the S&amp;T Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) that the requested research services are within the scope of the relevant BOA. The BOAs will contain pertinent terms and conditions that will facilitate the issuance of fixed price or cost reimbursement type task orders as determined by the ordering Contracting Officer of the relevant DHS component.</p>
<p>Contracting Officers at DHS offices and Components will be able to issue task orders under the COE BOAs for unclassified or classified research, scientific or technical analyses, and technical services related to homeland security challenges and solutions. Orders will fit within the broad scope of COE capabilities and may include:</p>
<p>a) Creating technologies and models<br />b) Utilizing facilities and technologies<br />c) Providing subject matter expert review, presentation, or testimony<br />d) Testing and evaluation<br />e) Conducting analyses or assessments<br />f) Developing and delivering education and training materials<br />g) Performing other relevant services within an existing COE scope of work.</p>
<p>2.0 RESPONSES REQUESTED</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory Responses/Questions:</strong><br /><br />1. Describe your university's/organization's knowledge, experience, and capacity to administer FAR-based contracts and, in particular, Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs).<br />2. Describe your university's/organization's willingness to accept a FAR-based BOA and task/delivery orders under the BOA in fulfillment of future DHS research, analysis, and technical services requirements.<br />3. Does the award of a BOA impose a burden on your university/organization and on your partner organizations that you cannot accommodate given your institution's current skills, capabilities, experience, and resources? Please explain.<br />4. Which FAR-based contract type is preferred for orders issued under a BOA, if awarded to your university/organization for COE-related research, analysis, and technical services? [For example: Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Cost Reimbursement Plus No Fee (Cost-No Fee).] Please rank in order from most preferred to least preferred of the contract types listed above.<br />5. Are you willing and able (having the necessary facilities, practices, and procedures) to accept and perform sensitive but unclassified (SBU) task orders under a FAR-based BOA? <br />6. Are you willing and able (having the necessary facilities, practices, procedures, etc.) to accept and perform classified task orders under a FAR-based BOA?<br />7. Describe your understanding and management practices for advancing technologies in the disciplines identified in Exhibit 1. This includes describing processes in use at the submitting university/organization that manages the advancement of research through commercialization and market deployment.<br />8. Describe the kinds of research, analysis, and technical service projects that your COE/organization might perform for DHS Components under the aforementioned BOAs. Please submit project examples.<br />9. What other questions or concerns should DHS S&amp;T consider with respect to implementing this BOA contracting approach?<br />10. Since research performed under these BOAs will address DHS mission needs, the availability of the results of such research for publication might be limited. Does this present an issue?<br />11. Are there any issues regarding intellectual property rights that DHS should consider as it prepares its BOAs for issuance? DHS expects to use the FAR clause on data rights 52.227-14. Pursuant to that clause, DHS expects to review scientific articles prior to publication to ensure that DHS's security &amp; mission needs are considered.</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in November.   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />The Open Period for November is November 1, 2018 to November 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and  each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG03 and must be located within Region 3.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years.<br /></p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<p>The Open Period for November is November 1, 2017 to November 7, 2017, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG09 and must be located within Region 9.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

Subject Line: 36C25618Q0107 -Pharmacogenetic Testing Source Sought Response  

Background:
Overton Brooks VA Medical Center requires the capacity to order pharmacogenetic testing on Veterans who are on polypharmacy or who present with medication resistance or medication sensitivity. These tests will assess for the presence of genetic variants responsible for adverse drug reactions. 
A recent study completed a retrospective analysis of patients with known metabolic liver enzyme genotypes. They found 1053 potential major or substantial interactions in 501 of 1143 (~44%) individuals. Of these, 66% were drug-drug interactions, 15% were drug-gene interactions, and 19% were drug-drug-gene interactions. This is important because these interactions are closely linked to adverse drug reactions. 
According to the FDA and Center for Disease Control and Prevention, adverse drug reactions are a major preventable public health problem that cost billions of dollars and affect millions of individuals every year. It is estimated that adverse drug reactions are responsible for approximately 100,000 deaths yearly and are the fourth to sixth leading cause of death in the USA. (Source: CDC, FDA, Verbeurgt et. al., Pharmacogenomics (2014) 15(5), 655 665).

<DESC><strong>MARKET RESEARCH</strong>
<p><strong>Request for Information (RFI)<br />W912HQ-18-SN-0001<br />Navigation Data and Systems:<br />Analytical and Professional Support Services</strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR THE UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS (USACE), INSTITUTE FOR WATER RESOURCES (IWR) IN ALEXANDRIA, VA.</strong></p>
<p>This announcement is made by the US Army Corps of Engineer's Humphreys' Engineer Center Support Activity (HECSA), the IWR's cognizant Contracting Office, and is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the Government's needs with regard to the planned execution of a Navigation Data and Systems Analytical and Professional Support Services contract. It is anticipated that this effort will result in the award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple-Award Task Order (MATOC) contract with a Base Year plus four (4) Option Years. The estimated price ceiling for this requirement is approximately $48M.</p>
<p>The Institute for Water Resources (IWR) was formed 47 years ago to provide the USACE Civil Works Program with the capability to analyze and anticipate emerging Navigation trends and issues facing our nation. From its beginnings, one of the core missions of IWR has been to support the Corps Navigation program, including both deep and shallow draft coastal and inland systems in the United States and worldwide. Navigation is the largest Corps Business Line, in terms of value, representing about 45 percent of the Corps Civil Works budget. IWR has been tackling the Navigation data and systems challenges coming from an ever increasing demand for products and services transported by water. As such, there remains a compelling need for analytical and professional support to pursue innovative approaches to solving these new problems. IWR is a Field Operating Activity (FOA) under the supervision and direction of the Deputy Commanding General for Civil and Emergency Operations (DCG-CEO) and Director of Civil Works (DCW) for USACE. IWR's challenging mission remains integral to shaping the evolution of Federal Navigation policy as decision-makers at all levels within USACE look to IWR for insights into a host of complex physical, economic, environmental and social issues.</p>
<p>HECSA is seeking information on companies that have the capability to provide technical and analytical support services for the Institute for Water Resources that is generally not available within the USACE. The scope of this effort is intended to encompass all aspects of the Civil Works Navigation mission area and other mission areas that connect with Navigation (including Flood Risk Management, Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration, Hydropower, Regulatory, Recreation, and Water Supply, etc.) as well as support to this USACE mission.</p>
<p>The primary contractor support services required are in the following performance area requirements (functional areas):</p>
<p>1. Navigation Studies and Assessments (PWS Part 3.1)<br />2. Navigation Decision Support Systems and Tools (PWS Part 3.2)<br />3. Navigation Data, Collection and Analytical Methodologies, Tools, and Models (PWS Part 3.3)<br />4. Navigation Outreach, and Training Services (PWS Part 3.4)<br />5. Decision Support, Analyses, and Assessments (PWS Part 3.5)<br />6. Future Directions Assessments (PWS Part 3.6)</p>
<p>The level of support required varies by each task order, however, in many cases future task orders will require an integration of expertise from a wide variety of these functional areas.</p>
<p>USACE is requesting two (2) specific areas of information be supplied by interested vendors:</p>
<p>1. Comments and Suggestions for the Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) which has been uploaded as Attachment # 1.</p>
<p>2. Capability Statements in response to this RFI, which should include as a minimum the following:</p>
<p>a) A description of the capabilities that demonstrate the interested firm's ability to support the multiple functional areas listed above, [limit 3 pages]</p>
<p>b) A description of company history with regard to (a) how multidisciplinary experience was obtained or developed and (b) types and/or combination of types of awarded contract vehicles (e.g. Cost Reimbursement, IDIQ, Fixed Price, Fixed Price Level of Effort, Time &amp; Materials, etc.). Please submit contract numbers for any completed/in-progress contract of similar work.[limit 10 pages];</p>
<p>c) A description of the degree of teaming needed to meet the requirements listed above, including an estimated percentage of subcontracted partners[limit 1 page];</p>
<p>d) Brief discussion of Key Personnel and their experience with the functional areas.</p>
<p>e) Identify whether you are a small or large business with regard to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541618.</p>
<p><br />This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a solicitation, is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and will not be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the capability statements received. No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.

<p>NAICS Code:<br />221122 Electric Power Distribution<br />221210 Natural Gas Distribution<br />221310 Water Supply and Irrigation Systems</p>
<p>1. Contract Information: The U.S. Government is the nation's single largest energy consumer. Due to the magnitude of funds spent on energy in support of Government operations and the steady inflation of such costs, the Government is re-evaluating its operations and reducing its energy consumption. The primary purpose of the proposed acquisition is to acquire the design, implementation, and operation of a Utility Energy Services Contract (UESC) project for Fort Polk, Louisiana.</p>
<p>2. Background: 10 U.S.C. 2913 Energy Savings Contracts and Activities, is the overarching bill for shared energy savings contracting for the DOD. The Secretary of Defense through Defense Energy Program Policy Memorandum (DEPPM) 91-2 dated March 19, 1991, directed the Secretary of the Army to coordinate with the Secretaries of the Navy and Air Force and with the heads of Defense Agencies to develop an integrated strategy for all Components within the service territory of each utility to coordinate activity and maximize savings. DEPPM 94-1, issued December 20, 1993, establish the guidelines for participation in Energy Conservation and Demand Side Management (EC/DSM) programs offered by or to be negotiated with public utilities. 42 U.S.C. 8256 provides information relating to utility incentive programs. Four key elements of this section are highlighted below.</p>
<p>- Agencies are authorized and encouraged to participate in programs to increase energy efficiency and water conservation or manage electricity demand conducted by gas, water, or electric utilities and generally available to customers of such utilities.</p>
<p>- Each agency may accept any financial incentive, goods, or services generally available from any such utility, to increase energy efficiency or to conserve water or manage electricity demand.</p>
<p>- Each agency is encouraged to enter into negotiations with electric, water, and gas utilities to design cost-effective demand management and conservation incentive programs to address the unique needs of facilities utilized by such agency.</p>
<p>- If an agency satisfies the criteria that generally apply to other customers of a utility incentive program, such agency may not be denied collection of rebates or other incentives.</p>
<p>2. Description of the Requirement: The requirement at Fort Polk, Louisiana, is for comprehensive UESC services not limited to these Energy Conservation Measures:</p>
<p>Building envelope energy conservation.</p>
<p>HVAC system replacements and upgrades to include HVAC Direct Digital Controls (DDC), controls and re-commissioning.</p>
<p>Boiler and connected systems improvements..</p>
<p>Chilled and connected systems improvements.</p>
<p>District heating and cooling system re-commissioning to include operation, maintenance and repairs.</p>
<p>Motors, drives and connected controls improvements.</p>
<p>Space heating improvements.</p>
<p>Steam system improvements.</p>
<p>Natural gas system improvements.</p>
<p>Lighting retrofitting and controls.</p>
<p>Water conservation measures and leak detection.</p>
<p>Advanced metering to include network connectivity.</p>
<p>3. Project Information:</p>
<p>A UESC is a contracting vehicle that allows agencies to accomplish energy savings projects for their facilities without up-front capital costs and without special Congressional appropriations to pay for the improvements. Under a UESC contract, the selected UESC utility provider (Utility) will provide their own funding, provide financed funding, or a combination of their own and financed funding, for an energy conservation project that will be repaid from utility bill savings. The Utility will conduct a comprehensive energy audit to identify improvements that will result in energy savings. With coordination and approval of the Government, the Utility will design and construct an energy savings project and provide assurance that the improvements will result in savings sufficient to pay for the project over a maximum 25 year repayment period. The Utility will also develop a savings assurance plan and arrange project financing. The project energy savings will be measured over the course of the financing period.</p>
<p>4. Submission Requirements: The Government does not intend to rank submittals or reply to interested companies/firms. This synopsis is for Market Research purposes only and is not a Request For Proposal (RFP) or a Request For Quote (RFQ). The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.

SCOPE: 

The scope of this effort falls in line with VA s mission, goals, and objectives in support of providing Veterans  care. Pneumatic Tourniquet is a constricting or compressing device, specifically a bandage, used to control venous and arterial circulation to an extremity for a period of time.  Modern pneumatic tourniquets have three basic components: an inflatable cuff, a compressed gas source, and an instrument which automatically monitors and controls cuff pressure.  The cuff is secured around the limb proximal to the operative site.  Pressure is exerted on the circumference of the limb by means of compressed gas which is introduced into the tourniquet cuff by a microprocessor-controlled source, via connection tubing. When sufficient pressure is exerted, vessels and arteries beneath the cuff become temporarily occluded, preventing blood flow past the cuff. While the cuff is inflated, the tourniquet system automatically monitors and maintains the pressure chosen by the user.

This requirement will be IAW FAR clause 52.211-6,  Brand Name or Equal  which requires that the offeror indicate each product that is being offered as an  equal  product. For each equal product, the offeror must include a description reflecting the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics of the equal product(s) specified in the solicitation. The offeror also must clearly identify the item by brand name (if any) and make/model number. Finally, the offeror must include descriptive literature, such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the contracting officer, and clearly describe any modifications it plans to make to a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements.
 
See attachment for Contract Line Item Numbers along with Salient Characteristics, P/N and description which will be in the proposed solicitation. 

DISCLAIMERS: 

The VA will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to: 

1) Provide the commodity consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; 
2) Secure and apply the full range of corporate financial, human capital, and technical resources required to successfully perform similar requirements; 
3) Implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with delivery schedules; and meeting the rigid listed specifications.

The authority permitting a sole source acquisition is FAR 6.302-1- "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."

Lockheed Martin also possesses a unique understanding of the complex airframe and its operation with multiple classified sensors.

The program supports<br />development of: (1) new toxicants or the adaptation of existing toxicants to relevant vectors; (2) new insecticide application techniques; and (3) new personal protection tools that prevent<br />human-vector contact. Ideally the research would support the development, evaluation and registration of new insecticides, or improved formulations of existing insecticides for vector control, new technology or enhanced modalities of personal protection from biting arthropods, or would improve the efficacy and sustainability of equipment for application of pesticides for vector control in a military operational environment. Research should be product oriented, consisting of applied research related to a particular product, field evaluation of products for military uses, or research directed towards the development of an existing product for commercial manufacture. Research should not include advanced product development, to include modifying existing product for new use. For any pesticide products supported by the<br />DWFP Program, such products must be registered with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or EPA registration must be intended for products without current EPA<br />registration. The research must be primarily applicable to the military, but products should be transferable to civilian uses. The FY18 DWFP Program does not support the following research:<br />topical repellents, treated fabrics, surveillance tools (including arthropod traps), UAV and drone technologies, and mosquito larvicides.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that approximately $4,500,000 will be awarded in FY18, with future years subject to the availability of funds. The total proposed cost for each pre-proposal cannot exceed $300,000 per year for up to 3 years (total project maximum $900,000), inclusive of direct and indirect costs. Funding is intended to be provided in April 2018. Projects will be selected on the basis of peer-reviewed scientific merit and programmatic relevance determined by a technical committee representing the Armed Forces Pest Management Board and the military services. Pre-proposals will be accepted from investigators who are employed by or affiliated with an eligible institution. Eligible institutions include for-profit, non-profit, public, and private organizations in any country. Examples include universities, hospitals, laboratories, companies, and agencies of local, state government. Federal Agencies may also respond to this request; however, federal requests will be processed in accordance with applicable regulations. The preproposal form is available at http://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/afpmb/docs/dwfp/preproposal_form.pdf. Follow the directions on the form for submission to the AFPMB webmaster. Pre-proposal forms must be submitted no later than December 11, 2017, 12:00 p.m. EST. Late submissions will not be considered. The estimated timeline for the FY18 DWFP Program is as follows:<br />&bull; December 11, 2017 (12:00pm EST): Deadline for pre-proposals <br />&bull; Approx. January 8, 2018: Invitation to submit full proposals &bull; Approx. February 20, 2018: Deadline for full proposals<br />&bull; Approx. March 30, 2018: Notification of acceptance for full proposals<br />&bull; April 2018: Funds awarded<br />Complete instructions for submitting full proposals will be provided separately in a formal<br />notification.<br />Link to Full Announcement<br />The attached funding opportunity description is the full announcement.

<DESC><p>The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) of the Library of Congress administers a free library service to eligible residents of the United States and citizens living abroad who cannot hold, handle, or read traditional print media because of visual or physical disabilities.</p>
<p>Under a special exemption of the U.S. copyright law and with the cooperation of authors and publishers who grant permission to use noncovered copyrighted works NLS annually selects, purchases, and produces (using federal funds) about 4,000 full-length books and 77 magazines in braille and protected digital audio formats. The NLS Union Catalog provides access to more than 235,100 titles in alternate formats, most of them produced by NLS and its affiliated network libraries. Anticipated reader demand determines the number of copies produced for any title. Once a title has been created, digital cartridges are mass produced under contract and distributed to 100 regional and subregional libraries across the United States. NLS also makes more than 98,000 audio and electronic braille publications available for download on its protected website, BARD.</p>
<p>The proposed vendor, Blackstone Audio, will provide proprietary commercial audiobooks to the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped under this agreement and pursuant to individual orders placed by authorized personnel. Books will be provided on an as-needed basis for a yearly period of performance. Books are selected by professional staff of the NLS Collection Development Section and assigned to NLS contractors to NLS that supply introductory and closing announcements and to bring the books into conformity with NLS specifications.</p>

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service has chosen to cancel the current VIPR pre-season I-BPA's for National Crew Carrier Buses (awarded under solicitation AG-024B-S-14-7000) in accordance with Section C.3.3 of that agreement. The current Agreement's will remain in effect until such time that the new Agreements are awarded (estimated 2nd quarter fiscal year 2018). The reasoning for this cancellation is that there are new safety requirements that need to be incorporated into the specifications for Crew Carrier Buses provided under this agreement. These changes were out of scope and could not be done under the current agreement. There is a current synopsis posted to FBO.gov for the new requirement 12024B-18-Q-7000 (originally posted incorrectly as 12024B-Q-18-7000). The draft specifications for this requirement can be found at https://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/solicitations.php .
<p>Please hold any questions related to these specifications until the solicitation is posted.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The United States Geological Survey (USGS), Hydrologic Instrumentation Facility (HIF) intends to award a non&shy;competitive indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery (IDIQ) contract, to Eureka Water Probes, located in Austin, Texas, for equipment and instruments that measure water level at USGS stream flow gauging stations and store and telemeter data obtained at those stations, and the maintenance, repair, and calibration of such instruments, to be delivered to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, for a period of five years from the date of award. There are no option periods.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of &nbsp;FAR 6.302-1 &ldquo;Only One Responsible Source and No Other&rdquo; supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. All responsible sources may submit a proposal or capability statement by no later than 15 November 2017, which shall be considered by the agency. However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. An award will be made on or about 30 November, 2017.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The USGS HIF supports the collection of hydrologic data throughout the USGS by evaluating, procuring, and quality-assuring a wide variety of specialized instruments and equipment. USGS hydrologic data is collected, maintained, and interpreted by USGS Water Science Centers throughout the United States and its territories. In aggregate, these Water Science Centers operate networks over 7500 continuous record stream gages, 10,000 ground water level monitoring stations, and 2500 water quality stations. Data collected from these monitoring sites are widely used by resource managers, regulators, scientists, engineers, consultants, and the general public to effectively and responsibly use and manage the nation&rsquo;s water resources. All data are collected using standard techniques and methodologies, are subjected to rigorous quality assurance checks, and are maintained in a national database containing records that date back to the 19th century. These data are publicly available via the internet, and are extremely valuable because they can be directly compared across broad spatial and temporal scales.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All equipment and instruments to be procured under this contract are commercial items that are essential components of the USGS national stream gaging network described in the preceding paragraph. This network, and the data it produces, is a major element of the overall mission of the USGS. The equipment and instruments required for the operation of this network are highly specialize and must meet rigorous requirements for accuracy, operation in demanding field conditions, and interoperability with existing network infrastructure. These instruments and equipment are essential to the effective operation of the network and are also needed to add new stations as programs evolve. In every sense of the term this network is a major system that represents a major investment of resources through time by the agency.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is very likely that an award to another source would result in substantial duplication of cost that would not be made up from any savings associated with competition. Based market research, historical data, and consultation among USGS water science centers, the total estimated duplication cost associated with each piece of equipment ranges anywhere from $200,000 to $400,000. At the field technician level, the additional costs incurred at are recurring and would continue to be incurred in future years, albeit at lower levels as technicians became more familiar with new equipment. Additionally, data from the stream gaging network are used for multiple purposes, including decision-making during flooding that can affect life and property. Consequently, the USGS may face legal liability should a key station&rsquo;s data not be available or of compromised quality owing to unfamiliar or poorly performing network components. For the aforementioned reasons, as well as the continuity of scientific data, that FTS was determined to be the only vendor capable of meeting this requirement.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Pursuant to FAR 6.305 Availability of the Justification, the justification for other than full and open competition will be made available within 14 days after contract award.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">QUESTIONS AND INQUIRIES:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Questions must be submitted in writing to Lane Jones at lanejones@usgs.gov.</p>

<SUBJECT>Model Use of Innovative MEDLOG Data Management Technologies and Industry Best Practices 
<SOLNBR>MTEC-18-01-MEDLOG
<RESPDATE>120617
<CONTACT>Lisa A. Fisher, Phone 843-760-3356, Fax 843-760-3356, Email lisa.fisher@ati.org
<DESC>The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this announcement for a Request for Project Proposals (RPP) focused on <strong>Model Use of Innovative MEDLOG Data Management Technologies and Industry Best Practices: Architecture, Data Transactions Model and Prototype for a Highly Scalable, Integrated, And Just in Time Defense Medical Logistics Enterprise to support Next Gen Theater/Operational Medicine, Solicitation Number: MTEC-18-01-MEDLOG.</strong>
<p><br />The Defense Medical Logistics Standard System (DMLSS) is currently undergoing a technical refresh activity in which it will move from a client server infrastructure to an open architecture, web based system. This transformation will signal the introduction of the new generation system called LogiCole. While this will take a couple of years to complete, the military would like to look beyond this immediate action and identify emerging technologies that could potentially improve the overall performance of the system to enable higher functionality to Defense Medical Logistics users. Therefore, the objective of this MTEC RPP is to perform an in-depth analysis of current industry/academic best practices, future trends and technical capabilities, and rapidly emerging technologies, such as blockchain, predictive modeling for logistics pre-positioning, data requirements for drone tracking/delivery, 3D printing and other innovative approaches, for evaluation and potential adoption. The end goal is to improve Defense Medical Logistics Information Technology (DMLIT) systems to support medical care to injured and ill warfighters and their families. The Joint medical logistics functional community requires a study of data management tools and methodologies in use within private industry and under development in academia that allows for cutting-edge, highly transactional data compilation, advanced data analytics, and global inventory management. This research effort will expedite the realization of Department of Defense's (DoD's) ability to leverage information technologies and practices thereby significantly advancing the integration of cutting edge technologies with the modernization of Defense Medical Logistics Enterprise Solution (DML-ES). With this research, DML-ES modernization will have added opportunities to integrate higher functionality into the technologies and improved aptitude ultimately lending to DML-ES interaction with Joint Operational Medicine Information Systems (JOMIS) efforts for healthcare and readiness.</p>
<p>The RPP requests a Solution Brief which is a written description of the means and methods that will be used to develop a prototype model for the integration of innovative logistics data management technologies best practices within Defense Medical Logistics Enterprise Solution (DML-ES). The prototype would provide the architecture, a proof-of-concept demonstration, and technical development documents that leverage industry best practices and solutions for integration within the existing DML-ES framework to improve precision by system analysts and end users. Deliverables will include, but are not limited to prototype user interfaces, modified Data and Information Viewpoints (DIV-1, DIV-2, DIV-3), modified All Viewpoints (AV-1), (AV-2), modified DML-ES Capability Viewpoints, modified DML-ES System Viewpoints, and modified DML-ES Operational Viewpoints. This solicitation will follow a 2 phase approach. The expected period of performance for both phases is estimated to be 24 months.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">See the attachment for the details of this RPP.</span></strong></p>
<p>MTEC will host a Proposers Conference tentatively scheduled for the morning of the November 13, 2017 that will be conducted by webinar. There will be a set of briefing slides made available through signature of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) prior to the webinar. After the webinar, there will be a chance to have 15 minute private Q&amp;A sessions with MTEC and the DoD) concerning this RPP. Further instructions and points of contact will be forthcoming to allow you to enroll, receive the briefing, and sign up for a private session.</p>
<p>Responses to this RPP in the form of Solution Briefs are due <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no later than <strong>December 6, 2017</strong>, 12:00pm EDT.</span></p>
<p>All Offerors responding to this opportunity are required to be members of MTEC. To join MTEC, please visit http://mtec-sc.org/how-to-join/</p>

PROVISION FAR 52.212-1 -- INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS, applies to this acquisition.  

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS 

(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made using a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) approach; the Government will award to the lowest priced offeror that is determined technically acceptable.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

(i)	Factor 1: Technical Capability 

(1.)	 The offeror shall submit their technical approach and demonstrated experience/evidence of ability to successfully perform the services.  Submit information on qualified key personnel and equipment that will be used on the projects.  The factor will be rated as "Technically Acceptable" or "Technically Unacceptable."
(2.)	"Technically Acceptable" is defined as the item offered to the Government that meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. 
(3.)	"Technically Unacceptable" is defined as the item offered to the Government that does not meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.


(ii)	Factor 2:  Past Performance

1.	Past performance shall provide adequate information describing the offerorÂ¿s previous experience in Mechanical Mastication/Chipping Services within the past three years from the issuance date of this RFQ. The offeror shall also list all contracts performed in the past three years from issue date of this RFQ that are of the same magnitude and complexity of this project. In addition, the Government may solicit past performance on contracts not listed by the offeror. If an offeror does not have any past performance information to submit as the entity under which the offer is being submitted, then the offeror should submit past performance data identified above under which the offeror's key personnel have worked.  The offeror's quote will be evaluated to determine the extent to which its past performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance.  The evaluation will consider both the relevance and quality of past projects.  The Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).   The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources. The information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination. An Offeror without relevant past performance will receive a neutral rating (i.e., neither technically acceptable nor technically unacceptable).  


Technical and past performance, when combined, are equal to cost or price.  

(b)	 Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c)	Award Process: 

1.	The Government will first evaluate all quotations to ensure the quotation complies with all material aspects of the request for quotation thereby being determined as either "Responsive" or "Non-Responsive." 

2.	 Responsive quotes will then be submitted for Technical Evaluation to determine those that are either "Technically Acceptable" or "Technically Unacceptable."

3.	"Technically Acceptable" quotations will be then ranked according to Price.

4.	The lowest priced offeror who is technically acceptable will receive the award.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

FAR 52.212-3 - OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS 
The offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the Offeror has completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site accessed through http://www.acquisition.gov .

<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>11/14/2017.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Tubing Suction and Connectors. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong><br /><br />These Tubing Suction and Connectors products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Tubing Suction and Connectors in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items, whether they are deemed usage or non-usage by the MTFs.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Tubing Suction and Connectors will be established approximately March 2018 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately April 2018 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Tubing Suction and Connectors. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Tubing Suction and Connectors.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Tubing Suction and Connectors. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $448,878. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Eleven items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 87% ($394,909) of the total volume in sales ($448,878). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<strong><br /><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.</strong><br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures<br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification.<strong> A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.</strong><br /><br />1.	Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number was applied for. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a DAPA number will not be considered for continued participation.<br />2.	Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement.<br />3.

Vendors who do not continue to process application for a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for continued participation. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.<br />5.	<strong>Vendor offered products shall be TAA compliant. End-items offered shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active."</p>
<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>
<p>(1) "Defense items," defined in the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778(j)(4)(A), as defense articles, defense services, and related technical data, and further defined in the ITAR, 22 CFR Part 120.</p>
<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>
<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>
<p>(3) The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701, et seq.);</p>
<p>(4) The Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR Parts 730-774);</p>
<p>(5) The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR Parts 120-130); and</p>
<p>(6) Executive Order 13222, as extended.</p>
<p>(e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>
<p>(c) DoD shall promptly review the Contractor's assessment, and the Procuring Contracting Officer shall provide a written notification to the Contractor including-</p>
<p>(1) A statement as to whether DoD agrees that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract; and</p>
<p>(2)(i) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract and the lack of performance will adversely affect national security, the total amount of the monies collected that should be returned to the Contractor; or</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access.

Description and Statement of Work:
Interacoustics Eclipse EP25 System and associated components to support auditory rehabilitation research activities to be conducted by the VA RR&D National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research, such as a proposed study entitled,  Longitudinal Effects of Antibiotic Treatment on Auditory Physiological and Behavioral Responses in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis. 
Statement of Work
Procurement of:  Interacoustics Eclipse EP25 System and associated components is necessary to support auditory rehabilitation research activities to be conducted by the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research, including a proposed study entitled,  Longitudinal Effects of Antibiotic Treatment on Auditory Physiological and Behavioral Responses in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis.  Dr. Patrick Feeney is the Director/NCRAR, and will serve as the Principal Investigator for this study, though it is anticipated that this system will permit shared use among multiple additional research studies that would benefit from using this equipment.  
The Eclipse EP25 System is a hardware platform used to objectively assess various components of hearing function.  The system records auditory-evoked potentials and the research module is essential for more flexible recording parameters and analyses that are requisite for the proposed research.  An added benefit to this particular system is that it is expandable, and modules can be purchased in the future that enable additional tests, such as otoacoustic emissions and vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials. 
The Eclipse EP25 System is to be used for a multi-site grant proposal for which both sites will be collecting data using the same system, with the identical stimuli.Â  The collaborating site already owns this exact system and associated components.  This procurement will enable both sites to have identical equipment, and collect and combine data from identical systems, which is imperative to the proposed research collaboration.  The Eclipse 25EP System will compare changes in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) waves I and V in Cystic Fibrosis patients undergoing antibiotic treatment.   
 List of items to be purchased:  
Interacoustics Eclipse EP25

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is 70T05018Q9NORD002. The solicitation is issued as a request for quotations (RFQ).</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-94, 2005-95 / 01-19-2017.</p>
<p>(iv) The acquisition is being conducted on an unrestricted basis. The associated NAICS code is 334511 with a small business size standard of 1,250 employees.</p>
<p>(v) Line item number and items, quantities, and units of measure:</p>
<p>00001 Item 42200191 Sample Swabs for the Implant Sciences B220 machine 1,386 cans (100 count each)</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTE: This is a brand name requirement. No substitute/alternate products will be considered for award.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>(vi) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired: Sample Swabs for the Implant Sciences B220</p>
<p>(vii) Deliver to TSA, 9377 West Higgins, Attn: Lino Galassi, Rosemont, IL 60018 within 30 days after receipt of order. FOB point is destination.</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items does not apply to this acquisition. The following evaluation procedures will be utilized:</p>
<p>Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1) Quotes may be removed from consideration for, but not limited to, the following reasons:</p>
<p>&bull; Quotes that are not received timely<br />&bull; Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1<br />&bull; Quotes that fail to submit any required documentation <br />&bull; Quotes that have language inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation</p>
<p>2) Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.</p>
<p>3) The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 3 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 3 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.</p>
<p>If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue (in order by price) until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.</p>
<p>4) USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.</p>
<p>(e) Each Factor will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>Factor 1. Technical Acceptability</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Acceptable - The quoted product is the brand name product specified.<br />Unacceptable - The quoted product is not the brand name product specified</p>
<p>Factor 2. Past Performance</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Acceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort</p>
<p>Note: In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>Note: Quoters are not required or requested to submit past performance references. The Government will use public and Government-restricted sources (e.g. PPIRS) to evaluate past performance.</p>
<p><br />Factor 3. Price</p>
<p>Price will not be rated. Price analysis will be conducted to determine reasonableness.</p>
<p>(x) Quoters are advised to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items with its quote.</p>
<p>(xi) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda to the clause.</p>
<p>(xii) The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The following additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are applicable to the acquisition.</p>

<p>Submittals; <br />It is incumbent upon the offeror to submit sufficient information for the Government to make a determination of your technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance and price. Failure to submit sufficient information for the government to determine your technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance or price may be cause for rejection of your quote.</p>
<p>(1) Technical Acceptability - to be determined technically acceptably offerors shall submit for evaluation, documentation of their capability to provide the specified services in accordance with the project Performance Work Statement, including but not limited to, the capability to provide the services specified, and in accordance with the specified delivery schedule.</p>

<p>The Government's approach to evaluating past performance is to check the references provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance as well as data obtained from other sources available i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The offeror is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating satisfactory past performance rests with the offeror.</p>

The Government may reject any quote that is determined to be Not Fair and Reasonable, unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government estimates, or are unbalanced, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the requirements. All quotes will be evaluated and a determination made of lowest price, from prices presented on the Bidding Schedule, based on the Total of all line items.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p><br />52.246-2 - Inspection of Supplies -- Fixed-Price (Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN:
This QASP has been developed to evaluate contractor performance while implementing this PWS.  It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring each listed objective.  These objectives are summarized into performance objectives that relate directly to mission essential items.  The performance threshold briefly describes the minimum acceptable levels of service required for each objective, which are critical to mission success.
The QASP is based on the premise that the Government desires to maintain a quality standard in the operation of the systems to be serviced under this agreement and to provide the service is the best means of achieving that objective.  The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.  The role of the Government is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved. 
Performance Objective
Performance Threshold
Type of Surveillance 
Remove Snow and Ice.  Ensure paved areas are safe for vehicle and/or pedestrian traffic. Ensure areas have adequate de-icing material for the conditions.
No more than 3 customer complaints per service month.
Monitored by COR
Haul Snow and Ice off campus to prevent accumulation of snow.  Ensure snow is hauled off campus in a safe, timely and efficient manner as required by the PWS.
No more than 2 customer complaints per service month
Monitor by COR thru Periodic Inspections at least Monthly

16.1 SURVEILLANCE:  The Government QA (COR) will evaluate the performance objectives through periodic inspections during each service month.
16.2 STANDARD:  A Notice of Violation (NOV) is not permitted. The Contractor shall perform all work required in a satisfactory manner in accordance with the PWS. The QA shall not consider the services complete until all deficiencies have been corrected.
16.3 PROCEDURES:  The Government QA (COR) will inspect all performance objectives at least monthly to ensure Contractor compliance with PWS and record results of these inspections, noting the date and time of inspection.  If inspection indicates unacceptable performance, notify the Contractor's Quality Control Inspector (QCI) of the deficiencies needing correction.  The Contractor shall be given two hours after notification to correct the unacceptable performance.  The QA may approve additional time if considered appropriate.  If deficiencies are not corrected within the required time, the QA should notify the Contracting Officer for action.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(ii) Examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></p>

All reports of reading and inspections required by the specifications shall be submitted to the COR in writing using a "Condition Found Report (CFR)" form, within 24 hours after the readings and/or inspections are made. <br />Promptness in taking and reporting readings is particularly important for underbody work items such as shaft bearing or rudder bearing clearances.

To speed the contract change progress, the Contractor should include in his/her CFR the following details as a minimum:</p>

This document is a modification to combined synopsis/solicitation 36C26118Q0029 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

 The evaluation of offers received in response to the solicitation will use a tiered or cascading order of precedence.  Tiered evaluation of offers,  also known as  cascading evaluation of offers,  is a procedure used in negotiated acquisitions when market research is inconclusive for justifying limiting competition to small business concerns or sub-categories of small business concerns. The contracting officer  
(1) Solicits offers from both small and other than small business concerns that will be evaluated in the following tier order: 
(a) service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB); 
(b) veteran-owned small business (VOSB); 
(c) all other small business concerns; 
(d) other than small business. 
(2) If an award or a sufficient number of awards cannot be made at the first tier, evaluation of offers will proceed at the next lower tier until an award or a sufficient number of awards can be made. 
 
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit. Interested persons may submit offers, and all eligible offers received prior to 1:00 PM PDT November 6th, 2017 will be considered by the Government. The NAICS code is 339113 and the size standard is 750 Employees. 
This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-89 effective, July 14, 2016.
Products shall be supplied in accordance with the specifications, terms and conditions contained herein. In addition, the following FAR and VAAR clauses will also apply. Thank you.

Alternate system submission: Offerers submitting alternate items must provide technical information sufficient for a lay person to determine acceptability. Information will not be paid for by the government nor returned to the supplying party. The information will be used to determine product acceptability. Lack of sufficient information for our staff to determine product acceptability will result in a negative determination.  Any quote will then be found nonÂ­responsive to the solicitation and the quote will not be considered.

New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured, used/refurbished or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. No product in development shall be considered.

Authorized dealers: Experienced firms only who are authorized dealers will be considered in addition to the original equipment manufacturer. A letter from the manufacturer stating your company is an authorized dealer for the line items must be in possession by the due date and be available for submission, if requested.

FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)
  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price
and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:
  The Government will award to the lowest price, technically acceptable offeror. Brand name or equal. 
  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to the vendor questions listed below.

ALARIS IV PUMPS 36C10G-18-Q-0040
VENDOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Question:  I have a question regarding the Alaris solicitation 36C10G18Q0040. In the solicitation document you reference the following:   The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339112 and the associated size standard is 1000 employees.   In the attached document justification you state  other than full and open , for direct with BD/CareFusion for Alaris products.  BD/Carefusion is a large company greater than 1000 employees.Â  Seems in conflict with original solicitation.

Answer:  You are correct that this is an  other than full and open  solicitation for Alaris brand name only equipment.  In regards to the NAICS we are required to list the applicable NAICS code and size designation on all solicitations, however, this is not a small business set-aside, so large businesses are permitted to submit quotes.



Question:  I saw this posting for Alaris Pumps.  After reading this is an Open Market and not a set aside or a Cascading Solicitation   can you confirm?  We have had several Alaris awards over the past year as an SDVOSB Set aside.

Answer:  Thank you for your interest in the subject requirement.  You are correct in that this requirement is not set-aside for small business; this requirement is for Alaris brand name items only and the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is coded as a large business.  At the time of our market research the OEM indicated to us that they had no authorized distributors for these products.  If that is no longer the case and you are an authorized distributor we welcome your participation in this acquisition.  



Question:  Alaris does have several SDVOSB Authorized Distributors.  In September (last month)   we received an award for Alaris Award for two contracts.  We would like to request that this Solicitation be posted as an SDVSOB Set Aside or a Cascading Approach Solicitation

Answer:  Thank you for your interest in the subject requirement.  You are correct in that this requirement is not set-aside for small business; this requirement is for Alaris brand name items only and the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is coded as a large business.  At the time of our market research the OEM indicated to us that they had no authorized distributors for these products.  As the OEM has stated they don t have authorized distributors the CO has determined that it isn t likely that 2 or more SDVOSB would be able to quote/meet all of the requirements of this solicitation.  If that is no longer the case and you are an authorized distributor we welcome your participation in this acquisition.  


Question:  Is it possible to change this to a cascading solicitation as I know you will receive multiple SDVOSB participation?

Answer:   Market Research indicates that this requirement is not suitable for the cascading or tiered evaluation method as there are no identified SDVOSB, VOSB, or SB manufacturers of the required supplies.
  


Question:  We reviewed the RFP posted on FBO.gov with Solicitation No. 36C10G18Q0040
The excel file attached with the RFP in which part no or description is not mentioned.  So it's our request to please mention part number or description in excel file.
Answer:  The part number and description are listed on Attachment A, Cost and Price Schedule in column B.

<DESC>***NOTICE***
<p>Site visit details have been added to below description. See below. ______________________________________________________________________<br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This RFI is ISSUED for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The requested information is for planning purposes only and does NOT constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect cost or charges will arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this RFI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safe guarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Formal notices will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, http://www.fbo.gov/.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in">DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government is interested in obtaining information concerning a replacement for an existing high-voltage, direct-current power supply for an arc-heated test facility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The power supply shall provide increased capability for a Test and Evaluation facility that uses the power supply connected to an arc heater (one of three that share a common infrastructure) to generate the required test conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government expects that the system will be a fully integrated system consisting of transformer and rectifier equipment that operates in coordination with auxiliary equipment including, but not limited to, appropriate buses, breakers, and health monitoring devices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This equipment must convert 161kV TVA line voltage to DC power from a low power requirement of nominally 5 MW up to 225 MW.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The overarching requirement for the system is that it be configurable to deliver a pre-specified level of current to the arc heater over the duration of a test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE</span></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based upon the operating characteristics and ranges described below, the Government solicits input from industry and others regarding methods for designing, manufacturing, commissioning, operating, and maintaining such a system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government expects, based upon responses, to solicit further input to this RFI and then host an Industry Day, which will prepare the Government to issue a Solicitation (Request For Proposals) to provide the power supply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All respondents that can provide any of the requested information should reply in writing (electronic responses) to the contract specialist, Adam Foret at <a href="mailto:adam.foret.1@us.af.mil">adam.foret.1@us.af.mil</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in">OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Existing</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The existing system is comprised of a tap changing transformer, a set of reactors downstream of the transformer, and an uncontrolled rectifier that converts the AC power to DC power for the arc heater.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tap of the transformer is configured to deliver the required current for a given test.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The start sequence for the arc heater requires rapidly increasing voltage across the electrodes of the heater to initiate an arc that bridges the gap, causing a sudden decrease in the resistance between the electrodes and a drop in voltage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Simultaneous to closing the breaker for the electrical circuit, a quick opening valve is actuated to introduce the test medium (high pressure air) to the heater.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At this point, the current to the heater must be maintained at the desired amperage as the voltage across the heater climbs to compensate for the increasing resistance of the test medium. Upon reaching the desired pressure in the heater, the system sources current at the pre-selected value while passively adjusting the voltage in response to the dynamically changing load resistance of the arc heater.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Representative power levels at which the existing system has operated (Voltage is across the heater, not the output of the rectifier) are:</p>

<DESC>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential manufacturing sources and to determine if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside. This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research. No funds are available to fund the information solicited.
<p>The 421St Supply Chain Management Squadron located at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for the manufacture of the NSN(s) listed below. The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. Qualification requirements exist and can be located in FedBizzOps.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a name="_GoBack"><strong></strong></a><strong>Questions and answer for RFI:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is there a single contractor supporting the current/legacy intranet, or are there multiple contractors supporting the current/legacy intranet? Can you please provide contractor name(s) and contract number(s) for those?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current intranet environments are support by both contractor and government staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Will the work to be performed at Fort Belvoir, VA, or elsewhere? (i.e., contractor site?)</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Certain key positions, such as Business Analysts should be onsite at Ft. Belvoir, however telework and remote work is typically authorized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is it anticipated that this will be a best value opportunity?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does the Government anticipate setting this requirement aside for a small business? Or is this decision contingent on the number of small business responses to the RFI?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A small business set aside will be determined at the time of solicitation, after all market research is complete, currently we have not made a set aside decision and is partially contingent upon RFI responses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Can you provide an anticipated timeframe for when an associated RFP is to be released?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Could be late 2018/early 2019.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you please clarify whether you are looking only for an off the shelf solution with little labor, as the NAICS code implies, or a full service solution.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The government anticipates labor being necessary for analysis work, configuration, migration and implementation whether a COTS product is recommended or a customized full service solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will the contractor be required to hold a security clearance to complete this work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A: SECURITY REQUIREMENTS for this effort will be as follows: All Contractor employees must meet the security criteria to occupy national security sensitive position as required by DoD 5200.2M, DoD Personnel Security Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All contractors assigned work under this under this contract must be a U.S. citizen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DCAA security office will coordinate with the Contractor Facility Security Officer or contractor personnel to ensure compliance with DoD 5200.2M for occupancy of a national security sensitive position. The contractor Facility Security Officer may submit a Visit Request to DCAA HQ Security using JPAS SMO Code B9000 for contractor personnel that already meet the requirements of a national security sensitive positon.</p>

<DESC>SUMMARY:
<p>The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), NIH, invites you to submit a proposal in response to RFP No. N01TR-18-2006, titled "Reagent Generation for Bioanalytical Method Development for Biologics."</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT AND TYPE OF SERVICE</p>
<p>The Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI) at National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducts translational research in the area of human therapeutics development.<br /><br />The objective of this contract is to support the DPI drug development programs by generating reagents (e.g. polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies) that will be used in bioanalytical assay development to quantify concentrations of novel biologics and anti-drug antibodies(ADA) in biological samples (e.g. plasma, serum and tissue homogenate) collected from preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies, as well as human pharmacokinetic studies in clinical trials.<br /><br />Under this contract, novel biologics include but are not limited to the following:  mAbs, recombinant human proteins, Fc-fusion proteins, bio-functional proteins, PEGylated or other engineered peptides, protein fragments, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), engineered human genes and carriers, in plasma/serum, tissue homogenates, and CSF.<br /><br />This RFP is a follow-up solicitation to NCATS RFP No. N01TR-17-2004, "CRO Support for NCATS Bioanalytical Method Development for Biologics," that was issued on January 26, 2017. In that RFP, the Statement of Work was divided into four technical areas:  Technical Area 1:  Reagent Generation; Technical Area 2:  Bioanalytical Method Development for Novel Biologic Drugs; Technical Area 3:  Bioanalysis of Novel Biologic Drugs in Biologic Matrices; and Technical Area 4:  Determination of Anti-Drug Neutralizing Antibodies.  To qualify for award, organizations had to demonstrate capabilities in at least one technical area.  <br /><br />NCATS received no responses in Technical Area 1, Reagent Generation. Therefore, it is issuing a new RFP soliciting responses to the reagent generation requirement.<br /><br />NCATS anticipates making a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity-type award with individually negotiated cost reimbursement or fixed price task orders over a five-year ordering period. The guaranteed minimum for the awardee will be $5,000, and the program maximum is $696,028.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of DPI and this planned project is to bring new drugs to market.  To this end, the Government has issued a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) to deviate from the Federal Acquisition Regulation clauses at 52.227-11 Patent Rights and 52.227-14 Rights in Data.  The deviated language enables DPI contributors to retain control of their intellectual property, and will be included in the RFP and incorporated in any resultant contract.  Prospective Offerors are advised that agreement to the terms of these FAR clauses deviations will be a condition for contract award.</p>
<p>This is a new requirement; therefore, no incumbent information is provided. The Government will select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in accordance with the basis of award included in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The anticipated award date for this action is around July 1, 2018.</p>
<p>ABOUT DPI AND NCATS</p>
<p>The Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI) at National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) conducts translational research in the area of human therapeutics development and aims to move small molecule and biologic drug candidates forward in the drug development pipeline to predetermined milestones, at which point DPI will hand off the drug candidate to external partner(s) to bring the novel therapy to patients.</p>
<p>In addition to developing new candidate drugs, DPI seeks to advance the entire field of drug discovery and development by encouraging scientific and technological innovations aimed at improving success rates in the crucial pre-clinical stage of drug development. DPI's model is to operate as a full range small molecule and biologics drug development organization, moving drug candidates through each phase of the pre-clinical drug development process until an IND is filed with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For certain drug development programs, DPI will support its candidate's development up to human Phase IIB studies if such support will achieve DPI's mission.</p>
<p>DPI conducts drug development as collaborations through programs such as the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) and the Bridging Interventional Development Gaps (BrIDGs) programs. DPI drug development programs originate from academia, industry, non-profit foundations, or internally from NCATS and other NIH institutes, and its R&amp;D operational strategy is to combine the capabilities of DPI in-house staff and DPI partners, who may be the drug originators. Each drug program operates in a multi-disciplinary, multi-partnership matrix team environment, and a DPI program officer (PO) is responsible for the overall planning, execution, and reporting of the program.</p>
<p>Contract research organizations (CROs) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) provide DPI with manufacturing, pharmacology, toxicology, regulatory, and clinical operations services to assist with drug development.  Planning and execution of each individual drug development program includes identification of scientific areas best suited for utilization of CROs and CMOs to conduct some or all parts of a given drug development program.</p>

<p><strong>All information received shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Please do not submit any proprietary or classified information.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) is one of the significant operational arms of NOAA.  Through its headquarters office in Silver Spring, MD and Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, FL, OMAO operates, maintains and manages the aircraft used by NOAA programs to collect the critical airborne environmental observations essential to meeting NOAA's prioritized airborne requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br />The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about the capability and availability of purchasing one (1) multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft, with necessary modifications, to replace NOAA/AOC's Gulfstream Turbo Commander, AC695A aircraft, with the option to purchase a second multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft to support NOAA/OMAO's national mission.  The purchased aircraft(s) will be based and modeled after NOAA's King Air 350CER (serial number FM21) for safety and standardization.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The aircraft of the NOAA/AOC are flown in support of NOAA's mission to promote global environmental assessment, prediction and stewardship of the Earth's environment.  NOAA's aircraft operate throughout the United States and around the world over open oceans, mountains, coastal wetlands, and Arctic pack ice.  These versatile aircraft provide scientists with airborne platforms necessary to collect the environmental and geographic data essential to their research.</p>
<p>The AOC provides capable, mission-ready aircraft and professional crews to the scientific community wherever and whenever they are required. Whether studying global climate change or acid rain, assessing marine mammal populations, surveying coastal erosion, investigating oil spills, or improving hurricane prediction models, the AOC flight crews continue to operate in some of the world's most demanding flight regimes.</p>
<p>The AOC operates and maintains a Gulfstream Turbo Commander (AC695A, serial number 96089), a highly modified twin turboprop aircraft, supporting NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS).  As one of five NOAA Line Offices, NWS works to provide weather, water, and climate data, forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property and enchantment of the national economy.  Manufactured in 1984, the airframe is over 30 years old and due to aging costs, standardization issues, and loss of mission readiness, OMAO is seeking to replace this aircraft.</p>
<p>The AOC also operates and maintains a Hawker-Beechcraft King Air 350CER (B300C, serial number FM21), another highly modified twin-turboprop aircraft that was acquired in 2007 (WC133M07CN0231), supporting NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS).  As one of five NOAA Line Offices, NOS works to observe, understand, and manage our Nation's coastal and marine resources. NOS measures and predicts coastal and ocean phenomena, protects large areas of the oceans, works to ensure safe navigation, and provides tools and information to protect and restore coastal and marine resources.   NOAA's requirements have grown over the past ten (10) years and a single aviation platform cannot support all the flight hours that NOS requests every year.  Additionally, this aircraft serves as a single point of failure for the collection of rapid response damage assessment following storms that impact the United States and its territories and the requirement for a backup aircraft exists for the Nation.  For these reasons, OMAO is seeking to expand its fleet of aircraft.</p>
<p>AOC is replacing the Turbo Commander with a multi-purpose twin-engine turbo prop aircraft(s) capable of efficiently flying the profiles required by NWS and the other line offices in NOAA.   AOC is also contemplating expanding its fleet and capabilities by acquiring an additional King Air 350.<br />The prospective aircraft(s) will be based and modeled after NOAA's existing King Air 350CER, serial number FM21, for safety and standardization.  This Sources Sought / RFI is issued to gage industry interest as well as aircraft availability for this requirement.</p>

<p>3. Project Description: CENWP requires the supply of two (2) complete sets of access platforms needed for in situ access to the turbine runners at The Dalles Dam, Oregon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dalles_Dam .</p>
<p>Each set of access platforms consists of a Blade Scaffold which rests on top of the blades, a main Turbine Maintenance Platform (TMP) attached to the runner or the discharge ring, and a Draft Tube Access Platform (DTP) attached to the draft tube access door. The two platform sets are not identical because they are for two different families of turbine runners for which the draft tube diameter varies by at least a foot. The majority of all the components for the platforms are made from aluminum according to the requirements of the government's detailed contract drawings. Fabricators must demonstrate experience and certifications needed to perform complicated fabrications and weld aluminum according to AWS D1.2 Structural Aluminum Welding. The Blade Scaffolding consists of six commercially available painters stages connected together by custom welded aluminum connector plates to form a ring plus an additional painters stage used to cross from the wicket gates to the blade scaffold ring. The TMP consists of six truss members connected by structural aluminum tubes using pinned assembly connections to form the main structural sub-assembly. Thirty aluminum decking panels rest on the TMP sub-assembly forming the working surface. The DTP consists of an aluminum platform with guardrails attached to the draft tube door with an access ladder up to the TMP above. All platform elements will be fabricated according to the government's detailed design per the specification requirements and the requirements of AWS D1.2 Structural Aluminum Welding. The contract drawing package is anticipated to consist of approximately 30 drawings for the required platforms.</p>

<DESC>The DOD Cloud RFI is amended in response to an RFI inquiry:<br /><br />The  DoD Enterprise Cloud Acquisition is a new initiative as indicated in the  attached memorandum from the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Please see  the attached memorandum for details. 	<br /><br /><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) Cloud Executive Steering Group (CESG) is seeking information related to the initiative recently established by Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan to accelerate enterprise cloud adoption.  DoD is seeking targeted industry input on how to best approach and structure the planned solicitation to acquire a modern enterprise cloud services solution that can support unclassified, secret, and top secret information in CONUS and OCONUS environments.</p>
<p>This effort is being done in an aggressive, yet rigorous manner to ensure the Department realizes the operational advantages of cloud infrastructure and platform services as quickly as possible.  The Department recognizes the value of technical voices from industry and encourages those voices to be at the forefront in responding to this Request for Information (RFI).</p>
<p>Cloud Acquisition Considerations</p>
<p>Below are some considerations to help industry best respond to this RFI:</p>
<p>1.	This is an acquisition for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).  This requirement does not include Software as a Service (SaaS).  <br />2.	The tactical edge and delivering services to the warfighter matter.  The required cloud services must extend from the homefront to the tactical edge, to include austere and connectivity/communication deprived environments, and be able to support closed loop networks supporting warfighting operations.  <br />3.	This acquisition will require services in CONUS and OCONUS locations at all classification levels.<br />4.	DoD is seeking technical parity with commercial cloud, even if private or hybrid cloud services are part of the final solution.  <br />5.	DoD is seeking to capitalize and rely on the services and expertise of the cloud provider(s) to the greatest extent possible to include management of facilities and infrastructure at higher classification levels.<br />6.	DoD is prepared to pursue the revision of existing policies and federal regulations remove barriers to success.  Revisions are not guaranteed and will require the balancing of many factors, including security and reliability.<br />7.	DoD is seeking firm-fixed (i.e., catalogue) prices for all services under this indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract.  <br />8.	DoD is considering in-depth technical analysis of the current environment, cloud migration support, change management, and training services to be within scope of this contract.<br />9.	A contract award is planned for fiscal year 2018.</p>
<p>Questions for RFI Respondents</p>
<p>Given the considerations set forth above, DoD is seeking targeted feedback from potential cloud providers and other vendors with relevant information for the following questions broken out by subject area.  Partial responses are acceptable although complete responses to all questions are preferred understanding that some questions may be inapplicable to your company depending on the kinds of offerings you provide.</p>
<p>I.  Lessons Learned<br />1.	For large customers with a worldwide presence, what kind of personnel resources internal to the customer do you recommend be available to facilitate and support workload migrations?  What kind of enterprise program office structure and governance oversight would you recommend based on your experience? <br />2.	What are the main factors that contribute to system migration failure from your experience?  How can those risks be mitigated? <br />3.	What kind of customer processes or behaviors have you found essential to enable the optimization of using cloud infrastructure?<br />4.	What internal support structures and resources would you recommend for an organization that wishes to capitalize on the sharing of data across the cloud in order to support data-driven decision making and big data analysis?<br />5.	In your experience, what are the key factors to securing information in an enterprise cloud infrastructure? What are the primary risks to mitigate in this environment?</p>
<p>II.  Pricing and Services<br />1.	Please describe and provide information about your typical pricing structure for IaaS and/or PaaS.  <br />a.	What kind of fixed price pricing structure would you recommend DoD use for this solicitation?  What kind of CLIN structure would you recommend?  Please provide an example or commercial pricing list/structure as part of your response.  DoD is interested in a utility-based model based on usage paid in arrears.<br />2.	Please describe in detail the services that comprise your IaaS, PaaS, and/or other relevant offerings. Explain and diagram the infrastructure architecture in detail.  Additionally:<br />a.	If you provide cloud migration support as part of your IaaS/PaaS offerings, please describe in detail the scope of those services, how many employees you have that provide this service (distinguishing between direct employees and subcontractors), and where additional services from another vendor may be required to successfully migrate a system workload.<br />i.	Explain how you would recommend cloud migration support be provided in OCONUS garrison environments.<br />b.	Please notate and explain any services that are available to your private sector customers, but are not currently available to the Federal government, and explain why.<br />c.	Please describe to what degree your PaaS offerings are able to run on other provider's infrastructure.  In answering this question, identify which offerings are vendor agnostic for infrastructure and also identify which offerings are limited to certain infrastructure providers.  <br />i.	For cloud service providers that support third party PaaS offerings, describe what kind of pricing and billing structures are available.  Describe how your third party marketplace works and explain whether the third party offerings are typically ordered from the cloud service provider directly or from the third party provider.  Describe how clients are able to direct which third party offerings to incorporate into the marketplace.<br />d.	Please describe how your IaaS/PaaS offerings provide for the security of information, including threat detection, mitigation, and containment.<br />e.	Please describe your failover and data replication architecture and service offerings. How would you handle a requirement for resiliency/reliability for a solution at the tactical edge or a hybrid commercial/on-premise solution?<br />f.	How do your offerings provide for sharing of data across network boundaries, including up classification levels and outside of your IaaS/PaaS services (across other cloud provider's environments)?<br />3.	What information or attributes are required for you to accurately provide pricing information on a fixed-price basis for worldwide DoD IaaS/PaaS at all classification levels?  <br />4.	Do you have established discount methodologies, e.g., discount percentages based on reserving virtual instances?  If so, please describe.</p>
<p>III. Tactical Edge<br />1.	Please describe if and how you could provide IaaS/PaaS in austere and connectivity/communication deprived environments.  Explain and diagram the infrastructure architecture in detail, including the use of ruggedized, portable equipment that could be forward deployed and moved within hours of notice.<br />a.	If you have existing customers using such services, please describe and provide point of contact information, if possible.<br />2.	Please describe if and how you could extend IaaS/PaaS into a closed loop network where contractors may not be permitted to manage the facilities.<br />3.	Please describe your hybrid commercial and/or on-premise solution and architecture.  How would you handle an installation at the edge of connectivity, including service initiation and eventual syncing back to installations in garrison?</p>
<p>IV.  Existing Cloud Presence<br />1.	Please describe your current cloud presence in the Federal government for workloads that are classified at Secret or above, if any.  For instance, which agency, describe the technology solution, explain if the cloud services are limited to a specific geographic region, explain who maintains the facility and computing infrastructure, etc.  Do not provide any classified information in this response.<br />2.	Please describe your current on premise private cloud presence in the Federal government, if any.  For instance, which agency, describe the technology solution, describe any limitations in achieving technical parity with commercial cloud, identify the classification level, explain who maintains the facility and computing infrastructure, etc.  Do not provide any classified information in this response.<br />3.	Please describe at least one example of a large commercial customer with worldwide presence that has migrated to your infrastructure and platform services and provide point of contact information, if possible.</p>
<p>V.  Policy and Regulatory Barriers<br />1.	Please identify any policies or federal regulations that are barriers to success, explain why those policies or regulations are barriers, and propose revisions or an alternative that still achieves the underlying policy or regulatory objective.  Specific suggestions with proposed language revisions are preferred rather than more generalized comments.</p>
<p>Instructions for Submission</p>
<p>RFI respondents are encouraged to provide responses to the questions above.  Responses may inform the future enterprise cloud solicitation.  The CESG requests that responses to the RFI be submitted by 17 November 2017 by 1400 Eastern Time.  All submissions must be submitted via email to dod-cloud-responses@dds.mil in a searchable format (e.g., not scanned).  No verbal responses will be accepted.</p>

All submissions will be protected from disclosure outside of the DoD to the maximum extent possible under Federal laws.</p>
<p>Only unclassified responses will be accepted.  Do not submit classified information.</p>
<p>In addition, RFI respondents should be aware that the CESG may utilize contractor support personnel from the below listed companies (under existing contracts) to review responses submitted.  These companies and individual employees are bound contractually by Organizational Conflict of Interest and non-disclosure clauses with respect to proprietary information, and they will take all reasonable action necessary to preclude unauthorized use or disclosure of an RFI respondent's proprietary data.</p>
<p>By submitting an RFI response, the respondent's company is agreeing to the disclosure of its RFI response to the following support contractors.  If permission is not granted, the RFI response must clearly state that permission is denied.  <br />&bull;	Suntiva<br />&bull;	The MITRE Corporation<br />&bull;	Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA)</p>
<p>This RFI is not a solicitation.  This RFI is for planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a solicitation or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, DoD is not seeking proposals at this time, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.  Participation is not mandatory or required; participation or response to this RFI is not a prerequisite for any future procurement activities.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the instructions for submission, email your questions to dod-cloud-responses@dds.mil with the word "Question" in the subject line.</p>

The required tool boxes with tools have been previously designed and purchased by the NAVAIR Lakehurst tool control program at the squadron level from Snap-On/IDSC HOLDINGS LLC. The tool boxes are designed for specific maintenance tasks in which training is conducted utilizing these exact tools and manuals for the repairs that have been written to include these tools. In order to ensure that all servicemen are trained on servicing the aircrafts/equipments and can perform their designated tasked quickly, efficiently and no matter their location, tools are the same from one squadron to the next.
