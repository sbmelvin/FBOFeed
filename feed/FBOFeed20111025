<DESC><strong>C-5 Core Mission Computer/Weather Radar Replacement Program</strong>: The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), Mobility Directorate C-5 Division (ASC/WLSK) intends to award a sole source contract to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics for the design, development, integration, production, installation, test, verification and validation of a Core Mission Computer (CMC) (replacement for the existing C-5 Versatile Integrated Avionics (VIA) and Avionics Interface Unit (AIU) architecture) and Weather Radar (WX Radar) for the C-5M aircraft (defined as C-5 aircraft which has been modified by both the Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) and the Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP)) under Request for Proposal (RFP) FA8625-12-R-6596, henceforth referred to as the CMC/Wx Radar Replacement Program. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." This requirement will not be set-aside for small business and will be covered under NAICS code 336411. An Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is anticipated to be awarded in January 2013 to design and develop the software (as a minimum) for the integration of the contractor selected commercial-off-the shelf CMC and Wx Radar that best meets the government's attached minimum requirements to install onto 3 each C-5M aircraft. The EMD contract will also include developmental testing and evaluation (DT&amp;E); formal qualification testing (FQT); assembly and checkout; training; identification and procurement of peculiar support equipment; spares to support all testing (DT&amp;E and Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) and initial spares; technical publications and technical orders (TOs) (to include Level 3 drawings and manuals (flight, maintenance, depot repair, support equipment and commodity)); modification of 1 each Weapon Systems Trainer (WST) and&nbsp;Aircraft Maintenance System Trainer (AMST); maintenance support; TO validation and verification per TO 00-05-3; re-procurement data; technical data and unlimited data rights/license agreement for all new hardware and software, as well as any modified hardware and software, comprising the selected CMC/Wx Radar architecture in order to provide for organic Government support and depot-level of repair. Estimated period of performance is FY13 through FY15. Since the government plans to issue a sole source solicitation, FA8625-12-R-6596, an additional synopsis will not be issued. The approximate date for issuance of the solicitation is March 2012 with a response date of June 2012.
<p>During FY14 the government will solicit and award a contract for the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase for the CMC/Wx Radar Replacement Program production kits and installation of those kits onto the maximum quantity of 7 each C-5M aircraft. This contract will require accomplishing kit proofing on the first production representative kit; verification, validation and delivery of the installation Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs) on the first LRIP aircraft which would be required by another potential source to bid on and/or accomplish the Fiscal Year (FY) 16 through FY18 installations. Note: A decision will be made by the government in FY14 about whether to accomplish installation of future lots organically or via a competitively awarded contract. The LRIP contract will also include the modification of 4 each WSTs for aircrew and the procurement of peculiar support equipment (PSE); sufficient spares to support the Main Operating Bases (MOBs), Forward Servicing Locations (FSLs), Readiness Spares Packages (RSPs), and peculiar support equipment; and interim contractor support (ICS) for all modified aircraft delivered under EMD and LRIP (maximum 10 total) until the government establishes an organic depot or awards a contractor logistics support (CLS) contract. The data procured and delivered under EMD will be updated during LRIP. Estimated date of award of the LRIP phase is during FY14 with period of performance through FY15.</p>
<p>In FY15 the government will solicit and award either a separate contract or modify the LRIP contract for a maximum quantity of 42 production CMC/Wx Radar Replacement Program Kits not to exceed procurement over 3 lots during the period of FY15 through FY17. This contract will also include procurement of: spares in support of MOBs, FSLs, and RSPs; and peculiar support equipment.</p>
<p>The government does not own nor have access to all of the specifications, standards, and data needed for the design, development, integration, production, installation, test, verification and validation of a Core Mission Computer (CMC) and Weather Radar (WX Radar) for the C-5M aircraft. LMA owns or has access to all the data needed to integrate the CMC/Wx Radar Replacement Program onto the C-5M aircraft. Another source would also require knowledge of or access to LMA proprietary internal specifications and standards as it relates to the legacy C-5 aircraft and C-5 AMP and RERP modernization programs. If you believe your company is a potential source for the design, development, integration, production and installation of the contractor selected CMC and Wx Radar that best meets the attached minimum requirements, then the following criteria are hereby established and all of these criteria are required to be met before the estimated release date of the Request for Proposal on or before March 2012.</p>
<p>a. Potential source shall be a manufacturer or modification contractor of a wide body cargo military or commercial aircraft in the high gross weight category (minimum 500,000 pounds or greater).</p>
<p>b. Have access to or possess C-5 source data to include C-5 AMP and C-5 RERP. As stated above the United States Air Force does not possess this information.</p>
<p>c. Have access to modification facilities capable of accommodating the modification and support prototype aircraft flight-testing and have partnering flexibility with Government depots.</p>
<p>d. Security Clearance for both safeguarding and facility at the Secret level.</p>
<p>e. History of software and hardware design and development for integration of same or similar CMC and Wx Radar with military aircraft.</p>
<p>Those companies interested in being considered supplying only the CMC and/or Wx Radar needs to contact Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, Marietta GA.</p>
<p>Sources responding to this synopsis are required to submit their statement of technical capability, not to exceed 15 pages addressing these criteria to ASC/WLSK, Attn: Ms. Anna Nereng, 2275 D Street, Bldg 16, Room 127, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7222, by facsimile at <br />(937) 656-9672, or E-mail at Anna.Nereng@wapafb.af.mil no later than 5:00 PM EST on 10 November 2011.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command, and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to invite bids for the provision of an integrated suite of Logistics Funactional Serivces (LOG FS).
<p>The&nbsp;purpose of the LOG FS project is to&nbsp;procure the engineering services, hardware, and software required to complement the Bi-SC AIS Core Services with an integrated suite of Logistic Functional Serivces (LOG FS). The latter will replace all the NATO logistics systems currently in operationsl use and will facilitate the work of logistics staffs within NATO. It shall provide the capabilities required to enable NATO commanders to manage NATO logistics and to coordinate the logistics support provided by member nations by consolidating existing logistics systems, creating an integrated logistics system, and providing the required logistics services that are not yet delivered by the existing assets.</p>
<p>NC3A was authorized by the Investment Committee to implement&nbsp;International Competitive Bidding (ICB), which requires that a potential bidder be nominated to the bidders list by its NATO-member government.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce will consider eligible for nomination to the bidders list only those U.S. firms that have 1) been pre-approved for participation in NATO ICB - see Bidding Procedure, below - and that have 2) been issued a DOD facility security clearance at the level of SECRET or higher. In addition, contractor personnel working on NATO sites will be required to hold individual security clearances at the level of NATO SECRET. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NC3A the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>Bids received in response to the Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be evaluated through a best value approach, and the successful bid pursuant to the IFB will be that bid that is deemed to offer the best value for the money in accordance with predefined bid evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the services and deliverables included within the basic scope of the intended contract is &euro;31,999,000. The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-13330-LOG-FS. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>NC3A plans to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>Please note that the IFB will contain an exclusion provision concerning the BI-SC AIS Program Management and Integaration Capability (PMIC) contract.</p>
<p>Please scroll down the following NC3A webpage for more information on IFB-CO-13330-LOG-FS: https://industry.nc3a.nato.int/suppliers/Pages/bb.aspx<br />BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States.<br />U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:<br />http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO-member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request a DOE (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed one-time NATO ICB application) no later than 05 December 2011</p>
<p>- Formal IFB planned to be issued in June 2012</p>
<p>- Bid Closing in September 2012</p>
<p>- Contract Award in July 2013</p>

 The Government will not reimburse costs associated with creating an interest or capability statement.  The applicable NAICS code is 813290.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) in support of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to solicit on a non-competitive basis with Information Tool Designers, Inc., (ITD), to support a previously developed government-owned airborne network security simulator to develop an ANSS scenario and experiment for key airborne network security technologies (e.g. software data loading or EFB and Gatelink) with the goal of providing minimum recommendations (e.g., security checklists). The ANSS scenario and experiment shall include a use case, functional description, and architecture. The Volpe Center also requires the contractor to review and provide comments to ensure technical completeness and accuracy of the ANSS Pratt and Whitney Flight Acquisition, Storage, and Transmission (FAST) System Penetration Test Report being developed by the UK Center for Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI). The contractor shall also support teleconferences with Thales Inc (Irvine, CA) and the Volpe Center regarding Thales In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) ANSS Penetration Testing and this activity shall require a trip to Thales. The contractor shall support two teleconferences to discuss agenda items, such as: technical discussions with Thales regarding safety and security requirements for the IFE system, possible future CSET on the IFE system, operational security scenarios for ANSS testing, and IFE security control requirements. The purpose of the Thales trip will be to participate in a Thales demonstration of the IFE system and continue follow-up discussions from the prior two teleconferences (no preparation for the trip will be required by the Contractor). In addition, the Volpe Center is supporting the FAA in developing a Draft Aircraft Security Catalog/Airborne Network Security Guidance that is consistent with the DHS CSET tool. The Contractor shall develop the Guidance Document that instructs FAA certifiers on minimum level of security controls for specific types of airborne network components and FAA plans to develop an FAA Advisory Circular in 2011/2012 based on this guidance.
<p>The Contractor shall provide research and prepare a report that will be used for input for the development of cyber-security recommended practices to be incorporated in the Security Guidance Document that can be referenced from regulations, standards, and guidance. Contractor support shall include: meeting coordination with Volpe and FAA, and participation, agenda development, briefing development, coordination with document authors, content development/review, and bi-weekly teleconferences. The following items are the 3 major sections of the document that the Contractor shall provide input on:<br />&bull; General Guidance for the Aircraft Certification Offices (ACOs) - High-level document referencing checklist tools to aid in this determination, templates for special conditions/issue papers and security plans<br />&bull; Supplementary Material - Issue Paper/Special Conditions templates<br />&bull; Recommended Best Practices - Minimum security baseline recommendations for securing standard Aircraft Components and archetypes (e.g. electronic flight bags (EFBs), Gatelink, 3gcellular, field loadable software, user modifiable software, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) avionics devices, integrated modular avionics (IMAs), internal/external connectivity, and wireless servers/routers) and the Contractor shall attend an automotive workshop with pertinent public sector and private sector automotive and aviation industry experts to perform a sample risk assessment of automobile control system applications. The Contractor shall develop high-level use case and risk assessment that can be used as a template to perform a future in-depth risk assessment. The contractor shall develop a preliminary Automotive Systems Characteristic Report which will be a key element of the overall assessment. The contractor shall use the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf</a> &nbsp;as guidance.</p>
<p>Travel will be required to the following locations: Washington DC; Seattle, WA, and Irvine, CA.</p>
<p>A Request for Quote (RFQ) issuance will be on or about November 7, 2011.

Vaccine storage design shall maintain the "cold chain" as excess heat or cold will reduce the vaccine's potency, increasing the risk that recipients will not be protected against vaccine preventable diseases. The design shall optimize the transport of pandemic flu and other emergency stock within the building and access to the building. The vaccine storage design shall incorporate security features with PIV Card Reader access and monitoring to provide for secure storage; and, a zoned fire protection and monitoring system designed to minimize damage to stock and equipment in the event of a fire or false alarm. The design shall meet VA HVAC design requirements for Pharmacy Storage Space (Central Warehouse). 

The sterile storage shall be a secure, environmentally controlled area providing temperature and humidity control, HEPA filtration, a minimum of four (4) air changes an hour, and a positive air flow pressure in relation to adjacent areas meeting VA HVAC dedicated air handling equipment requirements for Clean/Sterile Storage.

The project will also address functional space deficiencies in the operations of Supply, Processing, and Distribution and Logistics. Therefore the project will require analysis of these functions to reconfigure the space for optimal processing and storage of equipment and supplies. These services will be part of space planning in the schematic phase of the project. Reconfiguration of the loading dock at Building 17 is anticipated as part of the reconfiguration of workflow. Also, the consultant will explore the inclusion of a limited Prep, Assembly, and Sterilization room. The consultant will aid the VA in analysis of various rooms and functions for inclusion in the renovated space.

For Building 12 the consultant will include design for UFAS compliance for building entries and toilets along with other aspects of accessible design. Replacement of deteriorated mechanical and plumbing system piping is to be included along with repair of the roof. Consultant will be designing for energy efficiency so replacement of lighting and inclusion of building insulation is anticipated as part of the services. The building will have a geothermal system functional prior to design start of this project. The consultant will be expected to incorporate this system into the design of this project. Project should include upgrade of the heating and cooling system to meet current requirements especially pertaining to exhaust and outside air.
The 100% complete design package is required no later than 180 calendar days from Notice to Proceed.  The construction cost range is between $2 and $5 million. 

The consultant shall provide testing and design services for mitigation of asbestos containing materials for the areas involved in the renovation. This will also include mitigation of asbestos containing materials in the crawl space of Building 12.   

The area of consideration is limited to a 250 mile radius of the VA Medical Center, Lexington, KY.  The NAICS code is 541310 and the small business size standard is $4.5 million.  This procurement is 100% set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).

<DESC>STATE HEALTH POLICY DATA BASE (SHPD)
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: <br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) the classification/ type of small business (e.g., whether they are small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, HubZone small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small business, economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) or women-owned small business (WOSB)) and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. Teaming and partnering arrangements among small businesses is encouraged.</p>
<p>Background. The NIH Common Fund was enacted into law by Congress through the 2006 NIH Reform Act to support cross-cutting, trans-NIH programs that require participation by NIH Institutes/Centers or would otherwise benefit from strategic planning and coordination. In October 2010 the NIH Common Fund launched Health Economics Initiative to address the evolving needs of the health care sector for economic research.</p>
<p>One of the goals of the Program is to foster the collection/compilation of data that will be most useful for policy relevant empirical scientific research (www.commonfund.nih.gov/healtheconomics). The implementation of health care reform poses numerous challenges and will need to examine the innovation in State health policy statutes concerning health insurance market regulations, the organization of health care services and approaches of controlling costs. One of the major challenges in health policy relevant economics research is to interpret the economic and clinical incentives structure inherent in State statutes which can be converted into statistically analyzable variables of raw data files. The NIH now intends to develop a State Health Policy Database (SHPD) to address this challenge. Further information about the purpose of the project can be obtained from the NIH Common Fund Health Economics Initiative Request for Information to Solicit Input on the Feasibility, Scope and Design of a State Health Policy Database which was issued on June 29, 2011 (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-RM-11-019.html)</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives.<br />NIMH is seeking information on all small businesses capable of providing potential contract services for a project entitled: "Development of State Health Policy Database (SHPD) to Advance Health Economics Research on Health Care Reform". <br />The purpose of this initiative is to develop a research tool that will document state-level policies in a manner that facilitates valid comparisons across states and over time. Insurance regulation, Medicaid policy, financing public health services, and, many reproductive health policies are all under state jurisdiction. Health care reform will add two major activities for states: 1) the establishment of state health insurance exchanges and 2) the Medicaid extension - both of them are aimed at reducing the number of uninsured.<br />Currently no State Health Policy Database (SHPD) exists which can be easily used by academic researchers to assess the comparative differences in States' policies over time and the potential impact of health care reform. Different public and private organizations have state policy level information from their specific perspectives, but there is no one integrated database for health policy research.</p>
<p>Project requirements.</p>
<p>The SHPD is envisioned as a core, multivariate, raw data set with carefully selected numerical or nominal variables on prioritized health policy domains which can be used for statistical/econometric analysis by computer software.</p>
<p>Interested small businesses must demonstrate they currently have the necessary expertise, equipment and capacity in place to develop and manage a State Health Policy Database (SHPD) for research purposes, over a 5-year period (including potential updates).</p>
<p>The SHPD will be populated with CY 2010 data and available for release as a public use data set on or about September 2014. Potential updates of the datasets are scheduled for CY12, 14, and 16, depending upon the exercise of contract options. Sources will be required to develop a website to access the SHPD. Data sets on State tobacco control policies developed and sponsored by various organizations can serve as potential examples. <br /><br />Interested small businesses must also demonstrate they have the capability and a reasonable plan to provide for updates of the SHPD beyond the base year CY2010 data (i.e., updates for CY12, 14, and 16).</p>
<p>Development of the SHPD with CY2010 data requires the following skills, capabilities and capacities of any small business organizations:</p>
<p>1. Knowledge, experience and advanced training in health policy relevant research, specifically:<br />a. Knowledge and expertise in economic empirical research and econometric analysis<br />b. Legal knowledge of state health policy statutes relevant to current health care reform initiatives and ability to analyze the incentive structure of these statues<br />c. Knowledge and expertise to identify and prioritize the key policy and research questions in this area; sources will be required to convene and manage a one-day expert Scientific Panel meeting and to summarize its recommendations in this regard</p>
<p>2. Knowledge of and ability to access existing publicly available data sets and select most relevant variables for compiling the SHPD data set<br /><br />a. Knowledge of and ability to access existing CY2010 multistate health policy databases (e.g. Kaiser Family Foundation database, Urban Institute Database, <br />COMPARE microsimulation model developed by RAND, federally collected and maintained databases by CDC and NLM and other organizations, like National Academy of State Health Policy, etc.)<br />b. Ability to abstract needed data from above data bases and include them in the SHPD<br />c. Ability to prioritize what variables will be included in the SHPD and what other variables will be linkable only to the SHPD</p>
<p>3. Advanced information technology expertise<br />a. IT expertise including research database design and documentation<br />b. User friendly simple website design that will be incorporated into the National Library of Medicine health services research database<br />c. Basic knowledge of computer software for statistical/econometric analysis</p>
<p>4. Data management capabilities<br />5. Project management<br />6. Ability to test the data set by health economists researchers, present the characteristics of <br />the data set in person and via webinar to potential researcher users</p>
<p>Other important considerations.<br />No IT equipment will be provided by the Government.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance. July 2012 - July 2014 (with options to extend performance through July 2017)</p>
<p>Capability statement /information sought.<br />Capability statements should clearly state/describe your ability, experience, and resources to design and carry out the services above, including:</p>
<p>1) Staff expertise that would be working on this project, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training<br />2) Prior completed projects of similar nature<br />3) Your business size (number of employees and gross annual revenue), your eligibility under 8(a) or other set-aside programs, as applicable (note: the applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541720, 500 employees); and<br />4) Your management structure, history of your organization (e.g., number of years in business and DUNS #)</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes.<br />Please note that in order to qualify as an eligible small business for purposes of a small business set-aside, at least 50% of the direct labor cost must be in-house. Specifically, FAR 52.219-14 - Limitations on Subcontracting, states that at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Responses will be held in a confidential manner. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>
<p>If the Government decides to issue a solicitation, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available solely via the FEDBIZOPPS web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. It will be the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FEDBIZOPPS web page for the release of any solicitation and amendments, and to download the RFP and all attachments.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice should be received no later than the posted due date, and can be sent either by mail, fax, or e-mail (banderso@mail.nih.gov) to the point of contact listed. If using the U.S. Postal Service or commercial overnight services, please send an original plus five (5) copies of your response. Note: for commercial overnight services, use the Rockville, MD. 20852 address.</p>
<p>Confidentiality. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Water, Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW), Technical Support Center requires contractor support to provide technical, analytical, and administrative support services for the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation (UCMR).  
The Agency has the responsibility to investigate chemical and microbiological contaminant occurrence to characterize drinking water threats.  EPA relies on independent research efforts but also is heavily engaged in conducting occurrence studies to obtain new data.  The largest of these is the monitoring program mandated by the UCMR.  The UCMR is a cyclic monitoring program that allows OGWDW to evaluate contaminant occurrence in finished drinking water.  Every five years EPA selects, through the process of regulatory proposal and promulgation, a new group of contaminants for monitoring.  Data collected under UCMR can then be correlated with the consumer population to conduct an assessment of contaminant exposure.  This assessment supports OGWDW?s mandate to make determinations on the regulation of currently unregulated contaminants.
The purpose of this announcement is to identify potential small businesses with the capability to perform all or a portion of the requirements defined in the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and to further determine whether or not all or a portion of the work can be set-aside for potential small businesses sources.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services with a size standard of $7 Million.
All interested parties are hereby invited to submit a capability statement of no more than fifteen (15) pages, and no smaller than 12 point font.  The Government will evaluate each capability statement based on the interested party?s demonstrated qualifications, capabilities, expertise, experience, and past performance in each of the areas included in the paragraph below.  Additionally, interested parties should include a discussion of the capability of their accounting system or ability to implement a cost accounting system required of a cost-type contract.  Previous experience with cost-type government contracts should be discussed.  Interested parties should describe their ability to provide all necessary labor, materials, services, equipment, and facilities in support of the efforts required by the Draft PWS.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.
Tasks anticipated in this procurement include: 1) Coordinate the preparation and distribution of UCMR sample collection kits and collection of samples at selected small systems; 2) Coordinate and perform the collection of finished drinking water samples at selected small public water systems; 3) Provide outreach support to the UCMR implementation effort; 4) Collect and track data for the UCMR program; 5) Assist with contacting public water systems (or States) regarding UCMR responsibilities and monitoring requirements; 5) Assist with the design of UCMR Monitoring Plans and coordinate State review; 6) Assist with oversight and coordination of the UCMR laboratory approval program; 6) Produce reports and analyses in furtherance of regulatory development activities. 7) Provide administrative support in the planning and execution of workshops, conferences, or public meetings.
The resulting contract will include management of multiple, concurrent work assignments which will require long-term as well as quick-turn-around responses essential to the statutory responsibilities of the Office of Water.
The proposed contract will have a base period consisting of 12 months with five option periods of 12 months each, for a total potential period of performance of six years.  Total maximum level of effort for this six-year period of performance is 130,400 direct labor hours.  It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed-fee/level-of-effort contract will result from this solicitation.
Conflict of interest disclosures will be required from offerers under the standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) to certify that an offerer is unaware of any potential conflict of interest or to disclose any potential conflict of interest of which it is aware.  The offerer will also be required to comply with EPAAR 1552.209-71, requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest discovered after contract award.
The current projected start date of the contract is July 1, 2012.  The RFP will appear on the Internet under Solicitation Number SOL-CI-12-00010.  It may be accessed through the EPA?s home page on the World Wide Web (www.epa.gov).  The direct link URL is http://www.epa.gov/oam/solam.htm.  All responsible sources who submit a proposal will be considered by the Agency.  It is the responsibility of offerors to check FedBizOpps or the EPA website address for updates or changes.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available after December 1, 2011.
Interested parties should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hubzone, 8(a), women-owned, small disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern.  As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14). The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses. Responses to the above should be submitted to (Courtney Stallworth, USEPA, 26 West Martin Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, OH 45268, or stallworth.courtney@epa.gov) no later than 15 calendar days from date of posting. A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting from this sources source synopsis.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
<p>Brief description: Sources Sought for the Office of the Chief Financial Officer in Washington, DC. <br />Response Date: November 4, 2011; 12:00 EDT<br />Contract Specialist: Isaac Roper Charles - Ropercharles.isaac@dol.gov <br />Address: 200 Constitution Ave NW S-4306, Washington DC 20210<br />NAICS Code: 541219<br />Place of Performance: Frances Perkins Building, Washington DC, 20210</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and is not a solicitation on behalf of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). DOL does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the responses to this RFI or to otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government's use of such information. Depending on the information received in response to this RFI, the Department may issue a solicitation in the future.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The Department performs recovery audits on various grants, loans, and contracts in order to identify overpayments as a result of improper or erroneous actions. On July 22, 2010, the President signed in to law the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA). Under IPERA, any contractor performing the aforementioned requirement will be paid for its services based on a percentage of collections recovered. All payments for services must be made in accordance with the Act.</p>
<p>The Department is seeking information from certified public accounting firms to assist in the development of a plan to conduct payment recapture audits in accordance with IPERA.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Over the past several years, identifying and reducing improper payments has been a major financial management focus of the Federal Government. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) established the reporting requirements for improper payment activities. In August 2006, OMB issued Circular A-123, Appendix C - Requirements for Effective Measurement and Remediation of Improper Payments. On July 22, 2010, the President signed into law the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) of 2010 amending the IPIA to expand the requirements for identifying programs and activities susceptible to improper payments.</p>
<p>IPERA requires Federal agencies to conduct payment recapture audits for programs and activities with $1 million or more in annual outlays, if conducting such audits would be cost effective. This new law envisions that the payment recapture audits will largely come from any future recoveries. However, as described in IPERA Sec. 2(h)(3)(F)&amp;(G), IPERA also limits which categories of funds may be used to support and pay for such payment recapture audit activities. For example, IPERA restricts agencies from retaining any funds that are appropriated through mandatory funding authorities to conduct payment recapture audits (e.g., to pay contractors). The Act also prohibits agencies from retaining any funds that were not appropriated prior to enactment of IPERA, and for which the appropriation has not yet expired. Payments for all other amounts recovered would be subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p>Information Requested</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI should contain the following information:</p>
<p>1. Business name and address;<br />2. Name, title, and contact information of company representative;<br />3. Information on any contract vehicle available to the Government for the procurement of these types of services to include General Services Administration General Supply Schedule or any other Government Agency contract vehicle;<br />4. State of issuance of active Certified Public Accountant license;<br />5. Company's background information, size, and geographic presence nationwide;<br />6. History of performing recovery audits of federally funded grants and contracts including the ability to perform such audits in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, and all other applicable criteria pertaining to audits of State and local Governments, Educational Institutions, and not-for-profit organizations;</p>
<p>7. Proposed contingency fee payment structure; and</p>
<p>8. Describe any other considerations or factors that you believe should be included as part of the solicitation requirements.</p>

<a href="mailto:mpotts@usgs.gov">RFI Commercial Remote Sensing Data</a>
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.
The US Geological Survey is currently seeking sources for a follow on requirement for remote sensing data.  
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information for Solicitation and Planning Purposes (October 1997), this notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Department of the Interior (DOI)/U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to assess the responses to inform its decision-making. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to contract for services. The government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this notice and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with RFI submission. Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that might follow. Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such and the government will ensure this information is not released externally. The overarching objective for this RFI is information gathering and not development of possible government acquisition of products or services.
One of the missions of the USGS Land Remote Sensing (LRS) Program is to obtain commercially available remotely sensed high resolution satellite data over North America.  Currently, USGS has an established contract for satellite imagery composed of monthly coverage of Mexico north of the Tropic of Cancer, the entire 48 conterminous United States, the U.S. territorial waters of the conterminous United States, and Canada south of the 55 degrees north latitude line.  The government is contemplating a follow-on contract in order to continue to serve the needs of the USGS Programs and Disciplines, Department of Interior bureaus, the Federal civil community, state, local, and tribal governments as well as Federal civil community project partners.  In order to fulfill the requirement, your company must possess an operational satellite system or an acquisition service that can negotiate for and distribute near real-time remote sensing satellite data. Possession of bulk purchasing and direct downlinks must also be an option. 
Interested concerns who believe they have the capability to provide the required services as defined are invited to submit a Capability Statement, not to exceed 10 pages.  Responses should also include the following information:  company name, address, DUNS number, point of contact, email address, business type, and approximate cost information (i.e., rough order of magnitude).  Past performance information should be submitted for projects of this nature conducted within the last three (3) years.  
USGS is a strong advocate for the small business community and interested small businesses/lead teams and joint ventures that qualify as small businesses are especially encouraged to submit a response to this notice and should identify the business name and business size [large, small, 8(a), etc.].  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541360 Geophysical Surveying and Mapping Services, with a size standard of $4.5.
To notify the Government of sensitive information, data identified as Proprietary [e.g., 41 USC section 423, the Procurement Integrity Act restrictive legend per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-1)] contained in a response to this RFI, offerors shall mark the cover page of the response and each affected page of the response with indications that it contains proprietary information.  The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a response if it is not marked proprietary.
Please submit all responses and any questions to this notice by Monday, November 7, 2011, via email to the Contracting Officer, Meridith Potts, at mpotts@usgs.gov.  Responses received after this date will not be evaluated.  No feedback or evaluations will be provided regarding the information provided.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial services are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.

BACKGROUND

The Department of Veterans Affairs, National Office of Clinical Consultation and Compliance (OCCC) consists of a National office, seven (7) Regional offices in the continental United States and 85 employees.  The OCCC serves to educate and support 156 healthcare facilities and their associated clinics and satellite campuses on the implementation of a customized Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Quality Management System (QMS) consistent to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2008 ("ISO 9001") requirements.  The OCCC implementation strategy is based on the Collaborative model for the diffusion of known knowledge within the VHA, developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) along with the VA Office of Systems Redesign.  

The VHA created a T-21 Scope Action Plan Initiative to implement an ISO 9001 consistent QMS within Sterile Processing Department/Reusable Medical Equipment (SPD/RME) operations throughout VHA.  Thus, the ISO 9001 Collaborative implementation will start with the SPD/RME operations and continue on to additional priority areas.  The OCCC requires assistance with the development, design, training, and realization of this Collaborative implementation program for the customized ISO 9001 QMS within VHA.  The ISO 9001 QMS implementation will be accomplished through multiple Collaborative Learning Sessions, consultative visits, assessments, special training, the use of common communication platforms, and other types of training as need dictates.  The expertise required under this contract is specific to design, training, and implementation of a customized ISO 9001 QMS in large (150 beds or over) integrated healthcare organizations/hospital facilities who provide both inpatient and outpatient services. The geographic coverage of the collaborative implementation and consultative visits includes national, regional, and local training and implementation anywhere within the continental United States.  If the contractor is a certification body, said contractor will be precluded from providing future certification auditing to the VA for the purpose of ISO 9001:2008 certification.  This time or preclusion begins at the end of this contract period and lasts for a period of three (3) years.  Reference: ISO 17021.

SCOPE

The Collaborative rollout of the VHA/SPD specific, ISO 9001 consistent QMS involves the following elements:
"	Phase I (Pilot) Collaborative (rolled out within seven (7) previously selected VHA facilities.)  To include:
o	Assignment and coaching to pre-work
o	Coaches training and follow on support
"	Phase II (National rollout) Collaborative (remaining VHA facilities)
o	Assignment and coaching to pre-work
o	Coaches training and follow on support
"	At least three (3) Learning Sessions for each Collaborative (one session for each module of the designed QMS or as otherwise designed.)  Combined, the modules will cover, at least, the quality manual and the six (6) required procedures of the ISO 9001 Standard.
o	Learning Sessions are generally face-to-face programs (but may be run virtually) that bring teams from the front line together with their coaches to learn how to implement the designed QMS within SPD/RME operations. 
"	Completion of pre-work by the implementation teams, including identifying team members, gathering and analyzing relevant data and other actions related to the implementation work.
"	An Action Period occurs between each Learning Session.  During the Action Periods, the Collaborative teams implement each module of the designed QMS, test the changes, monitor the impact of their changes, etc.  
"	Conference calls: During these Action Periods the Collaborative Co-Directors conduct conferences calls with coaches, the planning & steering groups and the teams during which time, the teams report on their progress and obtain guidance on challenges or barriers they are experiencing. 
"	Team reports will be submitted by the implementation teams to report on their accomplishments, are reviewed by the teams' coaches and written feedback provided.   

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 611430, Professional and Management Development Training, and size standard is $7.0 million.

STATEMENT OF WORK for
Career Development Training

Objective: The West Texas VA Health care System (WTVAHCS) located at 300 Veteran's Blvd., Big Spring, TX, requires a qualified Contractor to provide an on-site educational program to address the career development needs of facility employees in grades GS-01 thru GS-05 and Wage Grade equivalents. Employees need to develop computer and organizational skills, as well as improving their abilities in math, reading, grammar, writing, medical terminology, and medical ethics.   

Goal:  The goal of the training program is to develop a highly skilled, customer-focused work force that will provide exemplary leadership for the 21st century. The program will provide career development opportunities to employees who are hard-working, committed to a future in healthcare, and have potential, but cannot advance without more education. This program is intended as the initial step in the VHA succession plan pipeline for the WTVAHCS.

Description of Requirement: The contractor must provide a packaged learning system that will be delivered within the WTVAHCS using methods that conform to the needs of adult learners. Studies have shown that a blended system of on-line coursework, DVD classroom sessions, and participant workbooks will address these needs with the greatest success. 

The contractor will provide all tools and materials to be used in a system that will be facilitated locally by a member of the Education Service staff. This staff member will serve as a project manager: overseeing classroom activities, providing mentoring, keeping attendance, monitoring the students' progress, and administering examinations. The project manager will require access to Contractor personnel to address any issues that may come up and answer any questions about the Contractor's program or its procedures.   

Challenge: Currently, the WTVAHCS has limited opportunities for employees in grades GS-01 thru GS-05 and equivalent Wage Grades. Those employees who feel "stuck" in entry-level positions need to be provided with new learning opportunities and better chances to succeed by improving their upward mobility, talent, and patient care. 

To improve diversity within the organization and to improve EEO performance, there is a need to have employees learning new tasks and developing their skills in order to be successful in their career advancement.  The contractor must provide a program that will address these challenges and provide employees with greater opportunities for success.

Qualifications for Entry in the Program: Employees will be required to take and pass the standardized Test of Adult Basic Education (T.A.B.E.) which the Contractor must provide. To be eligible for enrollment into the selected Contractor's program, student employees will be require to have a minimum reading level of 9th grade equivalent, which will be determined from the results of the T.A.B.E.

Training Benefits Expected: The program selected will enhance upward mobility opportunities for GS 1-5 and Wage Grade equivalent employees. The program will prepare employees for effective competition in other leadership programs, will encompass a pro-active EEO approach, and will prepare the participants to enroll in local certificate and degree programs. These benefits will also improve the participants' job performance, boost employee morale, improve retention, and help the facility institute a Career Ladder System.

Correlation to the VHA High Performance Development Model (HPDM): One of HPDM's most important objectives is to oversee a range of workforce development programs that provide career advancement opportunities to VHA employees at every level of the organization. The program selected will use adult learning principles to engage participants and will also provide a curriculum written in a healthcare context. Participants in the program will learn personal mastery, interpersonal effectiveness, customer service, flexibility/adaptability, creative thinking, systems thinking, and organizational stewardship.  The overall concept of the requirement is to give individuals the information they need to begin their careers at VA.

Period of Performance: To provide continuity and minimize administration, this acquisition should be established as a contract consisting of a base year and four option years. The periods covered will be calendar year (January through December) 2012, with options for 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

Information Security & Privacy: Contractor personnel are not expected to work on-site at the WTVAHCS; however, security protocols are established as follows:

a.	Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

b.	Contractor staff will not have access to VA sensitive information or information systems.

c.	The contractor/subcontractor agrees to comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) and the agency rules and regulations issued under the Act.

<RESPDATE>103111
<CONTACT>James Sweeney, Program Manager, Phone (937)904-8125, Email james.sweeney@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>You are cordially invited to participate in the 2nd Annual Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Dialogue with Industry (ADI) conference - Featuring the Air Independent Research &amp; Development (IR&amp;D) Technology Interchange Workshop on 1-3 November 2011. This conference will feature a number of senior officials with the latest information on DoD programs and challenges, including the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Dr. Ashton Carter. Plan on joining ASC and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Hope Hotel &amp; Conference Center, 3660 State Route 444, Fairborn, Ohio 45324 and the Advanced Technology Intelligence Center (ATIC), 2685 Hibiscus Way, Beavercreek, Ohio 45431. You will gain insight about ASC's acquisition and sustainment challenges and AFRL's Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) efforts to help ASC meet the needs of the warfighter. ASC is the largest of four (4) product centers in the Air Force Materiel Command and executes an annual budget of $23 Billion. ASC is responsible for the design, development, and delivery of dominant aerospace weapon systems and capabilities for the U.S. Air Force, other U.S. military services, and allied and coalition partners. Learn about new business opportunities in the ASC and AFRL portfolios, Air Force Major Commands (ACC, AMC, AFSOC, AETC, and AFGSC). Hear about the latest status of the ASC Acquisition of Consolidated Enterprise Support Services (ACCESS) contract.
<p>This year, a new feature will provide an opportunity to participate in the Air IR&amp;D program Step 1 (of 3) workshop, whereby industry is exposed to an integrated voice from the relevant MAJCOMs, ASC, and AFRL addressing capability gaps, technology needs, and S&amp;T solutions. The IR&amp;D Step 2 is planned for approximately four months after the Step 1 event, and is the opportunity for the industry partners to present their IR&amp;D initiatives to the government team, based on what they learned in the Step 1 workshop. The Step 2 workshop has a one-on-one format where individual companies that participated in the Step 1 will be afforded an opportunity to brief the government team of Subject Matter Experts (SME) on IR&amp;D initiatives selected by the government from all abstract submissions prior to the Step 2 event. Step 3 then becomes the period of assessment and alignment whereby the AF team considers the relevant IR&amp;D programs for Program Objectives Memorandum (POM) planning for mapping into AFRL and ASC strategic plans, and for continuing the dialogue with industry on expediting potential partnerships.</p>
<p>Please note that all ADI conference attendees must either be a Department of Defense (DoD) employee or DoD contractor with a valid DD 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, certification.</p>

Note taking will only be allowed on notepads provided at the event. The note pads must be turned in at the end of the event per the security procedures and will be returned to the respective owners after the event.

The CAC serves as both a visual confirmation of a user's identity as well as a digital authentication token. Complemented with a corresponding smart card reader, the CAC enables users to access DoD computers, networks, and facilities as well as encrypt and cryptographically sign email using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). <br><br>As the DoD workforce shifts from a physical desktop-oriented work environment to a virtually-connected mobile office presence, the reliance on CAC readers to provide a means of identity authentication has become outdated and cumbersome. With computing technologies moving towards more agile and travel-friendly form factors, like smartphones and tablets, the need for an equally mobile and integrated solution to provide user authentication is paramount in order to elicit wide acceptance and adoption from the DoD community.<br>2.0	Introduction<br><br>This RFI is a means of technical discovery and information gathering from members of industry. Program Management Network and Enterprise Services (PM NES) seeks to (1) become familiar with the current state of the market with respect to hardware and software-based certificate solutions and (2) identify commercially available technologies that could lend themselves well to user-based authentication in a mobile environment and be cost-effective to deploy across millions of users throughout DoD.<br><br>3.0	Vendor Instructions<br><br>DISCLAIMER<br>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THE RFI.<br><br>This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to the RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.

However, the importance of adapting to these newly emerging technologies while also adhering to existing security policies and requirements poses major challenges moving forward. In the realm of CMDs, it is widely known that most mobile operating systems (OS) lack the basic functionality necessary to meet minimum DoD security requirements for protecting personal, military, and enterprise data. Therefore, the need to augment existing systems with additional administrative components as part of a greater architecture becomes paramount to ensuring security and functionality across a variety of mobile device platforms.<br><br>Some of the hurdles include, but are not limited to, the securing, monitoring, and management of CMDs. In addition, the provisioning and updating of these devices at an enterprise-level poses great challenges as DoD moves towards wide proliferation of devices and tablets. Overall, the obstacles faced by the DoD community can be potentially mitigated by utilizing a mobile device management (MDM) system capable of providing a central administrative framework for tracking and monitoring CMDs as well as ensuring security policy compliance among end-point devices. <br><br>2.0	Introduction<br><br>This RFI is issued as a means of technical discovery and information gathering. Program Management Network and Enterprise Services (PM NES) seeks to (1) become familiar with the current state of the MDM market, specifically to validate available MDM features and capabilities in existence today,  (2) identify those MDM companies which are exceeding the inherent supported baseline functionality of current device platforms and applying innovative approaches to providing a greater security and enterprise management model in their MDM platforms. PM NES seeks this information from industry, particularly from MDM vendors who specialize in the following types of mobile device management:<br><br> 	Software Distribution - The ability to manage and support mobile application use including deploy, install, update, delete or block.<br><br> 	Policy Management - Development, control and operations of DoD enterprise mobile access, connectivity, and security policy. <br><br> 	Inventory Management - Software, firmware, hardware, and peripheral device inventory management, this includes provisioning and support. <br><br> 	Security Management - The implementation and enforcement of DoD-level device security, authentication, validation and encryption functionality. <br><br>3.0	Vendor Instructions<br><br>DISCLAIMER<br>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THE RFI.<br><br>This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.

Does your MDM solution perform some type of device health and/or integrity monitoring? If so, please describe.<br>43.	Can your MDM solution provide intelligent reporting and trend analysis on security-related events to recognize unusual, and potentially malicious, patterns with devices within the enterprise? Please explain.<br><br>Application<br><br>44.	What unique features does your MDM solution have to support application policy management? <br>45.	Does your MDM solution have an application blacklisting/whitelisting capability? <br>46.	To what extent can your MDM solution monitor the access, download, installation, and execution of applications?<br>47.

Can your MDM solution create administrative policies based on user group? What about creating policies for multi-layered hierarchical user groups that require different levels of security and compliance? For example, an infantry group could set its own policies in addition to any policy that it inherits from the Army, which also inherits policies from the DoD.  Consequently, setting policies of any group in the multi-tiered hierarchical path would have no effect on any group outside that path, nor could it allow a lower tier group to delete any higher level group set policies.<br>56.	Can your MDM solution restrict lower tiered managers from changing/deleting policies enacted by higher level managers? Conversely, would it allow lower tiered managers the ability to enforce stricter policies than those enacted by higher level managers?<br>57.	Can your MDM solution manage policies based on particular hardware model?<br>58.	Can your MDM solution leverage location-based services to enforce compliance policies?

Can your MDM solution provide designated alerts to another enterprise network management application using SNMPv3 or SNMPv2 with IPSec tunnel?<br>65.	Can your MDM solution create acceptable use policies for using an enterprise device for personal use?<br>66.	Can your MDM solution create different policies for employee-owned devices and company-owned devices?<br><br>Service<br><br>67.	Can your MDM solution allow for multi-tiered helpdesk support?  For example, an Army civilian would get helpdesk support from the Army but it is the same application supporting all of the various helpdesks.  Additionally, the Army helpdesk profile would allow them to only view Army devices and not the other Services, but the OSD level profile would have access to all helpdesk information.<br>68.	Can your MDM solution provide centralized administration and a single management repository for all devices managed by the enterprise but provide multi-tier management/role capability (managing hierarchal groups) in accessing mobile device information and setting policies?<br>69.	What type of reporting and business intelligence (BI) tools do you offer with your MDM product? Please provide a description of what kinds of device status reports can be produced using your tools? Are they comprised of both text and statistical graphics? Are they canned reports or can they be customized by the client?<br>70.	Can your MDM solution provide helpdesk functionality troubleshooting tools, report generation, historical analysis, and problem triage?<br>71.	Can your MDM solution provide reports and trend analysis on mobile service usage to view calls made/received, data download/upload usage, SMS usage, application downloads, toll calls, overages, inactive phones, and roaming charges? <br>72.

Can your MDM solution support over-the-air (OTA) provisioning to which OS and version type devices? <br>76.	Can your MDM solution create configuration profiles (sometimes referred to as templates) that simplify the process of provisioning based on vendor, operating system, or model type?<br>77.	Can your MDM solution provide an audit trail capability? Many enterprises must comply with government regulations (e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard [PCI-DSS] and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]) and must demonstrate their compliance with these regulations. Some MDM systems provide the ability to produce a provisioning audit trail and a resultant compliance report that can assist enterprises with their regulatory compliance-reporting obligations. Please describe in detail.<br>7.0	Constraints<br>The following constraints should be identified and mitigation processes defined in industry responses.<br><br> 	Compliance with Army security policies, guidelines and architectures including Top Level Architecture (TLA), Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) reporting, monitoring, etc. <br> 	DIACAP Authority to Operate (ATO)<br> 	Certificate to Operation (CTO)<br> 	Certificate of Networthiness (CON)<br> 	Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) <br> 	IPv6 Transition Preparation <br> 	Clinger-Cohen Act (CCA) Compliance <br> 	Information Assurance Strategy (AIS) - Required for CCA compliance and the others <br> 	Global Information Grid Bandwidth Expansion (GIG BE) connectivity <br> 	Continuity of Operations (COOP) and Disaster Recovery (DR)  <br> 	Army Environmental/Facilities requirements (if applicable), specifically: <br>o	Infrastructure  <br>o	Physical Security  <br>o	Survivability  <br>o	Time lines  <br>o	Required footprint/floor space<br>o	Approvals and Ownership  <br>8.0	Transition and Transformation<br>In any organization, change is always challenging.  It is the Army's intent to transition and transform the user community to the MDM as transparently, seamlessly, and expeditiously as possible.  As such, it is requested that industry address the following additional items in their response to this RFI.<br> 	A successful mitigation plan for past transitions in the commercial or Federal marketplace.<br> 	Any capabilities that exist for users to perform a "Self-Service" migration <br> 	Any issues and mitigation techniques related to migrating devices into the new Enterprise solution.<br> 	Levels of service currently being provided in the commercial or Federal marketplace and their key performance parameters <br> 	Strategies for identifying and resolving recurring and systemic problems with the MDM system<br> 	Current methodology for providing Tier 2/Tier 3 level support services<br> 	An expected "start up" period of time in calendar days, from date of award through service provision, including installation, Information Assurance (IA) accreditations and certifications. <br> 	How would the transition of data to a new service provider (commercial or government) at the end of the contract be performed?<br>

<DESC>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT's) Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) plans to award a contract, purchase order or delivery order to Metro Technical Services for audio visual services in support of the 44th Annual Secretary Awards Ceremony. This contract will be awarded with a period of performance of November 1 - 3, 2011. These services will include leasing, installation, testing and operating Audio Visual production equipment for the awards ceremony, as well as additional services outlined in the attached Statement of Work. The estimated budget for this requirement is NTE $15,000.00. <br /><br />USDOT has no other option for providing the support services needed from Metro Technical Services because it is the only source that can provide the measure of expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance necessary to meet our program requirements. Due to unusual and compelling urgency the award for this year's support will go to Metro Technical Services.
<p>Although the Government will continue to evaluate, on an ongoing basis, any interest shown by sources interested in competing for this requirement on subsequent acquisitions, it is not expected that any vendor other than National Academy of Sciences will be able to provide this maintenance. <br />Nevertheless, any entity, other than Metro Technical Services, which believes they can provide the needed services to OST, shall submit a capability statement to Pamala.millbrook.ctr@dot.gov no later than 12:00 PM EST on November 8, 2011. Your submission will be added to the vendor list for the upcoming BPA for Audio Visual Support services, maintenance and equipment purchase.</p>

This search software is one component in the USPTO's Automated Biotechnology Sequence Search (ABSS) system. The current ABSS system runs on a cluster of IBM HS20 blades. ABSS is designed to accept and store electronic sequence listing data submitted in applications, and support searching of polynucleotide and polypeotide sequences using data stored from both applicant submissions and public and commercial database of published sequence information. The purpose of the ABSS system is to sustain the USTPO's business function of performing prior-art searching of polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences claimed in patent applications examined by the USPTO's biotechnology center. The current search software (GENCORE Version 6) is currently provided by Biocceleration, Inc. <br /><br />Any proposed software must meet the requirements set forth in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, be Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 compliant, and would enable examiners to align biosequences using a wide variety of algorithms and provide facility for sequence manipulation and editing functions. The mandatory requirements for this software will be included in the solicitation. The USPTO reserves the right to request demonstration, if necessary, on Government-owned hardware.
<p>This acquisition will be conducted as a full and open competition requirement with a period of performance of a 1-year base period and two 1-year option periods with contract award to a single vendor. The NAICS Code associated with this project is 541511 - Other Computer Related Services (size standard: $25M). The solicitation is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about October 25, 2011 and will ONLY be available via the Internet at the USPTO Procurement web site at <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/">http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/</a>.&nbsp; (See solicitation/website for proposal due date and time).<br /><br />Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the website for ALL information related to the procurement including any solicitation amendments. Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract. There is no written solicitation document available and telephone calls requesting a solicitation will not be accepted or acknowledged. No bidders list will be maintained.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Mr.Tseyen-Oidov ORKHON<br />President and CEO<br />MIAT Mongolian Airlines<br />Buyant - Ukhaa 45<br />Ulaanbaatar 210134<br />Tel: 976-11-379643<br />Fax: 976-11-379919</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance in the development of strategic business and restructuring plans for MIAT Mongolian Airlines.</p>
<p>A U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) grant of $400,000 will assist MIAT Airlines (MIAT), Mongolia's state-owned carrier, in the development of a new strategic business and airline restructuring plan. This activity will support MIAT's planned fleet expansion and help to ensure greater air transport infrastructure for Mongolia's continued economic growth.</p>
<p>This grant activity will provide access to expert technical guidance, industry expertise and executive-level training through a series of workshops for MIAT's senior management aimed at developing a consolidated business plan. The strategic plan will include a short-term plan to 2015, long-term plan to 2020, and an airline restructuring plan. This activity will support MIAT's fleet expansion, including a contract signed with Boeing in April 2011 for purchase of three aircraft: one 767-300ER and two 737-800s.</p>
<p>In June 2011, during a visit to the United States by the Mongolian President Tsakhia Elbegdorj, USTDA and MIAT executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding technical assistance to encourage the development of Mongolia's civil aviation sector and address training and capacity building to assist MIAT in the successful operation and expansion of the airline. The MOU was signed in Washington, D.C. by USTDA Director Leocadia Zak and MIAT Airlines President Orkhon Tseyen-Oidov on June 6, 2011.</p>
<p>Since it began operation in 1956, MIAT has operated leased aircraft. Purchase of the Boeing aircraft in 2011 represents a significant expansion for the government-owned airline. A landlocked country with great expanses of low-population density areas in and outside its borders, Mongolia relies on air travel for much of its business and trade activities. In recent years, Mongolia's considerable mineral deposits have grown exponentially in estimation of both size and monetary value. The current and projected revenues from the largest mines (Talvan Tolgoi and Oyu Tolgoi) have already boosted the country's economic position and are projected to add significantly to GDP for the foreseeable future. The impact is expected to become even greater due to the growing demand for coal and other mineral resources from China, Mongolia's southern neighbor. This economic growth both requires greater air transportation volume and gives Mongolia the wherewithal to acquire its own fleet of aircraft.</p>
<p>In light of its recent expansion, MIAT has put forward a proposal for technical assistance that will help the company develop a business and restructuring plan to support greater air transport infrastructure. In the development of these plans, MIAT's specific needs include:</p>
<p>1) Strengths, weakness, opportunity, and threats (SWOT) analysis;<br />2) Strategic plan for offered services;<br />3) Market, operations, financial, and management restructuring plan; and,<br />4) Capitalization plan and implementation schedule</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $400,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.

 (b) Submission of offers. The proposal shall consist of three separate parts as listed below. Offeror is due before or the exact time specified in this solicitation.

(In accordance with FAR 15.101-2) The Government intends to award without discussion with respective offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

The competitive range shall be comprised of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency pursuant to FAR 15.306 (c) (2). The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:

1. Technical Acceptability: The Government's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) shall evaluate the offeror's technical proposal on a pass/fail basis.
 
 2. Past Performance: Offerors are required to demonstrate recent (within the last three years), successful performance under contracts (ongoing or complete) which are similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to the subject requirement.
 
 3. Price: Award will be made to the offeror that proposes the lowest price and is determine to be technically acceptable.
 
 (d) Procedures:
 
 All offerors will be required to prepare and submit their complete proposal submission in accordance with the proposal preparation instructions in Provision 52.212-1 of this request for proposal.  Proposals and other information will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria stated in this provision

(e) EVALUATION APPROACH

1. TECHNICAL:

(i) Assessment: The offeror's proposal shall, as a minimum, address each of the technical proposal criteria as they apply to the SOW.  During evaluations of each proposal, the Government will assess each area of the Technical Proposal to ensure the offeror meets or exceeds the standards of the contract.  The Government will evaluate the technical proposal based on the evaluation criteria described in Section A through B below, which are tailored to specific principal tasks in the SOW.  The Government will infer from the offeror's responses to these specified evaluation criteria the offeror's capability to perform to the requirements of the entire SOW.  In order to be considered for award, the offeror must demonstrate the ability to provide adequate and qualified staff and expertise to satisfy the statement of work requirements by describing or providing the information requested below:

The evaluation of the technical proposal will consider the following:

A) Provide C-16 License and certification from Ansual and related Automatic Fire Control Systems. 

B) Certification from International Kitchen Exhaust Cleaning Association (IKECA) or equivalent association exhaust cleaning specialists (CECS) or document compliance of all NFPA 96 2011 (or latest) grease hood cleaning qualifications and certifications

2.  PAST PERFORMANCE:
 
(i) Factor Assessment: The purpose of Past Performance evaluation is to assess the degree of confidence the Government will have in an Offeror's ability to provide services that meet customer needs.  The Past Performance evaluation will assess how relevant the Offeror's contracts on previous efforts of similar size and scope to this acquisition have been rated by their customers.  The evaluation will focus on and target performance that is relevant to the principal tasks of the SOW, (i.e. providing annual and semi-annual cleaning and fire protection services/ certification of the following grease hoods, exhaust fans, and chemical storage sheds).   More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the performance confidence assessment than less recent and/or less relevant effort.  A performance confidence rating will be assigned based on the offeror's ability to perform the requirements of this solicitation

 (ii)  Description of factor:

(A) The Government will conduct a past performance review of each competitive offeror.  Evaluations will be based on present and past performance information provided by the Offeror and gathered from various sources.  In addition to the information provided by the Offeror's customers, the Government reserves the right to use data obtained from other Government and commercial sources.

(B) Recent:  A contract is considered recent when performance of the effort is ongoing or has been completed within the past 3 years.  Current performance will have a greater impact in the confidence assessment than less recent performance.  

(C) Relevancy:  The government will perform an independent determination of data relevancy, provided or obtained.  The main assessment of relevancy focuses on capability and magnitude.  Capability assesses whether the work being performed in the reference is similar to the work in our requirement.  Magnitude defines whether the amount of work in the reference is similar to the amount of work in our requirement.  An effort is considered relevant when there is a logical connection with document destruction services.  The scope of past performance information in value and size shall also be considered in determining relevancy.   More relevant performance will have a greater impact on the confidence assessment than less relevant effort.

(D) Performance:  The government will perform an independent determination for each contract reference, provided or obtained.  

(iii) A lack of relevant past performance information shall be rated as an unknown performance risk, having no positive or negative significance.  A strong record of relevant or semi-relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than a "Neutral/Unknown confidence" rating.  Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance.   

(v) Where the performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems.  The Government will also consider the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised) to resolve problems.  Offerors will have the opportunity to address any negative or adverse past performance information received during this evaluation (subject to the restrictions of FAR 15.306 (e) (4), for which they have not had an opportunity to address in the past.

3. PRICE:

(i) Factor Assessment:  This criteria evaluates the overall price (i.e. aggregate for all five years of performance) to determine if the proposed price is fair and reasonable.  The Government may determine an offer unacceptable if the proposed prices are materially unbalanced which is defined as significantly understated or overstated in relation to the actual cost of that work or when the price is determined not to be fair and reasonable.    The individual unit prices listed in Price Schedule will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed by FAR 15.404-1(b).

(ii) Ratings:  Price proposals will be evaluated, but not rated.

(iii) Description of factor:  The Government will conduct a price review of each contract line item.  Evaluations will be based on a comparison of the aggregate price of all offerors.  The aggregate price is the sum of all five years for contract line items 0001 through 4001.

<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>STATEMENT OF WORK&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>1. Introduction <br />In accordance with OMB requirements for consolidation and virtualization, the Job Corps Data Center is pursuing the opportunity to meet these goals by using energy efficient storage arrays to backend a virtualized computing environment. This project will allow Job Corps to collapse all existing production and development servers and applications on to more energy efficient storage arrays thus allowing the ability to scale virtualized resources to meet customer demands.</p>
<p>2. Background<br />Through a nationwide network of campuses, Job Corps offers a comprehensive array of career development services to at-risk young women and men, ages 16 to 24, to prepare them for successful careers. Job Corps employs a holistic career development training approach which integrates the teaching of academic, vocational, employability skills and social competencies through a combination of classroom, practical and work based learning experiences to prepare youth for stable, long-term, high-paying jobs.<br />There are 128 Job Corps centers and satellite centers located throughout the United States including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. The Job Corps Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Network (WAN) supports approximately 65,000 users. <br />The Job Corps Data Center (JCDC) technical staff is responsible for the design, development and deployment of Information Technology projects for Job Corps. The JCDC technical staff is responsible for defining the requirements for all IT equipment and will be responsible for configuration and deployment of the Storage Arrays into all production and development computing environments. <br />Job Corps is in the process of enhancing a private cloud infrastructure that will support the Job Corps CDSS Suite of Applications, and consists of virtual servers, a unified fabric (Fibre Channel over Ethernet) and advanced shared storage. The goal of the private cloud is to provide a scalable computing environment that can expand and shrink in accordance with demand.<br />This Statement of Work has been designed to address requirements defined by OMB in the Data Center Consolidation Program and meet the goals of the DCCP initiative.</p>
<p>3. Objective<br />The objective of this project is to replace all non-energy efficient legacy storage arrays and to decrease the IT physical footprint in order to lower infrastructure cost in compliance with OMB mandates. This project will also enable Job Corps to give their students and staff more storage space for applications, data, and email. Management of these storage arrays shall be centralized and managed at the Job Corps Data Center in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>4. Business Environment <br />Integration and Configuration of the storage arrays will take place at the Job Corps Data Center in Austin, Texas.<br />The Job Corps Data Center (JCDC) hours of operation are from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

<DESC><p>In order to stay aligned with its mission to support our citizens and first responders to ensure that as a nation we work together to build, sustain, and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Louisiana Recovery Office (LRO) is hosting a Disaster Contracting Industry Day. The purpose of the Industry Day is to inform local businesses about future requirements and to gain industry insight regarding best practices and standards to assist with requirements development. <br />Since each disaster is unique and brings new challenges and opportunities, the types of requirements needed to support the mission vary. The following is a sample list of requirements that may be needed based upon historical data:<br />&bull; Purchase of temporary housing units (THU)<br />&bull; Hauling and installation of THUs<br />&bull; Maintenance of THUs<br />&bull; Deactivation of THUs<br />&bull; Site preparation<br />&bull; Portable toilets<br />&bull; Base camps<br />&bull; Light towers<br />&bull; Grounds maintenance <br />&bull; Forklift rentals<br />&bull; Archeological studies <br />&bull; Temporary staffing services<br />&bull; Advertisement services<br />&bull; Janitorial services<br />&bull; Debris Removal<br />&bull; Food Service<br />&bull; Laundry Service<br />&bull; Hotel Contracts<br />&bull; Transportation Services<br />Key personnel will be on hand to explain FEMA's role during a disaster and to answer questions. Additionally, in order to support and further foster successful business participation, presentations on how to respond to notices for federal opportunities and Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will be given.<br />Companies are asked to register by Friday, October 21, 2011. The first 40 registered companies wanting to present their capabilities to FEMA personnel in one-on-one breakout sessions will be allowed five (5) minutes to present. <br />The Industry Day event is free and open to all interested businesses, although Louisiana businesses are especially encouraged to attend since requirements resulting in contracts or blanket purchase agreements will be awarded to businesses residing or primarily doing business in the state of Louisiana.<br />In compliance with DHS Acquisition Alert 12-02, Identification will be required at check-in. No meals or beverages will be provided at the event.<br />Submission of capability statement does not constitute a formal proposal submission, that it is only to be used for Government market research efforts, and that it cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.<br />Submission of a capability statement is voluntary and DHS will not provide reimbursement costs in preparing abstracts.<br />DHS is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to vendors with respect to any information the vendor submitted.<br />Submission of a capability statement does not constitute a RFP or Government sponsorship of contractor charges against any existing Government contract for attendance or proposals efforts.<br />Any information submitted in response to sources sought/request for information (e.g., capability statement) is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, USC 552(a).<br />The Government does not request any proprietary information be submitted, nor shall it be liable, for any consequential damages for any proprietary information.<br />Prior to the event, all Industry Day presenters shall seek approval of content of presentations for the Head of Contracting Activity.<br />Post briefing slides of Industry Day to Federal Business Opportunities no later than four (4) days after the Industry Day. <br />The event will be held on Friday, October 28, 2011 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. at Dillard University, Professional Schools Building, Georges Auditorium, 2601 Gentilly Boulevard, New Orleans, LA 70122. Those planning to attend should submit the attached registration form to Ashly.J.Banks@dhs.gov and Anthony.Collins@dhs.gov.</p>

It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this Notice.

<DESC>This acquisition is a <strong>100% Small Business Set-Aside</strong>. Responses under this Notice will be considered only from entities classified as small businesses under NAICS Code 541310, Architectural Services, and must have average annual revenues of $4.5 Million or less to meet this requirement. All partners of Joint-Venture respondents must be classified as Small Businesses under the applicable NAICS Code to be eligible for consideration. Responses from all other firms are ineligible for consideration.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Division of Engineering Services - Dallas, of the Indian Health Service (IHS), on behalf of the Albuquerque and Navajo Area Indian Health Services, Office of Environmental Health and Engineering, seeks Qualifications statements of Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to provide professional design services for various projects. Qualifications documents submitted in response to this notice will be used to select the highest qualified A-E firm to issue a Request for Proposal for various rates and eventual award of an Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under which individual projects will be awarded on separate delivery orders after a firm fixed-price is negotiated based on various applicable rates established under the basic IDIQ contract with that firm.<br /><br />Professional services comprise planning, design, and related A-E services including construction contract administration and post-construction contract services for various federal and tribal health facilities and support facilities located in Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado. Health facilities include medical centers, hospitals, dental clinics, healthcare clinics, support facilities and buildings, and associated infrastructure ranging in size from 1,000 square feet to 256,000 square feet. Under this potential contract, IHS plans to conduct projects to perform major maintenance, periodic repair of building components, and facility improvements. There would be little potential to design new facilities based on current projections.<br /><br />The work will primarily involve requirements for federally operated Indian Health facilities at or near the following localities but may be at any location the Albuquerque or Navajo Area of the Indian Health Service are responsible for:
<p>Albuquerque, NM Bernalillo, NM<br />Dulce, NM Mescalero, NM<br />San Felipe, NM San Fidel, NM<br />Santa Fe, NM Taos, NM<br />Zuni, NM Ignacio, CO<br />Towaoc, CO<br />Bloomfield, NM<br />Chinle, AZ Crownpoint, NM<br />Gallup, NM Inscription House, AZ<br />Kayenta, AZ Pinon, AZ<br />Pueblo Pintado, NM Red Mesa, AZ<br />Shiprock, NM <br />Sonostee, NM <br />Tohatchi, NM Toadlena, AZ<br />Tsaile, AZ</p>
<p>The resultant IDIQ contract will contain negotiated rates for use to establish firm fixed-prices for delivery order projects. That IDIQ contract will be for a base period of one year from the date of award with four one-year options that may be exercised at the Government's discretion. IHS anticipates awarding a contract to a single firm for this IDIQ requirement.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Required Architect-Engineer Services<br /></span></strong>Services that would be required under individual delivery orders include, but are not limited to, the following:<br /><br />a. Evaluation, Assessment, and Planning Services: facility condition assessments; site development feasibility studies; conceptual designs; cost estimating; space planning and space efficiency studies; energy modeling and investment-grade energy feasibilities studies; building systems evaluations; electrical studies including short-circuit and arc-flash coordination studies, load studies, selective breaker coordination and evaluation of power quality problems; pre-design commissioning recommendations; legal survey work for real property transfers including metes and bounds surveys.<br /><br />b. Design Services: development of design and construction documents (i.e. drawings, specifications) and associated engineering work in accordance with the most current Indian Health Service "Architect/Engineer (A/E) Design Guide".<br /><br />c. Construction Contract Administration and other A-E related services: participating in pre-construction conferences; responding to construction contractor requests for information (RFIs); reviewing construction submittals and shop drawings; performing construction inspections and preparing field observation reports; advising the project officer regarding deficiencies and actions required or recommended; preparing supplementary drawings or revision drawings; managing document versions and revisions; reviewing contract modification proposals; and, reviewing contractor progress payment requests.<br /><br />d. Post-Construction Contract Services: reviewing, assessing, and confirming that building systems and equipment have been installed and operate in accordance with commissioning requirements; reviewing operation and maintenance manuals for completeness; preparing conformed-set drawings; preparing record drawings and as-built drawings; issuing certificates of completion (often required to be prepared and signed by a registered professional engineer); provide certification that fire protection systems are correctly installed and operational, providing training on proper operation, maintenance of equipment, support for building automation, and systems troubleshooting.<br /><br />e. Integrate Sustainable Features: To the maximum extent possible these scope items shall integrate or include sustainability features that will reduce the energy usage, water usage, reduce emissions, divert solid waste, reduce consumption of toxic materials and chemicals, increase organic waste diversion, ensure retrofitting and renovation promotes building's long term viability, and other sustainable enhancements.</p>
<p>We estimate there will be 8 - 12 task orders during the first year with the most common cost magnitude per task order ranging from $10k - $250k. The A-E firm selected must be able to provide the full scope of required services listed above. However,&nbsp;Evaluation, Assessment, and Planning Services and Design Services will likely be utilized the most frequently.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A-E Qualifications Submission Form and Format<br /></span></strong>Interested firms must prepare and submit an original plus five (5) copies (identified as such on the face of each) of a recently completed <strong>Standard Form (SF) 330 (Parts I and II), Architect-Engineer Qualifications</strong> pursuant to the instructions contained on the SF330, to the Contracting Officer no later than November 29, 2011. Required copies of SF330 may be photocopies of the original except for the copy number identification on the face of each. A fillable-PDF version of the SF330 is an attachment to this Notice. A link to download this form is visible on the right-hand side of the webpage where you are viewing this Notice.<br /><br /><strong>Address your submission as follows</strong>:<br /><br />SF330 - 12-161-SOL-00001<br />Attn: Contracting Officer<br />IHS Division of Engineering Services - Dallas<br />1301 Young Street, Suite 1071<br />Dallas, TX 75202-5433<br /><br />When completing the SF330, include information on the key team members who would be utilized for projects under this contract, incorporating relevant personnel of subconsultants and subcontractors. If partnering with another or multiple firms in a Joint-Venture, please submit a single SF330 for the entire team. <br /><br />You may submit supplementary information that assists to illustrate your firm's ability to meet the evaluation criteria listed below.

The Qualifications documents may be submitted in folders, binding combs or similar metal or plastic spiral bound booklets or in loose-leaf form bound using small paper binder clips. However, if the SF330 package is bound, do not use 2- or 3-ring loose leaf binders for this purpose.<br /><br /><strong>CAUTION:</strong> It is highly recommend that the actual SF330 be used for your submission, along with any necessary supplemental pages. If you do not use the SF330, your submission must follow the precise format and sequence of the SF330 to facilitate evaluation. SUBMISSIONS THAT DO NOT STRICTLY FOLLOW THE FORMAT OF THE SF330 MAY BE DETERMINED AS NON-RESPONSIVE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS NOTICE AND NOT EVALUATED FURTHER.<br /><br />IHS may create a shortlist of A-E respondents based on the initial evaluation results. Respondents selected for this second evaluation phase would be required to attend a face-to- face interview with the Source Selection Board members.

Examples include, but are not limited to:<br /><br />&bull; Experience working with small communities;<br />&bull; Experience assisting clients in complying with federal environmental protection rules and laws associated with the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA);<br />&bull; Experience working in Indian Country or with Indian tribes;<br />&bull; Experience working with LEED or other environmentally sustainable design principles and standards (such as ASHRAE 189.1).<br />&bull; Familiarity with the unique fiduciary responsibilities held by the federal government.<br />&bull; Experience working with federal agencies.<br /><br />&gt; <strong>Past Performance</strong> - Past performance on similar contracts with government agencies, tribal agencies, and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. Past performance documentation should, at a minimum, include a list of five (5) comparable projects. Limit the number of projects&nbsp;listed to ten (10) total. Each listed project should include the following.<br /><br />&bull; Owner<br />&bull; Owner contact information<br />&bull; Brief project description<br />&bull; Cost of the project<br /><br />&gt; <strong>Capacity to Accomplish the Work / Stability of Firm</strong> - Demonstrate the project team's capacity to perform and respond to a varying and uncertain workload in a timely manner. Identify firm's capacity to allocate additional resources as needed. Identify the project team leader(s) for whom the delivery orders will be assigned, and identify at least one secondary individual for whom the day-to-day responsibilities would fall to as a backup. Provide an overview of the stability/solvency of the firm and explain how it has grown or contracted over the past 5 and 10 year periods or since inception if less than these periods.<br /><br /><strong>* <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IMPORTANT NOTICE</span></strong>: In formulating the Qualifications submission, potential respondents should consider that FAR 52.219-14, which will be incorporated into any resultant contract, requires the Prime Contractor to perform services under the contract equivalent to 50% or more of the contract value in personnel costs throughout the life of the contract. This is a positive requirement rather than one where an indication of capacity, capability or willingness to meet these requirements would be acceptable. Respondents should demonstrate in their Qualifications submission how they will meet this requirement. Although the specific project effort awarded under any resultant contract is not known at this time, it is believed to be unlikely a Respondent could reasonably expect to meet this FAR requirement where they propose a Prime Contractor role limited to a single discipline, or possibly even multiple disciplines, where the discipline mix proposed leans towards disciplines typically not heavily utilized in A-E Services for medical facilities.</p>

PLEASE REFER TO AMENDMENT FOR DETAILS. **<br /><br />* THE SOLICITATION HAS BEEN POSTED. PLEASE REFER TO THIS DOCUMENT FOR SITE VISIT DATE/TIME AND PROPOSAL DUE DATE. *<br /><br />The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services for the U.S. Embassy Tegucigalpa, Honduras. The U.S. Embassy Tegucigalpa requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The estimated number of annual hours for guard services at this location is approximately 289,600 hours. The Contractor shall be required to provide services that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel; dependents; property; destruction of assets; prevent unauthorized access; and, deter potential terrorist attacks. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. The Government plans to post the solicitation on this site mid-April 2011. No paper copies will be mailed. The Government will solicit this requirement for full and open competition, using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: The synopsis will be posted for approximately 30 days. Then the solicitation will be posted and the Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period begins. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately 60 days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change and Offerors will be notified by registering on https://www.fbo.gov. Site Visit attendance is not mandatory, but highly encouraged. A site visit is expected to be scheduled approximately three weeks after the solicitation is posted. Offerors are responsible for entry visa (if required); all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations in both locations. Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the conference and site visit. No questions will be answered concerning this requirement until the solicitation is posted. Once the solicitation is posted, questions may be submitted by email to the Bonnie Allen at allenbj@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. Section 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the lowest price, technically acceptable proposal.

<DESC>Description: The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Philadelphia District, intends to initiate a Request for Quote (RFQ) procurement action and award a firm fixed price Purchase Order to one contractor for steel plate repairs in designated areas on the Dredge MCFARLAND. The work will consist of:<br /><br />1. Replacing steel deck plating:<br /><br />a. Directly underneath both the Port and Starboard drag winch drums [estimated size 6' x 10'<br />b. On Starboard Boat Deck [estimated 6' x 4']<br />c. On Port Boat Deck [4' x 10' in total]<br /><br />2. Replace curved bulkhead plating<br /><br />a. On Starboard Upper Deck Aft [3' x 4']<br /><br />The intent is to start the replacement of the winch room deck plating on 31 October 2011. This deck plating shall be replaced within 14 calendar days of the Notice to Proceed. The other plating shall be replaced starting on a mutually agreed to date in&nbsp;December 2011 or January 2012&nbsp;and be completed 21 calendar days of the Notice to Proceed for the line item.<br /><br />The acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 12, Commercial Items, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The Government will award a Firm Fixed-Purchase Order resulting from this solicitation to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote. An award is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable quote with the lowest price. The Government may elect to conduct discussions with offerors whose quotes are technically acceptable (or which may be expected to be made acceptable through clarification without revision). The Government reserves the right, however, to award a contract based on initial offers without conducting discussions. Therefore, each quote should be submitted from the offeror's most favorable technical and price standpoints.<br /><br />Quotes will be reviewed for completeness and evaluated for acceptability against the evaluation factors: Past Experience, Qualification/Certification, Past Performance, and Price. Price is more important than non-cost factors, however, non-cost factors are still significant to award.<br /><br />Solicitation number W912BU-12-T-0001 will be issued on or about 9 October 2011 with responses due by 04:00PM 14 OCT 2011. The period of performance will be as directed for the designated area, and contractors can expect an approximately two week period between the first NTP and the second NTP, but all work is expected to be completed by 10 JAN 2012. The preferred method of response to this solicitation is electronic. The only electronic method of accepting quotes will be via e-mail; no facsimile submissions are authorized. Instructions for submission will be included in the solicitation. Quotations submitted by other than electronic means should be marked "DO NOT open in mailroom" and delivered to the Edward A. Boddie, Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District, Contracting Division, Wanamaker Building, Room 643, 100 Penn Square East, Philadelphia, PA 19107-3390, REF: W912BU-11-T-0001.<br /><br />The NAICS CODE IS 336611 Ship Building and Repairing (SIC 7692 Welding Repair) and the size standard is 500 employees Solicitation documents and scope of work will only be available via the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) homepage located at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<DESC><p>This document sets forth the justification and approval for an exception to full and open competition allowed under the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) and FAR 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." This is a sole source acquisition to continue the protective force support services provided by WSI under contract number DE-AC52-06NA14390, which expires on September 30, 2011.</p>
<p>This proposed modification bridges the existing contract to a new competitively awarded 5-year contract being solicited under Request for Proposal number DE-SOL-0002014. The solicitation for the follow-on contract was issued on June 11, 2011, with proposals received on July 28, 2011 and which are currently being evaluated. While sufficient time was allotted to execute the follow-on contract, various unanticipated delays over the past two years during the acquisition planning process and solicitation phase have resulted in insufficient time available to award the follow-on prior to expiration of the current contract. The projected award date for the follow-on contract is on or about November 30, 2011.</p>
<p>The proposed bridge modification with incumbent WSI consists of a two-month base period with a one-month option period to cover any unforeseen circumstances potentially delaying the follow-on award, such as processing security clearances for the successful offeror. The execution of the bridge modification will prevent an adverse impact to the mission of the agency, which would occur with the interruption/ disruption of the work presently performed. The statement of work under the bridge modification is to remain substantially the same as under the current contract.</p>
