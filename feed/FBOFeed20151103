<DESC>DLA Aviation, Richmond proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) to add 21 national stock numbers (NSNs) on the Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (97499) corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9417, a long-term sole source contract which includes multiple NSNs to support various weapon systems. These items are being added to the Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (BHTI) (97499) Legacy corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9417, in accordance with the initially approved J&amp;A; however, the NSNs identified herein were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort. The pricing for the national stock numbers will be for option Years 4 and 5 of the contract. The contract expiration date is 22 February 2017. The contract requires a supply of parts with agreed to terms of FOB origin and inspection/acceptance at origin to DLA Direct stock locations. A total of 21 NSNs are targeted for this contract effort. It is anticipated that the total 21 NSNs will be priced for the award. The proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., CAGE 97499.
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><br />It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if a non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. These items have been identified as sole source; however, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites must provide their equivalent surplus clause, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. DLA will consider all such responses and may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the government. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by Tuesday, November 17, 2015.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (<a href="mailto:anne.mastrincola@dla.mil">anne.mastrincola@dla.mil</a>).<br /><br /><br />Additionally, letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 15 effort. The attached 21 NSNs have been identified for the current procurement. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately. The Letter RFP issue date is Wednesday, November 18, 2015. The anticipated closing date is Friday, December 18, 2015.<br />&nbsp;</p>

The purpose of this contract is to acquire specialized system and software engineering and development and system and software assurance services.  These services are performed on selected systems being developed by or for NASA, other Federal, State and local government agencies, commercial entities and/or other organizations and institutions as directed by the Government.  These services can include work on classified information systems. <p> NASA is not requesting proposals at this time.

<p>SUBJECT: NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE SERVICE AND REPAIRS OF PHILIPS GEMINI TF 16-SLICE PET/CT SCANNER</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a Sole Source basis, with PHILIPS HEALTHCARE, A DIVISION OF PENAC OF BOTHELL, WASHINGTON for the service and repair of a Philips Gemini TF 16-slice PET/CT Scanner under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106(1)(b).</p>
<p>The Philips Gemini TF 16-slice PET-CT scanner system has recently developed an issue with its patient transport system and requires repairs. Because the system cannot operate without this component, all research activities are halted until repairs can be performed.</p>
<p>Performing the work will require access to the Philips software components of the scanner system that are proprietary to the manufacturer. The software license agreement for these components prohibits access to them by anyone other than NIST or Philips employees. Because the system cannot be diagnosed (prior to repair) or re-calibrated (post-repair) without access to the software, this work can only be performed by a Philips service engineer. Therefore, only one source (Philips) is qualified to work on this equipment. PHILIPS HEALTHCARE does not have authorized third parties to service its equipment.</p>
<p>This requirement is expected to be awarded in December, 2015.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811219- Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance and the size standard is $20,500,000.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 4:00 PM EST (Noon) on Wednesday November 18, 2015. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Harry.Brubaker@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<CONTACT>Ricardo Elias 4073804101
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to award two modifications to a delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N61340-12-G-0001 to L-3 Communications Corporation, Link Simulation and Training Division (L-3) Company for the procurement of Software Configuration Set/Operational Flight Program (SCS/OFP) software for installation on all F/A-18 C/D Tactical Operational Flight Trainers (TOFTs) and SimuStrike devices as well as Deficiency Report (DR) corrections as a result of previous SCS/OFP Government testing.  The effort is a continuation of the current 25X -29C SCS/OFP effort that was previously awarded to L-3 and will now include requirements through 31C SCS/OFP.
  As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the F/A-18 C/D TOFT SCS/OFP software, L-3 is the only source capable of providing the SCS/OFP software.  

Award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling F/A-18 mission training requirements.  This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).  No solicitation documents are available.
 This notice of intent is neither a request for competitive proposals nor a solicitation of offers.  Matters pertaining to this notification may be directed to Ricardo Elias at 407-380-4101 or via email at Ricardo.L.Elias@navy.mil.

engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the
Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the
intended application. Interested parties may obtain copies of Military and
Federal Specifications and Standards, Qualified Products Lists (QPLs), Qualified
Product Databases (QPDs), Military Handbooks, and other standardized documents

supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate
with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources
may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or
submit proposals, quotations or capability statements. This notice of intent is
not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within
45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement
(BOA) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the
Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed
contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of
the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the
purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based upon
market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part
12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described
supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the

Government intends to negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may
identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit
quotes. Quotes received prior to the award date will be considered by the
Government.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed
contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of
the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the
purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The rights
to use the data needed to purchase this part from additional source(s) are not
owned by the Government and cannot be purchased, developed, or otherwise
obtained. It is uneconomical to reverse engineer this part. The subject item
requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is
flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined
adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the
source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been
solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that
an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an
approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information
detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source
Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx
Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data
required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your
offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source
approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source
Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the
Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this
solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted
hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the
ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award
of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP
WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at:

The purpose of this activity is to intensify malaria control and elimination activities by providing technical assistance and support to National Center for Parasitology, Entomology, and Malaria Control (CNM) to further develop, refine, and evaluate an evidence-based Model Elimination Package for malaria in Sampov Loun, which can then be implemented in other appropriate Operation Districts (ODs). Initial work on this package has already begun under the existing Greater Mekong Subregion Control and Prevention of Malaria (CAP-Malaria) Project. This regional project has been implemented in Burma, Thailand and Cambodia by University Research Co, LLC (URC) under cooperative agreement number AID-486-A-12-00001 which will be ending in October 2016. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

It is recognized that several factors may impede progress towards malaria elimination, including intensifying resistance to ACTs, waning finances for malaria elimination activities, and social and economic factors that are beyond the control of this Project. Nonetheless, the tools, approaches and the strengthened surveillance systems developed through this Project will enable Cambodia to move closer to the goal of elimination and equip CNM and partners to move quickly to address such challenges as they arise.</span></p>

<CONTACT>Martin L. Harris, Phone (217) 492-5041, Fax (217) 492-5046, Email martin.harris@gsa.gov
<DESC>The following work will be performed at the Jeffersonville Federal Center, Building 62 Jeffersonville, Indiana.  The project includes, but is not limited to the following work:  adding one new Deaerator (DA) tank and the associated pipes, controls and structural work. The new DA tank is larger than the current DA tank and the surrounding structure will need to be altered to accommodate the new DA tank.  The current window system will need to be removed to extract the current DA tank. A temporary system will be put in place until the new DA tank is installed at which time the old window system will be reinstalled.  The existing steel grate mezzanine opening and steel beam framing will be enlarged due to the increased size of the new DA tank.  Revisions to the existing steam and condensate piping are required due to the configuration and size of the new DA tank. Existing pipes will be removed to a logical point of removal and replaced with new pipes and valves as required to complete the installation of the new tank.  A new soft water supply line is to be extended to the existing condensate receiver and a new level transmitter installed to insure that the level in the tank is maintained above a minimum setting. The controls supplied with the DA tank will maintain the level in the DA tank by interfacing with the existing condensate return pumps and the soft water make-up solenoid valve.
<p>The estimated price range for all work is between $250,000 and $500,000.  There will also be two options included with this solicitation, that may or may not be exercised.  The North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 238220 with a size standard of $36.5 million.  This is a negotiated procurement, therefore, a public bid opening will not be held.  The solicitation will be available on or about November 19, 2015.  This solicitation will be a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set-aside in accordance with FAR Part 19.</p>

Space must be located in a quality building in a primecommercial office district with attractive, prestigious,&nbsp;professional surroundings with a prevalence of modern design and/or tasteful rehabilitation in modern use. Multi-use flex space and space in light industrial park settings will not be considered to meet these standards. Streets and public sidewalks must be well maintained.
<p>To allow for visibility to the public, the government office space shall be located not more than the equivalent of two city blocks from a primary or secondary street serving the office. The lessor shall provide acceptable signage from the primary or secondary street at no separate cost. The route from the primary or secondary street shall be direct. Locations which have obscure, difficult access or which require multiple turns<br />shall not be considered.</p>
<p>The location should not be located within the immediate&nbsp;vicinity of railroad tracks. Sites which are located directly on or near a roadway which presents a hazard to our customers will not be considered.<br /><br />Determinations of hazardous access will be determined by the Government. Examples of such sites include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Sites located directly on a highway or six lane&nbsp;thoroughfare if:<br />&bull; Ease of access to and availability of public transportation and parking for visitors and employees.<br />&bull; Sites which are located directly on a highway or six lane thoroughfare shall not be considered in the following<br />instances:<br />o If the two directions of traffic are separated by a&nbsp;physical barrier or traffic indicator which does not permit access from either direction within one block, or&#894;<br />o If the access is directly from the highway, unless there&nbsp;is a traffic control device within two blocks or equivalent from the proposed office space.<br />o There are no pedestrian sidewalks that allow easy&nbsp;access to and from the office.</p>
<p>Access from outside to agency space within the building must provide access for wheelchair traffic. The primary entrance must be accessible for all persons with special needs. Street level contiguous (same floor) space is preferred. Contiguous upper floor space on one floor that meets the Government lease criteria and has handicapped accessible elevator service to the government office floor is an acceptable alternative. We prefer that the storage and/or Interactive Video Tele-training (IVT) rooms be located contiguous with the main office space. However, these rooms only, and their associated square footage, may be separated from the main office area by a public corridor. Elevator service shall consist of a minimum of&nbsp;two accessible elevators that serve the floor proposed for the government. One of the accessible elevators may serve as a freight elevator.</p>
<p>It is a requirement that overall dimensions of the space shall have a maximum length to width ratio of 2 to 1. Preference will be given to blocks of space that allow maximum flexibility for furniture placement, i.e., few or no columns or other obstructions, rectangular in shape, no curves or offsets, and with large open areas. Space requiring ramps inside the office will not be acceptable. Columns must be at least 20 feet from any interior wall and from each other (clear distance) and be no more than 2 feet square.</p>
<p>The Government requires sufficient general parking as specified by local code requirements. The Government requests that, due to budgetary costs, the cost of this parking be included as part of the rental consideration. In some instances, the Government will request parking for carpools, disabled employees, and in and out parking for employee use and for program purposes.</p>
<p>The parking-to-square-foot ratio available on site shall at least meet current local code requirements, or, in absence of a local code requirement, on site parking shall be available at a ratio of 1 space for every 200 RSF of Government demised area.</p>
<p>When the Government is the only building tenant and/or the only tenant utilizing the parking lot, additional accessible parking spaces for the disabled beyond those otherwise required or existing, (whichever is greater) shall be provided based on the size of the office. This shall be in addition to any reserved parking required by the Government for employees with disabilities.</p>
<p>When the government is to be located in a multi tenant&nbsp;building in a downtown location, parking for the disabled shall be provided:<br /><br />(1) In an adjoining parking lot or garage with a fully accessible route to the office. Quantity shall be five spaces in addition to existing disabled parking provided or in addition to disabled spaces required by code, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>(2) Along city streets, by having the city provide a minimum number of disabled spaces, in addition to any existing or otherwise planned or required spaces within 1/2 block from the accessible entrance (see schedule above). Written assurance by the city shall be requested indicating that the spaces shall be restricted for usage by the disabled during the tenancy of the Government.</p>
<p>When public transportation is available, passenger stops must be within two blocks of the space. In suburban areas, in small communities and in areas of major cities where adequate public transportation and on site parking are not available, secure vehicle parking facilities MUST be available at reasonable commercial rates for visitors and employees within a two block radius of the space. Secure parking is defined as parking that meets Federal Protective Service guidelines and should be resolved before any lease is signed. "Reasonable Rates" will be determined by local pricing levels.</p>
<p>In those locations where on site parking is not available parking for the disabled must be located within the same&nbsp;block.</p>
<p>Restricted or metered parking of one hour or less within the two block area of the space does not meet parking&nbsp;requirements. This is because many Government contacts with the public cannot be completed within one hour.</p>

PRE-APPROVAL OF EYEGLASS FRAMES: Only pre-approved frames can be offered in response to the solicitation.  Commencing with the date of release of the Pre-solicitation notice published in fbo.gov, any potential Offeror may provide a frame selection chart to the Contract Specialist at the address identified below.  The frame chart provided for pre-approval must arrive no later than two (2) weeks prior to the solicitation closing date (to be established at the time of release of the solicitation).  From the frame chart provided the VA will select up to 100 frames that will be approved to be included in the Offer's approved sample kit.  

The chart shall include, but is not limited to, specifications of all frames, pictures and information about each frame. For each frame proposed, specify the name of manufacturer, frame style name, material classification, sizes, Colors, department (men's, women's, etc.) and name of distributor. No discontinued models or special "Medicaid" frames shall be permitted.  A minimum of 150 to 200 frame styles (not including color selection) shall be submitted for selection.  The submitted frame chart must clearly indicate which frames are mens, womens, unisex, and safety.  Deluxe frames should also be clearly identified from the standard frames in all categories.  

Frames with spring hinges, various bridge sizes and styles (saddle bridge, keyhole bridge, silicon nose pads), plus different temple lengths must be included. Deluxe Frames refers to eyeglass frames with features that make them more durable than standard frames.

Frames must be manufactured by at least four (4) different companies.

The chart submitted must identify the Offeror only on the outside of the package or envelope used to transmit the chart so that the chart itself is a "blind" chart in that it can contain no identification of the Offeror.  Only the Contract Specialist will know the identity of the Offeror who submitted the chart.  The Contract Specialist will assign a color code to identify the chart and will provide the color coded chart to a selection committee that includes experienced Opticians, Optometrist and Prosthetic Representatives who will evaluate all frame styles.  The committee will select up to 100 frames for inclusion in each color's approved sample kit. A final sample kit may include frames for approximately forty (40) different frame types for men, thirty (30) different frame types for women, twenty-five (25) unisex frames and five (5) safety frames.  At least 5 frames for both men and women must be deluxe frames.  The selection committee will provide each color's approved sample kit to the Contract Specialist and the Contract Specialist shall notify each Offeror of their approved sample kit.  The Offeror must base their pricing on their approved sample kit.  

If the selection committee cannot select sufficient frames to make up an approved sample kit the Offeror will be notified and will be provided an opportunity to provide additional frames for evaluation.  If the committee cannot identify sufficient frames to make up an approved sample kit the Offeror may be determined to be non-responsive.

<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>In 1997, Congress established the Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) as a response to the diabetes epidemic among American Indians and Alaska Natives. The Northwest Tribes recognized a need for technical assistance with diabetes data, and The Western Tribal Diabetes Projects (WTDP) has been established to support the need. WTDP assists tribal programs in tracking and reporting accurate health data. This information is used to improve the quality of patient care, to gain additional resources, and to plan effective intervention programs.</p>
<p>To respond effectively to the needs of the Northwest Tribes, the WTDP goals are to:<br />&bull; Provide culturally-appropriate training and technical assistance to I/T/U health care programs using diabetes-specific tools and the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) and NextGen.<br />&bull; Continue to refine and provide effective and innovative diabetes project tools.<br />&bull; Build partnerships and collaboration for expansion of resources and services to tribal diabetes programs.<br />&bull; Demonstrate and provide culturally appropriate training to tribal programs on various Best Practices and topics, such as: tobacco cessation, nutrition, physical activity, eye exams, motivational interviewing, Healthy Heart and Diabetes Prevention Program curricula, traditional foods/gardens, and motivational interviewing</p>

<CONTACT>Michael R. Woody, Phone 2158977211, Email michael.woody1@navy.mil
<DESC><p><br />Notice Type: Sources Sought</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</p>
<p>N64498-15-RFI-5153</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NOTICE is being issued by the Department of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Philadelphia Division (NSWCPD). NSWCPD has a requirement to procure hardware items in support of Navigation and Ship Control Systems currently installed on the following multiple classes: CVN; MCM, LSD; LPD; LHA; and LHD. It is the Government's intention to procure these hardware items, utilizing other than full and open competition, from Rocky Research IAW FAR 6.302-1, as only Rock Research meet the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Rocky Research hardware is required to ensure continued operational capability of numerous critical systems aboard aircraft carriers and other surface combatants. Rocky Research, as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), is the sole designer and fabricator of this equipment, and, as such, is the only contractor with the complete technical data necessary to furnish the required hardware. No other firm possesses the prerequisite technical data as this information is proprietary to Rocky Research. The Government does not possess full legal rights to the technical data. Only Rocky Research possesses full legal rights to this information. Based on above, Rocky Research is the only contractor which qualifies to perform the efforts associated with the specifications under this requirement.</p>
<p>Rocky Research is not willing to sell complete technical data and software source codes to the Government since most of the equipment has been developed for the Navy by modifying Commercial-Off-The-Shelf hardware.</p>
<p>Access to this information is required to continue the support of the Rocky Research equipment currently in use on highly critical Navigation and Ship Control systems installed in the fleet.</p>
<p>Without direct access to Rocky Research for their hardware and engineering knowledge, there is a high risk that the currently installed systems will suffer from inadequate support and eventual failure. Serious issues, such as the inaccurate targeting of combat systems equipment and the safety of navigation with regards to steering control, could arise if the necessary support was not in place.</p>
<p>Certification efforts have been completed using the Rocky Research hardware specified. Including Combat Systems Integration, Steering Control and Navigation Qualifications. Modifying the hardware that has already been certified will cause recertification efforts to occur, costing the Navy approximately $3,000,000 in total potential requalification efforts. This cost impact is related to the additional funding required to procure and test new hardware equipment, as well as accounting for the amount of labor expended to develop and qualify the associated systems and components. It is estimated that the time required for another vendor to produce products that meet the required certifications is 36 months, which is unacceptable to meet U.S. Navy ship installation schedules.</p>
<p>. NSWCPD intends to issue a solicitation to the specified vendor to meet mission requirements. Prior to issuing a brand name only solicitation, NSWCPD is requesting information in order to make an informed determination regarding procurement strategy. A copy of the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) is attached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES: Responses shall include specific details regarding the ability to provide the required hardware items to meet the needs of the Government. Responses shall discuss how your product/service will meet the requirements found in the SOW.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responses are not to exceed more than 10 pages. Responses shall be in electronic format. A cover page for the response shall be included. The cover page shall include the company name, address, CAGE Code, Business Size Status for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of this RFI and points of contract (names, email, and telephone numbers) at a minimum. The cover page is not considered in the total page count.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NSWCPD will accept only electronic unclassified submission of responses. Responses shall be sent to Michael Woody at michael.woody1@navy.mil with the subject line " RFI N64498-15-R-5153" All responses shall be unclassified and submitted by no later than 18:00 on 10 November 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This RFI is for market research purposes only and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). This notice shall not be construed as a contract, a promise to contract, or as a commitment of any kind by the Government. The Government is NOT seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. This RFI Notice is issued solely for conducting market research in accordance with FAR Part 10 and gathering information for planning purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this RFI, and the Government will not compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing the response to this RFI. The Government will not release any information marked with a proprietary legend received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is conducting a market survey for repairs to the north jetty feature of the Federal project in Hampton Harbor, New Hampshire. This announcement is to determine the interest, availability and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Small Business concerns as described below. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The project is planned to be issued on or about December 2015. The construction window is September 15, 2016 through March 31, 2017. The contract completion is March 31, 2017. The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The work of this project consists of repairing several sections of the north jetty feature of the Federal navigation project at Hampton Harbor, Hampton NH. The north jetty was damaged during Hurricane Sandy and subsequent storms. Approximately 2,220 tons of armor stone will be required to make repairs to 4 identified work areas of the jetty. The stones will vary in size from 3-4 tons and 6-10 tons. The work includes removing, replacing and reworking existing armor stone as well as acquiring and placing new armor and core stone along the jetty. The repaired areas must be properly interlocked and be within specified design tolerances. The crest width of the north jetty is 5 feet for about the first 500 feet (starting from land), widening to 8 feet for the next 300 feet, and widening to 10 feet for the most seaward 200 feet of the jetty. Due to shallow water depths adjacent to the landward end of the jetty, work at this end may be performed from land. Due to narrow crest widths of the landward end of the jetty, the remainder of the work requires performance by marine based plant. Protection of piping plovers and their habitat limits construction to the period of September 1 to March 31. A storage/staging area at the southern end of the Hampton Beach State Park (HBSP) has been requested and is expected to be available from September 15, 2016 to March 31, 2017. An access way from the HBSP parking lot to the landward end of the north jetty for the delivery of stone to the landward end of the jetty has been requested and is expected to be available from September 15, 2016 to March 31, 2017. Construction mats will be required to be laid upon the access way. Access to the boat ramp at the Hampton State Pier will be available only for the launching of small work vessels.</p>
<p>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following: business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) and what type of equipment the firm is proposing to use. Firms must submit documented information that demonstrates experience with a minimum of two examples of construction projects, similar in scope and magnitude to this project that the firm has successfully performed in the last five years. The examples must clearly demonstrate breakwater or jetty repair projects (or other stone work in a marine environment) beyond typical earthwork construction and demonstrate experience with acquiring and placing large armor stones (up to 10 tons) with both land and marine equipment; the ability and capability of simultaneously performing this work by land and barge; and demonstrate experience in working in a dynamic and restricted marine environment (ocean waves, tides, time of year, etc.). Responses should include experience of Foreman and Crane Operators working on stone structures. Please indicate your team subcontractors that will be used to support your effort and include their prior experience and qualifications. Proof of bonding capability is required. Responses are due November 24, 2015. Responses should provide one electronic CD format and one hard copy. Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN: Mr. Stephen Jones Responses are limited to twenty pages. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided. This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation. The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.</p>

4.	DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:

Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a common, non-invasive treatment for kidney stones.  Kidney stones are solid pieces of material that form from dietary elements found in urine.  Larger kidney stones may cause painful ureteral obstruction for patients as they move through the ureter.  A kidney stone that manages to become lodged in a patient's ureter may prevent drainage of urine from the kidney that causes swelling (hydronephrosis) that could lead to kidney damage.  

ESWL is the most common type of lithotripsy.  ESWL utilizes focused, high intensity acoustic pulses to treat kidney stones.  These acoustic pulses break kidney stones into small enough pieces so that patients may pass them without discomfort.  The duration of an average procedure is approximately one hour.  Procedures with ESWL do involve patients receiving anesthesia.  Patients are generally able to return home the same day as their procedure.

The C.W. Bill Young VAMC has a requirement to procure a contract for the services of a transportable ESWL system (inclusive of Shock Wave Lithotripsy Unit, Treatment Table, X-Ray C-Arm, ESWL Workstation and Display Monitors, Licensed Radiological Technologists for Diagnostic Radiographic/X-Ray; Any and all ESWL Equipment/Materials Necessary for Procedures).   

 A State Licensed radiologic technologist who is licensed in diagnostic radiography/X-ray is also required.

<CONTACT>Nancy Lamon-Kritikos, Phone 3014156844, Email Nancy.Lamon-Kritikos@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole-source contract with American Science &amp; Engineering (AS&amp;E) for maintenance of NRC-owned AS&amp;E X-ray machines. The period of performance for this requirement is five years, including one base year and four option years.
<p><br />The NRC requires continuation of maintenance services for thirteen AS&amp;E Micro-Dose X-ray inspection systems, which include the Z backscatter technology. These X-ray machines are used by the NRC at Headquarters, Regional and other NRC facilities to screen packages and incoming mail. Maintenance services are currently being provided by AS&amp;E under NRC-HQ-12-P-10-0143 and NRC-10-10-427. Services include comprehensive preventative and corrective maintenance, including all parts and labor, consumables and X-ray tube disposal, for NRC-owned AS&amp;E X-ray machines.</p>
<p>The AS&amp;E Gemini parcel x-ray inspection system, with the Z Backscatter technology, is only manufactured by and can only be maintained by AS&amp;E. Proprietary systems information, schematics and parts are only available to AS&amp;E's service technicians. Therefore, AS&amp;E is the only source that can meet NRC requirement for maintenance of NRC-owned AS&amp;E X-ray machines.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals. Request for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services.<br /><br />Statutory Authority: 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

<DESC>RFI-AFSOC-16-01 (28 Oct 2015)
<p>PRIVACY ACT STATEMENT: This page may contain Privacy Act Information. The Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, requires that federal agencies inform individuals at the time information is solicited from them. Failure to provide Personally Identifiable Information (PII) may limit the efficient performance of ADNI-CIO administrative/management responsibilities.</p>
<p>I. Introduction: This is a Request For Information (RFI) ONLY from Headquarters Air Force Special Operations Command (HQ AFSOC) at Hurlburt Field, FL. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. Interested firms shall not send proposals in response to this Notice. This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p>II. Background:<br />The Gap Analysis phase of the HQ AFSOC Strategic Planning Process (SPP) Capability-Based Assessment (CBA) produced the FY18-37 Prioritized Gap List (PGL) and provides the basis for a data call for potential solutions grounded in the DOTMLPF-P framework. Subsequent analysis of submitted solutions by technical and subject matter experts will be used to develop a way ahead recommendation for each PGL item.</p>
<p>III. Prioritized Gap List (PGL):<br />The FY18-37 PGL contains the Command's most enduring and critical capability gaps and each entry includes in depth detail to include: a gap description, background information, major components, and their attendant measures of merit. It is a classified document and is currently hosted in electronic form on a classified network. PGL access will be granted to solution providers contingent on their completion of the Submission guidance in Section IV below.</p>
<p>AFSOC's unclassified Areas of Interest (AOI) list is provided as a decision aid to potential solution providers prior to requesting a copy of the PGL.</p>
<p>IV. Submission Guidance:</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>a. Interested solution providers will submit a Notice of Interest (NOI) to HQ AFSOC/A8XZ. The unclassified NOI shall include a brief Vendor Capability Statement (limited to 10 pages in PDF format) to include the following:</p>
<p>1. Core Competencies<br />2. Key Personnel<br />3. Security POC<br />4. Company and Government Entity (CAGE) Code</p>
<p>b. In a separate, password protected document, solution providers may submit security cleared company representatives (limit to five personnel) requiring access to the PGL. Use this document to identify the following personally identifiable information (PII) for designated company representatives:</p>
<p>1. First Name<br />2. Last Name<br />3. SSAN (Needed to verify security clearances)<br />4. Classified Email Address<br />5. Telephone Number</p>
<p>NOTE: As an alternative to sending PII, companies may submit clearances via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) to the following Security Management Office (SMO) code: EE0VFJHM6. Please enter AFSOC/A8XZ Attn: PGL RFI within the POC block.</p>
<p>c. Providers will answer the following questions to allow AFSOC to determine the degree of foreign involvement/influence in the provider's company:</p>
<p>1. Is the company US owned and US operated?<br />2. Is the company US owned but foreign controlled?<br />3. Is the company US owned by foreign affiliated?<br />4. Is the company foreign owned and foreign affiliated?<br />5. Is the company a US subsidiary of a foreign company?</p>
<p>NOI unclassified email submittals: AFSOC.A8X.SP@us.af.mil<br />NOI classified email submittals: AFSOC.A8X.SP@socom.smil.mil<br />NOI normal mail submittals: HQ AFSOC/A8XZ<br />100 Bartley St, Suite 209W<br />Hurlburt Field, FL 32544-5434</p>
<p>d. For providers who have been previously approved to receive the PGL and wish to receive the latest updated version, confirm the following in writing from the security POC as an alternative to resubmittal of the NOI:<br />1) Changes in company core competencies, key personnel, or CAGE Code IAW item a above<br />2) Changes to cleared personnel requiring access to the PGL IAW item b above<br />3) Changes to the answers to the questions IAW item c above</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>a. Following a review of the NOI, the Government will notify solution providers of the results. Approved solution providers will be granted access to the PGL via one of two methods:</p>
<p>1. Classified email directly to one of the cleared company representatives identified in the company NOI.</p>
<p>2. Classified package (hard copy) delivered to a facility within the company cleared to receive, handle, and store classified materials. Receiving individual must have a valid security clearance, verified by AFSOC/A8X. Standard procedures for wrapping, mailing, and tracking classified materials apply.</p>
<p>NOTE: Unapproved solution providers or those providers that cannot meet at least one of the requirements above (a.1. or a.2.) will be dismissed from further participation in the AFSOC Strategic Planning Process.<br /><br />b. In addition to the PGL, the Government will provide a solution template to document solution submittals. A separate template must be used for each solution submittal and all submittals should be related to one or more items on the PGL. Discussions with any of the AFSOC points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposal. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to obligate the Government.<br />Current RFI Open Period:</p>
<p>This RFI will remain open until 29 February 2016 unless amended or superseded. All submissions will be accepted and receipt will be acknowledged. Follow-up requests for additional information on specific submittals will be initiated by the Government. The RFI may be reissued and/or amended periodically, as needed.</p>

<DESC>Introduction: The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, CCAP-SCN, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Joint Program Executive Office - Chemical Biological Defence, Joint Project Manager Protection (JPM P), intends to award a firm fixed price contract on a sole source basis to Air Techniques International, Inc.

<p>Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement listed. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs:</p>
<p>The Joint Services Mask Leakage Tester (JSMLT) is a portable device capable of determining serviceability, proper fit and identifying defective components of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) protective masks. This system combines all of these features in one unit, providing a capability currently not available in the battle space to quantitatively test protective masks for defects and to assess the fit of the mask on an individual. The JSMLT is inter-operable with all fielded masks and capable of testing many Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) masks. The JSMLT is currently in the Operations &amp; Support phase of the Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Life Cycle Management System and is fielded to, US Navy, US Marine Corps, US Coast Guard, and US Air Force. The government owned TDA-99B, is a non-portable version of the JSMLT and is used within the production facility for acceptance testing of field protective mask.</p>
<p>The proposed contract would fulfill the Government need for contractor-provided maintenance (cleaning, replacing parts); repairs (cleaning, overhaul, repairing to Condition Code A); calibration; changes to training material and technical manual; packaging, storage and transportation; modifications and software upgrades; configuration status accounting; higher quality contract requirements; warranty; and item unique identification and radio frequency identification requirements as well as options for spare parts and accessories production for the systems and associated logistics support services.</p>
<p>The table below identifies the testers by nomenclature, National Stock Number (NSN) and Part Number.</p>
<p>NOMENCLATURE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NSN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PART NUMBER<br />Joint Service Mask Leakage Tester&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6665-01-506-9002&nbsp; 9300156<br />Control Unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6130-01-537-6415&nbsp; 0200185<br />Power Unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6130-01-537-6417&nbsp; 0200305<br />TDA-99B Respirator Function Tester&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N/A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N/A</p>
<p>The contract will also include logistics support services, to include scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, overhaul, and calibration, procure repair parts and management, training material and operator manual updates and changes.</p>
<p>The Government believes that no other vendor besides Air Techniques International possesses the capability and the knowledge of the JSMLT's proprietary technology to perform the required maintenance, repair, calibration and other logistics support services.</p>

<DESC>Joint Project Manager Medical Countermeasure Systems (JPM MCS) Office Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Medical Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Medical Countermeasure Efforts under Procurement Contracts or Grants, and Prototypes under Other Transactions Agreements.<br /><br />The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) is organized into five Joint Project Management Offices (JPMO), each responsible for specific commodity areas. General information on the JPEO-CBD and subordinate JPMOs can be obtained from the JPEO-CBD website at http://www.jpeocbd.osd.mil/. The medical CBRN countermeasures developed by the Joint Project Manager Medical Countermeasure Systems (JPM MCS) office directly support the current, near-term, and far-term challenges by providing the capability to prevent, diagnose and treat the effects of chemical, radiological and biological warfare agents. Mission areas and technical points of contact for the product management offices within the JPM MCS are shown in Section VII of the BAA document. Proposals are sought from all eligible sources as specified herein, including educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) provides general information, proposal preparation instructions, evaluation and selection criteria, and award administration.
<p>The JPM MCS contemplates the award of procurement Contracts, Grants or Cooperative Agreements, and OTA's under this BAA in support of its mission to foster and/or conduct the advanced development of FDA-approved medical CBRN countermeasures. The purpose of this BAA is to identify the best available science, and as such, there are no set-asides associated with any awards resulting from this BAA due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas/elements of development in the cited areas of interest or to inapplicability.</p>
<p>Organizations are strongly encouraged to explore JPM MCS' interest by submitting a preliminary proposal (preproposal). Preproposals may be submitted at any time describing a specific idea or project that pertains to any of the advanced development areas of interest outlined in the BAA. Preproposals should be no longer than three pages, and include a description of the relevant technology including supporting data, the scope of the proposed effort including a high-level Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and a description of the proposer's research, development, manufacturing, past performance, or other special qualifications. The preproposal should include an anticipated cost for the efforts described in the preproposal. Preproposals and questions may be submitted to the following email address: usarmy.detrick.mcs.mbx.baa@mail.mil. Brochures or other descriptions of general organizational or individual capabilities will not be accepted as a preproposal. All preproposals will be assigned and an email will acknowledge receipt of a preproposal. Usually, the Project Manager of the submitting organization should receive a decision letter or email regarding the preproposal within 60-90 days of submission.</p>
<p>If the preproposal for a procurement contract is accepted, ACC-APG Natick Contracting Division will send the a Request For Full Proposal (RFFP) and any additional requirements, including suggested Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs), a Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL), clauses, terms, and conditions. Full proposals shall be submitted within 45 days after being requested. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject submissions received more than 45 days after the request for a full proposal from the U.S. Government. Receipt of full proposals will be acknowledged by email.</p>
<p>Organizations that submit a preproposal or "white paper" and are subsequently invited to submit a full proposal under the BAA for a Grant/Cooperative Agreement may be directed to submit through Grants.gov. Early planning with your organization will facilitate this process.</p>
<p>If a preproposal for the development of prototypes in accordance with Section 845 of Public Law (P.L.) 103-160, submitted in response to this Announcement is accepted by the U.S. Government, a Request for Full Proposal (RFFP) will be sent to the organization submitting the preproposal.</p>
<p>The type of instrument used to reflect the business relationship between the recipient and the U.S. Government will be determined by the Grants, Agreements, or Contracting Officer prior to award. The U.S. Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground Natick Contracting Division, Fort Detrick (ACC-APG Natick), which provides contracting support to JPM MCS, will process proposals selected for funding. Offerors may identify the type of instrument that they feel best suites the proposed effort. An Offeror's suggestion regarding suitable type of instrument does not obligate the government to employ the suggested instrument type.</p>
<p>Potential applicants are encouraged to discuss their proposal ideas with the JPM MCS technical contacts listed in Section VII Missions and BAA Areas of Interest. <br />Administrative questions concerning the preparation of preproposals or proposals should be addressed to U.S. Army Contracting Command Natick Contracting Division/ Agreements Officer. They should be emailed to usarmy.detrick.mcs.mbx.baa@mail.mil, ATTN: Natick Contracting Division - Fort Detrick, JPM MCS BAA15-01, or mailed to the following address:<br /><br />Medical Countermeasure Systems<br />ATTN: Natick Contracting Division - Fort Detrick /ACC-APG-NCD<br />110 Thomas Johnson Drive, Suite 240 <br />Frederick, MD 21702</p>

The availability of funds may limit the ability of the U.S. Government to make awards in specific areas, nevertheless preproposals are sought under this BAA announcement for areas consistent with the mission areas identified in Section VII of this announcement.<br /><br />From time to time, special announcements or calls for proposals referencing this BAA may be issued for specific requirements in addition to any requirements announced in section VIII itself.

The HQ-PMO is responsible for planning and executing the new FBI HQ project (in collaboration with the General Services Administration). This initiative will support the efforts to conduct market research on effective FF&amp;E solutions that can be tested and demonstrated in the current FBI space(s), and be incorporated into immediate or future FBI innovative workspace solutions.</p>
<p>All FF&amp;E experts interested in participating in this initiative must submit an information package clearly stating how their products fit the following but not limited criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; Culture - National Security Law Enforcement Organization<br />&bull; Agility - multi-functionality space/furniture<br />&bull; Choice - adjustability to different types of work areas, space types, space allocations, with different capabilities, different degrees of workstations (i.e., active vs. focused, multiple monitors, sit to stand workstations); open or enclosed workspaces; different types of finishes, and designs that works with the space design and our security guidelines<br />&bull; Collaboration - integration of media areas with active and focused work areas<br />&bull; Well-being - Promotes productivity (i.e. adjustable height workstations, ergonomic chairs, lighting); FF&amp;E that encourage movement and comfort <br />&bull; Innovation - New and creative design that works in synergy with the current/future space layout and maximizes its use while providing maximum functionality (i.e. mobile work areas, plug-in stations, flexible spaces)</p>
<p>These findings will support and ensure costs, sustainability, flexibility and synergy needed to maximize the equilibrium between the harmony of the well being of all FBI employees and their performance in the workspace.</p>
<p>DETAILS:</p>
<p>The FBI plans to consolidate its headquarters at one of three short-listed sites located in the National Capital Region. A consolidated FBI HQs is needed to support information sharing, collaboration, and integration of FBI strategic priorities.</p>
<p>In support of this project, the FBI is conducting market research on how the workplace will function and evolve in the 21st century and how its employees will work, interact, and collaborate in the office environment of the new FBI HQ. Changes in information technology, employee demographics, and corporate culture will dramatically alter expectations and uses of FBI workspaces in the coming decade.</p>
<p>The HQ-PMO is leading this initiative and will undertake a vendor demonstration project for FF&amp;E that will be used as market research to collect data on ways to maximize the design of workspaces and their functionality for the better of our employees and our mission.</p>
<p>The HQ-PMO currently occupies a 2,800-square foot office space in the J. Edgar Hoover Building. The FBI intends to enter into vendor demonstration agreements with multiple vendors to test a variety of FF&amp;E in the HQ-PMO space for potential application to the workspace design of the new FBI HQ. This market research will also serve as a "Lessons Learned" strategy that may be incorporated into more immediate build outs at FBI HQ, offsite, and field office locations.</p>
<p>DEMONSTRATION SPACE DETAILS:</p>
<p>The existing HQ-PMO will serve as the "Workspace Laboratory", the space is directly adjacent to the cafeteria in the J. Edgar Hoover Building and is thus the ideal location for an interactive Workspace Lab that will be informed by and contribute to culture change as the FBI transitions into its new HQ. The Workspace Lab has been designed to include a variety of workspaces that support and balance collaboration and focused work.</p>
<p>The population who will be collaborating in this Workspace Lab consists of various GS grade levels, top FBI Senior Executive Management, as well as visiting external Senior Management from our partnering agencies.</p>
<p>A layout of the Workspace Lab is provided in Attachment 1 and includes the following types of workspaces and finishes:</p>
<p>&bull; "Front Porch"/Reception Area that can <br />accommodate informal meetings and discussions<br />&bull; Large, reconfigurable conference room<br />&bull; Stand-up meeting/large document review area<br />&bull; Active workspaces<br />&bull; Focused workspaces<br />&bull; Active/focused workspaces<br />&bull; Huddle areas<br />&bull; Neutral interior wall colors, and carpeting with <br />a pop of accent colors</p>
<p>Additionally, the PMO anticipates that the Workspace Lab will be outfitted with audiovisual equipment, IT equipment, workspace-specific lighting, acoustic-enhancing features, and collaboration tools such as smart boards, white boards, and other visual displays.</p>
<p>The HQ-PMO plans on continually reconfiguring the Workspace Lab to demonstrate the agility and adaptability of the future workspace and to generate excitement and interest in the new FBI HQ. As a part of this demonstration, the FBI seeks vendors interested in demonstrating cutting-edge FF&amp;E in a variety of categories:</p>
<p>&bull; Seating - e.g., desk, conference room, huddle room, stand-up meeting area (stools), soft seating for reception areas <br />&bull; Workstations for active and focused work areas<br />&bull; Collaboration tables - e.g., collaborative conference room, reception area, stand-up meeting and large documents review areas<br />&bull; Lighting that enhances and reinforces the workspace type and allocation<br />&bull; Stand-alone huddle spaces/pods or private teaming spaces<br />&bull; Equipment that maximizes collaboration/engagement among groups of people and programs - e.g., concealed projection screens, retractable partitions, retractable/movable whiteboards, smartboards, audiovisual displays<br />&bull; Equipment that maximizes focused areas - e.g., noise cancelling, privacy, traffic management solutions<br />&bull; Storage solutions, both personal and shared (e.g. desk side, lockers, vertical storage solutions)<br />&bull; Finishes-colors and materials that complement the existing interior finishes to maximize adjustability and uniformity<br />&bull; Materials- Eco-friendly, ergonomic solutions</p>
<p>In addition to the categories listed above, the FBI is interested in other FF&amp;E that would support the goals and design principles of the Workspace Lab that the FBI has not previously considered.</p>
<p>All FF&amp;E must meet federal environmentally preferable purchasing requirements.</p>
<p>The FBI plans to permit multiple vendors to demonstrate FF&amp;E simultaneously and on a rotating basis. Per the results of the most recent demonstrations, all new accepted FF&amp;E will remain in place for demonstration purposes for up to eight (8) months.</p>
<p>WORKSPACE LAB GOALS:</p>
<p>The FBI is requesting information about FF&amp;E that demonstrates functionality in the following but not limited criteria:</p>
<p>1) Has the potential of improving employee productivity and collaboration<br />2) Enhances the workplace environment by promoting employee well-being<br />3) Provides for employee choice in workspaces and agility in reconfiguring workspaces as mission needs shifts<br />4) Demonstrates innovation that reflects changes in work preferences due to shifting demographics and technological advances<br />5) Attracts the interest of employees and facilitates a culture change in the way FBI employees view and conduct their mission and operations in the workplace of the 21st century</p>
<p>HOW TO SUBMIT RESPONSES:</p>
<p>All parties interested in participating in this RFI must follow the below instructions:</p>
<p>1) Submit an information package describing how the FF&amp;E proposed for demonstration fits the criteria of the Workspace Lab Goals<br />2) An explanation of the plans on how the technology advances will be incorporated into future FF&amp;E design (based on precedence)<br />3) A written statement agreeing in principle to the terms and conditions of the Vendor Demonstration Agreement (Attachment 2).</p>
<p>Responses may be in Word or PDF format and may include product specifications, photos, figures, etc. Responses must be e-mailed to the Contracting Officer at Nancy.beck@ic.fbi.gov Individual e-mail messages may not exceed 10 MB.</p>

Statement of Work (SOW)
Design and Content

1.0	Introduction (Provide a brief description of what you are buying).  
We need an imaged guided focal ERG (electroretinography) system to supplement our Micron III camera to selectively record retinal function in damaged parts of the retina.
This is required to continue our experiments which we are funded to do - that tests retinal structure and function in response to local gene therapy. Since we can only deliver gene therapy to a local part of the retina, we need to record focally to determine its action.
We already have the Micron III camera and would only need the focal ERG system to complement this project. 

2.0	Background (Provide any historical information necessary to understand how and why the requirement evolved and where it is headed.  Include appropriate information to help the reader/contractor understand the requirement).  
Electroretinography is a technique to analyze the function of the retina. It allows the recording of electrical information of the retina in response to light. However, not all areas are affected equally, so a technique such as image guided focal ERG would allow to record from damaged and healthy areas independently. 

3.0	Scope (Provide an overview of the PWS emphasizing the most important aspects of your requirement and defining the boundaries of the contractor's performance responsibilities).  
We need an imaged guided focal ERG (electroretinography) system to that mounts onto the existing Micron III camera that we already have in the lab to selectively record retinal function in damaged parts of the retina.
The contractor has to provide the imaged guided focal ERG (electroretinography) system and mount it onto the Micron III camera.

4.0	Applicable Directives (List all documents referenced in the next section 5.0, Performance Requirements, with which the contractor will have to comply in performance of the contract effort.  If only portions of a given document apply, specifically identify the applicable portions).  
No documents are necessary.

5.0	Performance Requirements (Identify what the contractor is required to do (major tasks and subtasks).  
The system has to perform as per the description of the imaged guided focal ERG (electroretinography) system from Phoenix. It has to provide electrical responses from the different parts of the eye; the output of the system has to be convertible into Excel format for data analysis. 

6.0	Deliverables (List all data required to manage or monitor contractor performance).  
The system has to be provided as a single delivery. I has to be installed by the provider so confirm operation.

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offerors specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVLAUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.<br /><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC-84)<br /><br />1352.215-72 INQUIRIES (APR 2010)<br /><br />Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the contract specialist within seven (7) days of the posting.  All responses to the questions will be made in writing, without identification of the questioner, and will be included in an amendment to the solicitation.  Even if provided in other form, only the question responses included in the amendment to the solicitation will govern performance of the contract. (end of provision)<br /><br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 332410 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is being set aside 100 percent for small businesses.<br /><br />In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the contractor shall be a small business under the applicable size standard and shall provide either its own product or that of another domestic small business manufacturing or processing concern. See FAR 19.102(f) for additional information.<br /><br />Background:<br /><br />The NIST Sensor Science Division is responsible for advancing the measurement sciences which includes temperature.  The Sensor Science Division has a need for sodium filled isothermal furnace liners (IFL) (heat pipes) for five fixed point furnaces in order to perform high temperature calibrations in support of the resistance thermometry, radiance temperature, and spectral radiance calibration services.  The current furnaces were built with Alloy 600/601 IFLs and they have failed after extended use above 1075 &deg;C.  These furnaces need the Haynes 230 Alloy IFL upgrade which was specifically developed for extended use above 1075 &deg;C which is required for operation at the gold fixed point temperature near 1064 &deg;C.<br /><br />The fixed point furnaces are used to calibrate standard platinum resistance temperatures, radiation thermometers, and radiance temperature lamps.  These furnaces need sodium filled isothermal furnace liners (IFL) (heat pipes), to ensure an isothermal zone that is required to support the uncertainties that are claimed by these five laboratories.<br /><br />The furnaces are a NIST design.  The six (6) required liners will be installed in the various furnaces by NIST staff.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />1352.201-70, CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (APRIL 2010) <br />The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APRIL 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

<p>November 19, 2015, through November 18, 2016.</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (OCT 2015), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (OCT 2014), applies to this acquisition. The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Additionally, FAR 52.203-98, Prohibition on Contracting with Entities that Require Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements - Representation (DEVIATION 2015-02), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(x) Offeror is to include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (NOV 2015), with its offer or acknowledge its listing in the System for Award Management (SAM) website.</p>
<p>(xi) The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (MAY 2015), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xii) The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (NOV 2015), applies to this acquisition. The Contracting Officer has indicated the following clauses listed in paragraph (b) as applicable and are hereby incorporated by reference: (4) 52.204-10, Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards (OCT 2015); (8) 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interest When Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment (OCT 2015); (25) 52.222-3, Convict Labor (JUN 2003); (27) 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (APR 2015); (28) 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity (APR 2015); (30) 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers With Disabilities (JUL 2014); (40) 52.223-18, Encouraging Contractor Policies to Ban Text Messaging While Driving (AUG 2011); and (50) 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management (JUL 2013).</p>
<p>(xiii) Brand Name Justification - The HHS Office of the Secretary, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (ASPA) is the HHS leader for the dissemination of health-related information and is responsible for managing several high-level social media channels that provide sensitive information to the public regarding the Secretary's Twitter and Facebook accounts, as well as several priority websites such as Flu.gov, Foodsafety.gov, and Mentalhealth.gov.</p>
<p>ASPA requires specific types of data to be available when engaging and monitoring social media accounts to determine the appropriate messaging of health-related information with the American public. In order to obtain this data, ASPA requires a social media monitoring tool that provides standard functionality (web platform, unlimited accounts, help support, data tagging) as well as some unique characteristics, as described below.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard functionality characteristics, ASPA requires a tool that enables staff to provide analysis and data mining of all social media-related activities related to a query, topic, phrases, program, etc., without any limitations based on the volume of data. For example, unknown outbreaks of diseases may cause unforeseen spikes on topics. Ubervu enables automatic reporting to be performed to ensure federal staff can quickly analyze data as necessary. Other tools require a cost increase for access to a specific number of "mentions" or "queries" which in turn are used to enable data mining and analysis by the tool.</p>
<p>Hootsuite uberVU is unique because it offers analysis of all social media-related activities through an algorithm that does not require viewing of all social media "mentions" by the user. Instead, its algorithm uses a sampling to provide for holistic reporting of sentiment, demographics, geographic data, and other characteristics on any query/key term/mention to make informed predictions about locations and demographics.</p>
<p>Hootsuite uberVU also provides for additional refinements and contextual information for the analysis and reporting of social media activity to include geo-based location and gender-based information. This feature allows ASPA to measure the effectiveness of its outreach efforts in a particular city/state and with specific targeted audiences. Competitors of uberVU use only user profile data and tagging of a post by account owners.</p>
<p>Finally, Hootsuite uberVU provides automated reporting and allows federal staff to customize the thresholds for each report - it does not set one parameter for all reports. These reports are distributed to stakeholders who may not have access to the tool, such as high-level HHS staff leadership, White House personnel, or Congressional members who are interested in specific topics. Hootsuite uberVU does not require account ownership to be established to view reports, thereby allowing federal staff to easily distribute reports to external stakeholders as necessary.</p>
<p>(xiv) The clauses at FAR 52.232-40, Providing Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors (DEC 2013); HHSAR 352.203-70, Anti-Lobbying (MAR 2012); and HHSAR 352.222-70, Contractor Cooperation in Equal Employment Opportunity Investigations (JAN 2010), apply to this acquisition.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(2)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database;<br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed throughhttps://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations.<br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />1352.201-70, CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (APRIL 2010) <br />The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APRIL 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<CONTACT>Edward Jackson
<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT TO THE PRE SOLICITATION NOTICE IS TO CHANGE THE SOLICITATION NUMBER FROM R15PS00175 TO R16PS00076 AND TO CHANGE THE ANTICIPATED REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) DATE FROM SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 TO NOVEMBER 16, 2015. 

Protective Coating IDIQ for Hoover Dam, Hoover Dam, Arizona - Nevada. 

The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Lower Colorado Region, has a requirement for the application of protective coatings to mitigate corrosion on steel and cast steel surfaces on turbine generators, steel structures, water tanks and various power plant equipment at Hoover Dam.  The work is located at Hoover Dam, on the Colorado River, approximately 7 miles northeast of Boulder City, Nevada, and 32 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, in Clark County, Nevada and Mohave County, Arizona. There may also be task orders issued for two other facilities on the Lower Colorado River, one at Davis Dam which operates in Nevada/Arizona and the other at Parker Dam which operates in Arizona/California.

The areas of steel to be coated vary depending on the work schedule.  In some years, less than one hundred square feet per year is coated, whereas in other years thousands of square feet are coated in a single year.  Due to time constraints, it is often necessary to schedule coating work into specific calendar timeframes to insure that coating does not interfere with other critical-path major maintenance schedules at Hoover Dam.

The work includes, but is not limited to, the following: 

(1) Furnishing, erecting and relocating scaffolding system for the external 30-foot diameter and 25-foot diameter penstock sections; both interior and exterior surfaces. 

(2) Furnishing, erecting and relocation scaffolding system for the external 13-foot diameter penstock laterals. The 13-foot diameter laterals in the lower penstocks are nearly horizontal.  However, the upper penstock 13-foot diameter laterals slope at an angle of 45 degrees. Each lateral is nearly 275 feet long. Work to include interior and exterior surfaces. 

(3) Furnishing, erecting and relocating scaffolding systems for the scroll cases, outlet work piping, steel water tanks, steel support towers, intake towers, draft-tube stop logs, intake gates and numerous other steel hydro facilities. 
	
(4) Coating removal, surface preparation, and coating of damaged areas in the interior and exterior of 30-foot diameter and 25-foot diameter penstock, outlet works piping and 13-foot diameter penstock sections, as well as the structures mentioned in item (3) directly above.

(5) Surface preparation and furnishing and applying protective coating for isolated spot repair of damaged areas. In certain cases, the work will be 100% removal and replacement and be determined by individual task orders.

(6) Control of leakage water, odors, pollutants and waste when applicable.

(7) Water blasting is the required coating removal method to control odors for Visitors Center and Powerhouse. The Visitors Center and the Powerhouse both use penstock tunnels as the source of building ventilation air. Sandblasting or needle-scaling methods will be approved on a case-by-case basis only when the contractor is able to control the atmosphere to breathing air standards.

(8) Waste management and mitigation is a requirement. Due to the age of the facilities, many steel structures have lead based paint and primers, which must follow Hazmat Regulations for exposure and mitigation.

(9) Work may also include other steel structural components such as towers, tanks, spillway gates and intake gates, which all require special equipment and procedures.

This solicitation is Unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 238320 Painting and Wall Covering Contractors, which has a small business size standard of $15M.  This acquisition will be pursued in accordance with FAR Part 15 and in accordance with the source selection evaluation criteria included in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Awards will be made using best-value, source-selection procedures incorporating tradeoffs between price and non-price factors.

<DESC>This contract action is being conducted pursuant to the procedures at FAR Subpart 16.505 under the auspices of Training Systems Contract III (TSC III) LOT I, a Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Multiple Award Contract (MAC). Therefore, pursuant to FAR Subpart 5.202(a)(6) and 16.505(a)(1), this contract action is exempt from synopsizing requirements. However, to increase transparency of NAWCTSD requirements and increase opportunities for subcontracting, notice of this opportunity is being provided. Only TSC III LOT I Prime Contractors (contractors previously awarded a contract within this vehicle) are considered an interested party in this contract action. All inquiries regarding participation as a subcontractor should be submitted to a Prime Contractor for consideration using the point of contact list provided.
 Any documents available for this contract action not otherwise attached hereto, including but not limited to Solicitations, Statements of Work (SOW), and Specifications will be made available only to qualifying Prime Contractors. 

The Marine Common Aircrew Trainer (MCAT) updated draft solicitation Attachments 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 12 and the Exhibits will be made available to all TSC III LOT I contract holders. Attachments 1-3 and the Exhibits will be made available via the AMRDEC due to their markings.  The System Engineering Plan will also be made available via the AMRDEC.  To obtain a copy of these documents a request must be submitted from an interested TSC III LOT I Prime contract holder and received by Mrs.
 Carlson via email.  These Attachments and Exhibits will be made available upon request.  Attachments 4, 8, 9 and 12 are provided as attachments to this announcement.  Currently, Attachment 12 is a combination of the questions and answers asked before the draft solicitation was made available and those asked after the draft solicitation was posted.  Since the draft solicitation has been posted, only the post draft solicitation questions and answers have been updated as the questions asked before the draft were posted with the draft solicitation itself.  When the final Request for Proposal (RFP) is posted in January both sets of Questions and Answers will be separate attachments to the RFP.  

It is anticipated by the Government that the final RFP will be issued in January of 2016.
  Therefore, the solicitation number will be updated to N61340-16-R-0006 at that time.  However, to remain consistent, RFP N61340-16-R-0006 will still be found in Federal Business Opportunities by referencing RFP N61339-15-R-0003.

Please contact Lynn Carlson if you have any questions pertaining to this posting or solicitation.

<p>The purpose of this rolling admission is to expand the contractor base by awarding additional Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) prime contracts. Existing Seaport-e prime contractors will also have the opportunity to expand their presence in other geographical zones to allow them to compete for Task Order awards in those zones and to voluntarily re-certify their size status. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541330 and the revenue size standard for Small Business is $38.5 Million.</p>
<p><br />SeaPort-e is the Navy's electronic platform for acquiring support services in 22 functional areas including Engineering, Financial Management, and Program Management. Authorized ordering activities compete their service requirements amongst SeaPort-e IDIQ multiple award contract holders. All task orders are competitively solicited, awarded and managed using the SeaPort-e electronic platform.</p>
<p>Oral proposals will not be conducted. Awards will be made on initial offers without discussions. Please email questions concerning Rolling Admissions to <a href="mailto:seaport_epco@navy.mil">seaport_epco@navy.mil</a>.</p>
<p>The Government desires an increase in Small Business, HubZone, Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB); Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB); Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB); and 8(a) concerns. Businesses in these categories are encouraged to submit offers as primes.</p>
<p>Information concerning this rolling admission is available on the Seaport homepage at www.seaport.navy.mil. Copies of the previous Rolling Admission solicitation N00178-14-R-4000, the original Rolling Admission Industry Brief (dated November 2004), and questions and answers to the previous solicitations can currently be found on the homepage.</p>
<p>The solicitation number for this Rolling Admissions is N00178-16-R-4000. It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued on 09 November 2015 with a response date of&nbsp;21 January 2016. The target date for the Rolling Admission awards is June 2016. The Government reserves the right to change these dates.

<DESC>The services covered under the above referenced purchase orders will be provided by a medical facility not covered under FCC Allenwood's Comprehensive Medical Contract, DJBP020100000027, through Seven Corners for the period of 11/01/15 - 11/30/15.
<p>High trauma and specialty care services are referred to Geisinger Medical Systems via 911 services or by a contracted network hospital or provider. Geisinger offers specialty care services and technology not available through any of the contracted network facilities or providers. Seven Corners is aware of the Government's use of this facility for high trauma and specialty care requirements. Follow up appointments for the inmates falling under this criteria will also be continued through Geisinger in order to maintain continuity of care for these inmates.</p>
<p>Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). The exception which permits use of the cited statutory authority is stated at FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>Normal procurement procedures could not be followed. This requirement is estimated at $98,000.</p>
<p>Seven Corners has attempted on several occasions to bring Geisinger Health Services and it's affiliates on board as a provider under DJBP020100000027. Geisinger Healthcare Systems is not interested in entering into a long term contractual agreement with our comprehensive contractor. The Government is left with no recourse other than to procure open market medical requirements through the Geisinger Medical Center and Geisinger Clinic when required.</p>
<p>The supplier, Geisinger, is actively registered in the CCR database, is not included in the Excluded Parties List System and has been determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1.</p>
<p>It has been determined by this Contract Specialist that the Health Services Administrator has provided for all procurement requirements to the best of his ability. Based on research and prior history in regards to this type of service, it has been determined that the dollar amount estimated for this particular order is both fair and reasonable. This Contracting Officer has determined that the price paid for these services will be fair and reasonable and that an affirmative determination of the hospitals responsibility has been made by this office.</p>

<DESC><p>Exception to Fair Opportunity for OnPoint Consulting, Inc.'s Task Order DE-DT0001389 with the Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration. The Office of Information Management and Chief Information Officer (NA-IM) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) plans to<br />contract for additional Information Assurance Response Center Cyber Security Support Services by using an exception to fair opportunity. The contracting activity is the NNSA Non-M&amp;O Contracting Operations Division, Services Acquisition Branch, Headquarters Program<br />Section (NA-APM-124.1).</p>
<p>This acquisition action is to modify OnPoint Consulting, Inc. Task Order GS-06F-0648Z/DEDT0001389 to extend the period of performance for six months to include a one-month base period, one two-month option period, and three one-month option periods. Task Order DEDT0001389 was awarded to OnPoint Consulting, Inc. (OnPoint), 2107 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 510, Arlington, VA 22201, for NA-IM, on April 21, 2010, pursuant to a fair opportunity competition under the General Services Administration's (GSA) Alliant Small Business (ASB) Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC), which was open to all awardees under the ASB GWAC. Task Order DE-DT0001389 was awarded for a five year period of performance from April 21, 2010 - April 20, 2015 inclusive of one two-year base period, one one-year option period, and one two-year option period. The firm fixed price task order has a current ceiling price of $96,701,007.84. On April 14, 2015, the contract was extended for six months to October 31, 2015. This six month extension was required in order for the agency to resolve a protest that an unsuccessful vendor filed in response to the award of the IT Infrastructure and Cyber Security (IICS) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). The protest pushed back the timeline for the award of the follow-on. Task Orders under the BPA. The government anticipates that an award for the follow-on Task Order to DE-DT0001389 will be made no later than December 1, 2015, but is seeking the<br />option to extend the contract until April 30, 2016 to allow time to resolve any protests that may arise following the Task Order awards.</p>
