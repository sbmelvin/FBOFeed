River Partners, a non-profit habitat restoration organization, will be contracted with to conduct drilling, broadcasting, seed collection and processing.   River Partners is the only organization in the local area capable of performing large scale grassland restoration activities.  They have already restored over 800 acres of riparian habitat on SJRNWR as part of a CALFED funded project and are preparing to plant another 200 acres in the coming months.  They have utilized a seed drill and broadcaster extensively on the Refuge, and have collected and processed large quantities of native forb seed for previous projects.   Their expertise in native vegetation restoration, having equipment and labor already in place on SJRNWR (including a new Truax® seed drill), and local knowledge of the site will allow this project to be completed efficiently.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for the following SOW: Statement of Work for PR 4200114160 Kinetic Metallization Coating of Copper and GrCop-84 Liners The objective of this work is to deposit advanced coatings by Kinetic Metallization on copper and GRCop-84 thrust cell liners.  Only Kinetic Metallization, a low temperature, high sonic accelerant gas velocity coating deposition process is an acceptable method for applying these coatings since the objective is to evaluate coatings applied by this method.  The vendor shall perform the following tasks using the Kinetic Metallization (KM) sonic accelerant gas velocity coating process.  Three different substrates are to be sprayed: flat 1”x2” coupons, copper liners and GrCop-84 liners.  The coating thicknesses are as described below in the section Coating Composition and Thicknesses.  The government shall supply all substrates, the geometries of which are described in Government Furnished Property below.  The government shall also supply all powders as described in Government Furnished Property below.   Task (1) Coat 4 1” x 2” x 0.047” flat coupons  The vendor shall determine what, if any, non-normal angle of incidence is required to spray the inside of the copper and GrCop-84 liners.  The vendor will then coat 1”x2” coupons at angles which bracket that non-normal angle to demonstrate that the vendor can spray acceptable coatings at that angle.  For example, if the vendor cannot spray inside the liners at a normal angle of 90 degrees to the liner wall but must angle the spray 30 degrees from the normal, the vendor shall spray 1”x2” coupons at appropriate angles greater than and less than the spray angle (such as 20 to 40 degrees from the normal in the example).  The angles shall be pre-approved by the Government.  Four 1”x2” coupons are to be sprayed, two copper and two GrCop-84, one copper and one GrCop-84 at the lower angle and one copper and one GrCop-84 at the higher angle.   Upon completion of spraying, the vendor is to submit at least half (1”x1”) of each of the four 1”x2” coupons to the Government for evaluation.  The remaining half may be retained by the vendor to be evaluated. Task (2) Coat interior surfaces of copper liner One copper liner shall be coated on all interior surfaces.  The coated liner shall be submitted to the Government for evaluation.   Task (3) (Optional)  Coat interior surfaces of GrCop-84 and/or copper liners At the Government’s option and based on the Government’s evaluation of the coated liner in Task (2), the vendor shall coat a total of three liners, either (a) three GrCop-84 liners, or (b) two GrCop-84 liners and one copper liner.     A decision will be made by the Government whether to exercise the optional Task (3) within three weeks of receipt of the coated copper liner.  Evaluation criteria will focus on coating uniformity  and thickness as well as coating density.  Coating quality at the throat is critical.  If the optional Task (3) is exercised, a decision will be made at the same time by the Government whether to coat three GrCop-84 liners, or two GrCop-84 liners and one copper liner. All coatings shall be sprayed by Kinetic Metallization and processed in such a manner to be dense, well bonded, and defect free prior to delivery to NASA Glenn Research Center.  Metallographic inspection or similar method is required to demonstrate process capability before deliverables  provided to the Government.   All materials will be returned to the Government at the conclusion of this work. Coating Composition and Thicknesses   The nominal compositions of the two coatings to be applied are: Cu-8 wt. % Cr-1 wt. % Al (bond coat) Ni-17 wt. % Cr-6 wt. % Al-0.5 wt. % Y (top coat) Coating thicknesses are as follows: Bond coat: 0.003-0.004” thick Top coat: 0.008-0.010” thick. Government Furnished Property The Government shall furnish the following items: 1.	Minimum of fourteen pounds of Ni-17Cr-6Al-0.5Y powder, nominal -625 mesh size 2.	Minimum of six pounds of Cu-8Cr-1Al powder, nominal -625 mesh size 3.	Sixteen pieces of GRCop-84 sheet, nominally 1” x 2” x 0.040” thick 4.	Eight pieces of OHFC copper sheet, nominally 1”x 2”x 0.125” thick 5.	A minimum of three and a maximum of four copper liners. The copper liner is described in the attached drawing entitled “Copper Liner” and is described with reference to the detailed drawings supplied for the GrCop-84 liner (see next item). 6.	If the option in Task (3) is exercised by the Government, a minimum of two and a maximum of three GrCop-84 liners.  The GrCop-84 liners are described in the attached drawing entitled “GrCop-84 Liner”.   Deliverables •	Four 1”x2” coupons of copper (2 each) and GrCop-84 (2 each) coated at different angles as described in Task (1). •	One copper liner with interior coated. •	If the option in Task (3) is exercised by the Government, three coated liners, either (a) three GrCop-84 liners, or (b) two GrCop-84 and one copper liner. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Innovative Technology, Inc. (DBA) INOVATI, of Goleta, California.  INOVATI's previous support and technology proves to be the only company that can sucessful provide adherent coatings on GRCop-84. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 8, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to negotiate with The Standard and Poor’s on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S. c. 253 (c) (1) only one responsible source.  This requirement is for a base period of 12-months with an additional four 12-month option periods.

The requirement is to provide the Department of Commerce the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) economic measurements as part of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs).   The NIPAs are used for a variety of purposes in setting national economic policy and in forecasting and interpreting macroeconomic activity.  They include gross domestic product (GDP), which are considered the most useful summary measure of the nation’s production, and related measures.  BEA, as one of the world’s leading statistical agencies, collects source data, conducts research and analysis, develops and implements estimation methodologies and disseminates statistics to the public.   Standard and Poor Compustate Server, has provided the data set for many years.  This detailed data allows the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) access to a database that can be searched for keyword and /or items.
    
In summary,  under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1) it has been determined the Standard & Poor’s Compustate Service Inc. is uniquely qualified because of their experience and knowledge in providing financial data that has the range, timeliness, and technical availability that meet critical source data needs to support the Bureau’s mission of developing and releasing critical national economic estimates. 

Offeror’s certain they can meet the requirements are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response which details their technical information demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirement.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Note 22 applies to this requirement.

<DESC>This is a combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSCEAM-05-R-00030, which is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This requirement is a small business set-aside.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699 and the small business size standard is $6.0 million.


The proposed ranges must meet the following standards to qualify for consideration:

	As set forth in the section entitled, “Location and Schedule Requirements,” the range must be available exclusively to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the time indicated.  

	The range may be indoors or outdoors and shall possess a minimum of ten (10) firing points with compressor and small generator.  An indoor range shall possess air conditioning, heating, and approved ventilation system in conformance with existing OSHA standards.

	The range shall be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and a maximum of 25 yards. There shall be firing lines at the 1.5, 3, 7, 15 and 25 yard lines.

	The range shall possess moveable barricades for the 15 and 25-yard line course of fire.  The barricades shall be constructed of a material that does not deflect or ricochet rounds that inadvertently strike it. (Example: wood)

	The range should possess a public address system available during firearms training.

	The range should possess some type of classroom/instructional facility with marking board and/or chalkboard, and seating for a minimum of 25 students.  If a classroom is not available, a covered or enclosed area with seating for a minimum of 25 students, free from the elements, must be available for instructional purposes. 

	The range shall possess a secure storage area dedicated exclusively to DHS under the resultant contract.  This secure storage area shall be capable of storing at least 5000 rounds of pistol ammunition; 100 cardboard type target backers and targets; a portable stand-up 20-gallon compressor and a 12 position portable turning target system.

	The range shall be equipped with men and women’s restroom facilities with running water.

	The range shall possess an area in which to clean weapons. This area shall be equipped with sufficient countertop/tabletop space for multiple users at one time. 

The range shall provide sufficient trash receptacles for used targets, target backers, and empty ammunition boxes.

	The range shall be able to accommodate the following calibers:  .357 SIG, 9mm Luger, and .40.

	The range shall possess adequate parking to accommodate a minimum of 15 vehicles.

	The range rules cannot disallow movement between firing points or restrict movement-oriented firearms at firing points by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions).  The range rules cannot disallow students from drawing and firing from the holster or from concealment.  The ranges rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present (i.e., tactical move and shoot type drills where student/ instructor ratio would be too restrictive).  The range rules shall allow shooters to utilize weapons on fully automatic during drills.

	The estimated number days for range usage per quarter is 24 days.  The estimated number of rounds fired is 175,000 per quarter.


ATTACHMENT 1
	 
LOCATION AND SCHEDULE REQUIREMENTS

The range must be closed or concealed from the public during the corresponding hours.

Under this contract, DHS requires exclusive use of the range from 0800 to 1630 hours, a minimum of 8 days a month with one segment in a block of 5 consecutive days.  This does not include weekends or holidays, however, there may occasionally be circumstances wherein a day of a weekend may be needed. 

Should weather (i.e., rainout) or unforeseen circumstances prevent the use of the range, DHS will have priority in re-scheduling those missed days within the same month if possible, or the following month if not possible.   

	The range shall be within a 75 minute commute of Highway 290 and Beltway 8.  The 75-minute commute will be assessed in consideration of prime, rush hour traffic in both the morning and late afternoon/early evening.

<SOLNBR>KAQ051005
<RESPDATE>062405
<ARCHDATE>06032006
<CONTACT>Dave Johnson Agreements Speacilist 3077756059     Dave_Johnson@blm.gov;
<DESC>Shirley Mountain Stewardship The proposed action is to conduct a hazardous fire fuels and biomass removal operation on a 4200 acre section of 25, 866 acres of BLM adminstered lands on the Shirley Mountain.  The goal is to treat 500 acres of scattered diseased and insect infested BLM forest lands within the proposed 4200 acre treatment area.  Opreations will consist of the salvage of a valuable resource (fuel wood/woody biomass) while it still retains economic value and a use to man in exchange for services; i.e. removing and/or pile for burning (by BLM Fuels Crew) hazardous fire fuel materials and biomass located within the project area.  In addition to achieving a short term objective of utilizing a natural resource for human use and benefit, other long term objectives of the project are to reduce hazordous fire fuel loading in the area to lessen the chances of a catastrophic wildfire event occuring as well as improve wildlife habitat. The proposed action would be implemented by the insurance of a Federal Stewardship contract with applicable stipulations.  Work would start only after authorization is granted.  The work would involve the severing of dead standing trees with a chainsaw at a maximum of one half (1/2) foot above ground.  Severed standing dead trees along with downed (blowdown) dead trees still of merchanable value will be bucked and removed from the project area by the contractor for personal use.  All non-removed or non-useable materials in the project area will be bucked and piled in 20 feet high and 10 feet wide slash piles to later be burned by the BLM Fire Fuels Crew.  By accepting the merchantable wood materials from the project for personal use, there will be no monetary payment to the contractor for the services rendered.  Only the existing road system will be used to conduct the project.  No new roads will be constructed.  Geographic Description: T25N, R81W, SEC.6&7/T25N, R82W, SEC.1,2,11,&12  The present forest conditions are undesirable from the standpoint of forest health and management.  The amount of dead standing, downed trees, and accumulation of biomass in the project area (caused from disease, insect outbreaks, drought stress, and/or overstocked stands), presents the possibility for the occurance of a catastrophic wildfire event.  Due the these poor forest health conditions, forest stands along with their respected ecosystems are in jeopardy of being lost from the area as a result of such said event.  This also may lead to the loss of critical wildlife habitat for wildlife in the proposed project area dependant upon this ecosystem for survival. In short, the proposed project area has turned into a large wildfire hazard due to the excess buildup of dead woody materials.  Therefore, management actions are needed to allow this forest ecosystem to return to a healthier condition. Goals are: 1.  To salvage a valuable resource wile it still retains an economic value and use to man, reduce hazardous fire fuel loading and biomass build-up within the project area and provide a healthly forested landscape for both human and wildlife benefit. 2.  To provide an income source to local contractors, producing 30 to 60 cords per acre of fire wood and biomass materials valued commercially at $10.00 per cord. The per acre value for this project is $300 to $600 per acre.

<SOLNBR>MOVES1
<RESPDATE>061005
<ARCHDATE>06252005
<CONTACT>SCOTT THARP, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone (513)487-2092, Fax (513)487-2107, Email THARP.SCOTT@EPA.GOV
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Assessment and Standards Division of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality is developing a data-driven emission model known as the Mobile Source Emission Simulator (MOVES).  A data-driven model is easier to update than one where vehicle and emission relationships are computer coded.  This approach puts great emphasis on finding data of sufficient breadth and scope to cover vehicle emission rates which were previously based on small engineering studies or theoretical constructs.  The search for data from as many sources as possible is therefore an important part of EPA’s emission modeling.

An extensive volume of emissions data currently exists.  Most of this data is in the form of state-sponsored Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs involving either transient loaded emissions tests or remote sensing (RSD) of vehicles on the road.  The database from these tests consists of millions of records associated with millions of tests.  The data’s utility is that it contains emission rates from vehicles with atypical emissions and captures the effect of I/M programs on vehicle emission inventories, both of which are important issues that MOVES must address.

Two testing contractors have been responsible for the collection and reporting of data from most of the I/M transient loaded emission tests conducted in North America, namely Environmental Systems Products Holding, Inc. (ESP) of East Granby, CT, and Gordon-Darby, Inc., of Phoenix, AZ.  Additionally, ESP is the sole source for all state RSD programs within the United States.   Accordingly, consistent with Section 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the USEPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with ESP and Gordon-Darby to obtain all pertinent transient emission test data (I/M 240 type) from each firm, and all state I/M RSD data from ESP.

THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing the required test data may submit technical documentation to establish capability of delivering such data.  Such documentation must be submitted to the EPA point of contact within 7 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via fax 513-487-2107 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be accepted.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The Naval Surface Warfare Ce! nter, Dahlgren Division intends to purchase a Varian, Inc. 2100T Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS), or equal.  The GC-MS must meet the following salient characteristics:  The delivery date for the instrument must be no later than 24 June 2005.  The measurements of the unit must be no more than 20 inches high, no more than 24 inches deep, and a maximum of 25.5 inches in length.  These dimensions are the maximum allowable for the unit to fit into a bio and chemical hazard fume hood.  The chemicals to be tested and detected with this instrument will be Center for Disease Control regulated biotoxins and all equipment must fit inside this hood.  The hood is a built-in feature of the laboratory and the cost of expanding the hood would be very prohibitive.  The GC-MS must be able to measure compounds with a molecular weight of at least 625 atomic mass units (AMU’s).  The biotoxins and the decontaminants used in this testing possess components near this molecular weight.  ! Inability to process compounds of this molecular weight will cause the instrument to fail and as such would not allow for project completion.  The MS-computer portion of the instrument must possess the capability to analyze and identity the biotoxins and their fragmented by-products.  The GC-MS must be fitted with an Autosampler that would allow for both off gassing sampling, and direct solution injection.  The autosampler is required in order to minimize potentially hazardous chemical exposure to those performing the experiments.  The power requirements for the unit are that it must run off of 115 VAC, 60HZ, and not draw more than 20 amps of current.  Award is to be made under simplified acquisition procedures on an all or none basis.  The closing date is 10 June 2005.  Anticipated award date is 14 June 2005.  Pricing should be FOB Destination to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA  22448-5100.  THE GOVERNMENT SHALL NOT ISS!

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Cellular and Systems Neurobiology Section (CSNS) plans to procure on a sole source basis services with Drexel University, 3201 Arch Street, Suite 100, Philadelphia, PA  19104.   Project Title: Modeling State-Dependent Neural Mechanisms for Generation of Respiratory Rhythm and Pattern.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The procurement will be processed in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures stated in FAR Part 13.   Research in the Cellular and Systems Neurobiology Section (CSNS) is devoted to understanding fundamental neurobiological mechanisms generating patterns of neural activity, underlying rhythmic breathing movements in the mammalian central nervous system. This procurement is associated with a project concerning the analysis of the functional and structural properties of brainstem networks responsible for generating the neural activity underlying breathing in the mammalian nervous system. Specifically, the project involves the development of realistic large-scale computer models of brainstem respiratory neural control networks in the mammalian nervous system.  Currently this research has reached an advanced stage where very large-scale models (i.e., models incorporating hundreds to thousands of interacting neurons) are required to make further progress in understanding brain mechanisms controlling breathing.  Over the past five years Drexel University has developed computer-based, prototype large-scale models of the brainstem respiratory network. These computational models incorporate specific cellular properties and network architectures that experimental results obtained by the NINDS, CSNS indicate, are required to faithfully mimic and explore the behavior of real respiratory networks in the brainstem.   Period of Performance:  July 1, 2005 – June 30, 2006. Drexel University has also developed a unique software environment for running simulations with these models and for analyzing simulation results.  Drexel University is the only source known to NINDS that has the prototype models that meet the experimental laboratory requirements. In addition, Drexel University has model prototypes with specific model formulation and model prototypes which are readily extensible to meet NINDS requirements.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NINDS researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on June 17, 2005.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.   Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) in order to receive an award.

The objective of Iron Creek Road Stabilization Project is to replace culverts with larger structures capable of passing 100 year flows, sediment and likely large wood.  The project will on will implement road improvements on Forest Roads 2517 by enhancing drainage to both minimize sediment delivery and maintain access.  Two undersized culverts will be removed and replaced with larger elliptical corrugated metal pipes (10 feet in diameter) capable of withstanding 100-year flow events and likely debris.   Additional structural protection (e.g. rip wrap) and local road maintenance  (waterbars and road dips) will also be constructed to prevent erosion, intercept concentrated flows and provide drainage relief.

Project Location

FROM RANDLE, WA. Go South on Forest Road 25 for 17.26 miles to the 2516 road then 1.1 miles West to the 2516021 then 0.8 miles South to the 2517 road then 0.8 miles West on the 2517 road to the work site. You cannot reach the two work sites by going from the 25 road up the 2517 due to a closed bridge at milepost 1.9 of the 2517 road.

The Government's estimate is:  Between $25,000 and $100,000.

Estimated issued date is June 17
Estimated closing date is July 8

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-234 is responsible for the maintenance of the J52-P-408 jet engine and its associated support equipment, which provides primary power for the EA-6B aircraft.  The J52’s 4.5 bearing has been the root cause of three (3) class A mishaps since November 2001.  In order to minimize the risk of in-flight failure of the 4.5 bearing, PMA-234 procured 15 Filter Debris Analysis (FDA) machines from GASTOPS, Inc. of Ottawa, Canada.  The FDA machines have demonstrated ability to analyze material in the J52 Engine oil filter and detect evidence of impending J52 4.5 bearing failure before the failure becomes catastrophic.  The Navy now requires upgrade kits and installation for 10 of the machines previously procured, 5 additional FDA machines (Part Number B067261), and an operator training package.  NAVAIR intends to award this requirement on a Firm Fixed Price, commercial sole source basis to GASTOPS, Inc., 11 East Olive Road, Suite B, Pensacola, Florida, 32514.  As the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the FDA machine, GASTOPS is the only known source with the proprietary knowledge, experience, and data to manufacture and integrate the improvements needed to enable the Navy to meet mission requirements.  Delivery will be F.O.B. Destination, within 90 days ARO.  The contractor shall extend to the Government full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered on a similar commercial sale.  Acceptance of warranty does not waive the Government’s rights under the Inspection clause, nor does it limit the Government’s rights with regard to other terms and conditions of the resulting contract.  The SIC Code for this requirement will be 3728, the NAICS code will be 336413, the FSC code will be 4920, and the small business size standard is 1000.  All other responsible sources may submit a brief one-page statement demonstrating their capability to perform this requirement.  These responses may be submitted via email to candice.anderson@navy.mil or may be faxed to (301) 757-6516, Attn:  Candice Anderson, Code AIR-2.5.1.8.1.7.  Please respond via email or fax; no phone calls will be accepted.  Note:  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DoD activity.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government is not committed nor obligated to pay for the information provided and no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of this synopsis.  No solicitation documents exist and no further information is available at this time.  Numbered note 22 applies.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, 
Fax: (703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Dr. Nikola Nikolov; Chairman; Council of Ministers, State Agency Civil Protection, 30, Nikola Gabrovski Street; Sofia 1172, Bulgaria; Phone: 359-2-960-10211 or 962-0439; Fax: 359-2-868-8115; E-mail: sacp@cp.government.bg.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to define the architecture for the IEMS and the terms of reference (TOR) for a Phase II pilot study in Plovdiv.

Bulgaria’s emergency management system, referred to as the  “Civil Protection” system, is civilian-led, based on laws and executive orders, and is an all-hazards system.  The Bulgarian Council of Ministers has established a “Standing Committee on the Protection of the Population in the Cases of Disasters and Accidents,” reporting to the Prime Minister.  The working body of this Standing Committee is the State Agency Civil Protection (CPA), which is responsible for coordinating Bulgaria’s national strategy for emergency management.  The Standing Committee and the State Agency connect the four levels of civil protection activity: national; regional; municipal; and peripheral.  

The CPA has established 14 teams for emergency-rescue activities at the regional civil protection directorates, with a staff of some four hundred personnel deployed in 55 rescue teams, with rotating shifts providing continuous rescue and emergency medical coverage.

While considerable organizational structure and staffing already exists at the local and regional levels — local police and firefighting agencies, diving and alpine rescue teams, emergency medical agencies and the like — the CPA seeks to develop an IEMS to coordinate emergency response activities on the local, regional, and national levels.  The CPA proposes to develop the architecture for the IEMS and design a pilot project in the Plovdiv municipality to demonstrate the IEMS.   The proposed pilot would create a plan for cooperation among all governmental organizations (fire, police, rescue and others).  Cooperative efforts would be focused particularly on mutual sharing of databases, as well as the development of networks to permit real-time sharing of information during a crisis.  A Regional Emergency Center (REC) would be established to coordinate the various activities.  This center would be both a clearinghouse of information through a dedicated Internet portal and database exchange, and a communication channel.  The REC would include a security and disaster recovery solution in case the REC itself is affected.  A database storage system with back up and retrieval would be implemented as part of the REC.  

The project would also involve the establishment of IEMS infrastructure design for other municipal emergency centers to be created on a shared basis with local fire and rescue emergency centers.  The municipal emergency centers would act as points of communication and coordination, and would coordinate closely with the REC.  At present, most municipalities outside Sofia and Plovdiv have very little IEMS infrastructure.  Municipal emergency centers are critical to ensure that emergency management works regionally.  Because other regions must also acquire integrated emergency management capabilities, it is highly likely that they will follow the technological standards and solutions developed in Plovdiv.  The study and pilot together would establish a prototype design for IEMS transferable to other regional and municipal emergency centers, on a shared basis with existing local fire rescue emergency centers.   The IEMS can be defined in three major steps:

·	Definition of a functional model
·	Agreement on system architecture
·	Deployment of supporting infrastructure

A unified command and control center (for multiple first responders) would be at the center stage of the actual deployment of the IEMS.  This would incorporate the operations protocols, provisions for data collection, and exchange and voice communications.  There would be both primary and back-up control centers linked to satellite sites in the districts.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $291,340 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m., July 11, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

Notice of Intent to Lease Space
Using Other Than Full and Open Competition
Miami, Florida

The United States Government intends to award a succeeding lease, using other than full and open competition to The Miami-Dade Aviation Department. The lease will be for 20,648 rentable square feet of fully serviced space for a term of ten years. 

The government has a continuing need for this space.  It has been determined that a succeeding lease will result in less cost to the federal government when the economics of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.  

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the government's intent to award this project under Other than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Joseph R. Crenshaw, Contracting Officer at GSA, Realty Services Division (4PEY), Timberlake Federal Annex, Room 600, 501 East Polk Street, Tampa, Florida, 33602. Any written comments are to be received by the Contracting Officer within 10 days of the publication of this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<ARCHDATE>09132005
<CONTACT>Tyrone M. Knight, 410 278-2465
<DESC>Background:  Historically, Soldier equipment has fit together more by coincidence than by design. However, the technology boom has made possible the most significant transformation of the Soldier in half a century. The Army recognized the need to foc us, refine, and leverage new technologies and created a single acquisition office to champion the war fighting needs of the Soldier. Program Executive Office (referred to hereafter as PEO) Soldier stood up in April 2002. PEO Soldier's mission is to arm and  equip Soldiers to dominate the full spectrum of peace and war, now and in the future. To achieve this mission, the Army is treating the Soldier as a System, in the same sense that larger weapon platforms such as tanks, howitzers, and aircraft function as systems and integrate with other systems. All aspects of Soldier equipment are developed to be integrated, modular, interoperable, and mission-tailorable. The result is a single integrated combat system that enhances Soldier performance in all critical are as: increased effectiveness, decreased load, and improved mission flexibility. By managing the Soldier as a System, PEO Soldier will save Soldiers' lives, improve their quality of life, and increase their combat effectiveness. PEO Soldier comprises three P roject Management Offices and seven Product Manager Offices:  Project Manager Soldier Warrior (PM SWAR); Project Manager Soldier Equipment (PM SEQ); and Project Manager Soldier Weapons (PM SW).  PM SWAR includes Product Managers Land Warrior, Air Warrior a nd Future Warrior.  PM SEQ includes Product Manager Sensors and Lasers and Product Manager Clothing and Individual Equipment. PM SW includes Product Manager Individual Weapons and Product Manager Crew-Served Weapons.   Through the PEO Public Affairs Office, the PEO creates exhibit booths as part of its communication outreach program to Army and Department of Defense leadership, Army war fighters, Congressional representatives, developers, industry, other Government entit ies, and the general public.  The purpose of the exhibits, product portfolio, and associated educational items and graphic/media products is to provide education and training on the value of PEO programs and products. Request:  THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. NO PROPOSALS ARE REQUIRED AT THIS TIME. The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Acquisition Center intends to issue a solicitation on or about 17 June 2005 for exhibit and exhibit-rel ated support services and other deliverables to PEO Soldier and its subordinate Project/Product Managers (PMs).  These services will augment existing PEO Soldier resources with capabilities not available from within the core PEO structure.  The contractor will: 1) design, develop, produce and maintain exhibits and associated equipment; 2) design, develop, produce and maintain a PEO Soldier product portfolio; and, 3) recommend, develop and provide educational display items and/or graphic/media design support  services and deliverables.  PEO uses in-house resources for public affairs, general communications, media, and graphics work.  This contract will augment those resources, and is not duplicative.   PEO will expect the contractor to support approximately seventy (70) conference exhibits per year.  Of these 70 conference exhibits, approximately ten (10) are deemed to be large exhibits, such as the annual Association of the United States Army (AUSA) c onference, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States (EANGUS), National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), and Soldier Technology Events.  These exhibits are typically 3-5 days in duration (for the actual conference -  -this does not include set up and breakdown days) and 60 linear feet in size.  The remaining sixty (60) exhibits are smaller, either in duration of the conference, or size of the exhibit, or both.  Such smaller exhibits include live fires, small demos w ith storyboards, and the lik e.   For any given conference, PEO may design and develop conference exhibits and display items using in-house resources, or PEO may require the contractor, under this contract to design and/or develop conference exhibits and display items.  The contractor shal l be required to provide operational support at the exhibit booth during a conference. To obtain more information about PEO Soldier see their web site at http://peosoldier.army.mil/index.php. This will be a competitive acquisition for the award of a time and materials contracts to deliver exhibit and exhibit-related support services and other deliverables to PEO Soldier and its subordinate Project/Product Managers (PMs). The contract will be aw arded for one 12-month base period, and will have four 12-month option periods.  The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the government after evaluation in accorda nce with the factors and subfactors of the solicitation.

<DESC>This is modification 1 to the synopsis entitled Mini-Aercam Communications Antenna Solicitation Number NNJ05113279Q which was posted on May 31, 2005. The purpose of this modification is to clarify that the project need date for the Mini AERCam is not based on the near-term return to flight schedule, i.e. July 2005. Furthermore, the Mini AERCam will not support return to flight or near-in missions. However, the Mini AERCam is a candidate Shuttle Thermal Protection System inspection method. For Shuttle or Station missions, Mini AERCam could support external robotic operations by supplying situational awareness views to robotic operators, supply views of spacewalk operations to flight and/or ground crews, and carry out independent visual inspections. Due to the development schedule for Mini AERCam to potentially support future Shuttle or Station missions, including the multiple runs required for the antenna design, there cannot be any delays to the schedule. The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/JSC Business Opportunities home page is	http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	 Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.

Faith Based and Community Organizations have an equal right to submit competitive proposals for any resulting contract(s)   The BOP may  fulfill this requirement through either a single or multiple awards.  The offered institution(s) may have capacity to house more beds than those proposed, and offerors are not prohibited from housing non-BOP inmates at the institution(s).  If the proposed institution(s) houses a mixed population of BOP and non-BOP inmates, offers will be evaluated to determine the soundness and effectiveness in managing and operating the shared institution(s).  Institutions proposed shall meet BOP standards as set forth in the resulting contract.

The offeror awarded the contract must be ready to accept inmates 120 days after contract award at a rate specified in the resulting contract.  Past performance and experience will be significant factors in the evaluation of offers.

<DESC>Seeking Offers to Disseminate NASA Information by Means of Consumer Products or Services Statement of Purpose The National Aeronautics and Space Administration seeks one or more unfunded collaborations with organizations that produce, market, and distribute consumer goods or services for the sole purpose of disseminating information nationally about NASA's upcoming STEREO mission which will image the Sun in 3-D. NASA is interested in reviewing proposals from organizations that share NASA's mission, values, and goals, and that would strategically enhance the Agency's ability to provide information on NASA's projects and missions to the public. For more information on the STEREO mission, set to launch in February 2006, please see:	  http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov	    .  NASA is interested in reviewing creative proposals from organizations that would enhance strategically the Agency's ability to provide information on NASA's projects and missions to the public, especially for the following age groups: •	12 – 17 •	18 – 35 Key Assets of STEREO Mission •	The STEREO mission will be the first ever to image the Sun in 3-D. •	Images of the Sun transmitted to Earth from the two spacecraft will be in a glorious high-definition format around April 2006. Top-quality 'mock' images and complementary animations are available immediately for distribution. •	The mission utilizes an unusual combination of two nearly identical spacecraft working together to understand the Sun and solar wind.	Launched on a single rocket, the STEREO mission will use the Moon to “slingshot” the two spacecraft into their unique vantage points leading and lagging the Earth as it orbits the Sun. •	Visualizations and animations are available immediately in 3-D for print and broadcast formats.  •	STEREO will further the burgeoning field of "space weather forecasting," providing information about the effects of solar events in other parts of the solar system, namely Mars, where we currently have very little information. This is a vital link to NASA's Vision for Space Exploration.  •	STEREO will provide new insights into Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), among the most violent events in the solar system.  When directed at Earth, these billion-ton eruptions of electrified gas can disrupt satellites, radio communications, and power systems. Energetic particles accelerated by CMEs are a substantial hazard to both spacecraft and astronauts. NASA will enter into as many qualified collaborations as possible, without limiting the types or categories of products or services considered. However, if multiple offers are received in one particular category, NASA may need to select only one offer in a product or service category for a specific time period (defined as "limited exclusivity"). It is intended that this request for entrepreneurial offers will result in the establishment of one or more non-reimbursable Space Act Agreements that will define the full roles and responsibilities of NASA and the proposing organization(s). Benefits to Corporate Partner In exchange for a collaborator's investment to create and implement a means to creatively disseminate NASA information, NASA may consider negotiating brand placement, limited exclusivity (defined above) and other opportunities as part of a strategic collaboration. Consideration may be made for those offers that are commensurate to the value of the above, and that reflect NASA mission and vision. Evaluation Criteria All proposals must demonstrate the following to be considered: •	The mission statements for the product or service being offered must complement STEREO and NASA's Vision and Mission: NASA's Vision is "to improve life here, to extend life there and to find life beyond;" NASA's Mission statement is "to understand and protect our home planet, to explore the universe and search for life, and to inspire the next generation of explorers … as only NASA can." •	The product or service is available nationally, e.g. it could be used to disseminate NASA information across the nation. If these threshold requirements are met, NASA may enter into an agreement with the offeror(s) whose proposal is most advantageous to the government based on these eight factors: 1.	Appropriateness of the product or service as a means to disseminate NASA information. This includes how much NASA information can be put forth on, in, or associated with the consumer product or service. In addition, the appropriateness and innovation of the dissemination method to provide national dissemination of NASA information to one of the above-mentioned target groups. NASA is looking for opportunities that will best utilize the product or service effectively to impart as much knowledge of NASA projects and programs as practical. 2.	Documented metrics on the demographics and popularity of the product or service. 3.	Documentation on the success of the product or service in reaching the target audience effectively, and other results-oriented documentation. 4.	Information on the managing team. Specifically looking for metrics on their experience in conducting successful campaigns, as well as points of contact and top-level organizational structure. 5.	Market analysis and strategy analysis of the product or service. 6.	Evidence of financial stability, such as annual audits, balance sheets, and appropriate documentation. 7.	Projected schedule and milestones to create and distribute the product or service to disseminate NASA information. 8.	Any other aspects of collaboration with the offeror that would benefit NASA's ability to meet its mission and vision. Additionally, the proposal and the proposed method of dissemination must be consistent with applicable NASA statutes, policy, and regulations.  Requirements for Proposal Preparation This request will be open for eight weeks following the date of release of this announcement. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by NASA. This request is not to be construed as a commitment by NASA, nor will NASA pay for the information solicited. Respondents will be sent an acknowledgement of the receipt of their materials. Any questions regarding this request should be directed to the identified point of contact. Submittals should be limited to no more than 15 pages double-spaced, 1" margins using Times New Roman 12-point type. Excluded from the 15-page limitation are: documentation regarding factor 5 and 6 above. Submission may be in either hard-copy format or on compact disk in PDF format. Submission must be received at the address indicated below no later that 4:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, on July 29, 2005.

<DESC>The California Institute of Technology’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Caltech/ JPL), operating under a prime contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), seek responses to this Request for Information (RFI) for industry feedback on capabilities in dynamic analysis and simulations and interest of potential proposers in competing to provide supplemental analysis on an as needed basis. Contracts with JPL are funded by NASA and are subcontracted under a NASA prime contract with Caltech. BACKGROUND: The Laboratory's Structures and Dynamics Groups have supported numerous projects requiring dynamic simulations of events such as boom deployments, separations, and other multi-body simulations.  These types of simulations require a high level of expertise and experience to accurate define the problem and develop the model necessary to capture the relevant behavior. Over the past few years, JPL has had difficulty supporting all projects in this area because of the number of analysts and competing work. This trend is expected to continue over the next few years with the current and future projects such as Mars Science Laboratory, Phoenix, and Hydros.   The Instrument Mechanical and Spacecraft Mechanical Sections are interested in establishing a Task Work Order Subcontract with an analytical group that can provide additional project support in dynamic analysis and simulations when needed. The necessary features of this group would be: (a) Minimum ten (10) years experience in simulations of multi-body dynamics and contact dynamics simulations for mechanical systems is preferred; (b) Well established infrastructure for analysis of component to system level mechanical systems; (c) Analytical tools compatible with JPL modeling and analysis tools, primarily ADAMS and NASTRAN; (d) Additional analytical tools capable of performing independent analyses to verify JPL efforts using ADAMS and/or NASTRAN; (e) Sufficient workforce to respond quickly (within two (2) to four (4) weeks) to provide support on tasks of varying duration, complexity, and size; and (f) Located close enough to JPL for cost-effective, frequent interaction. Response should include detailed information on all items listed above. This relationship will only be effective if the potential subcontractor has the necessary expertise and the capability to quickly start and terminate tasks.

<DESC>Document Type:  Presolicitation Notice Solicitation Number:  DE-RP09-05SR22467 Posted Date:  June 3, 2005 Response Date:  June 17, 2005 Classification Code:  A â€“ Research & Development Set Aside:  N/A Contracting Office Address: SRS Road 1A, P. O. Box A, Aiken, SC 29802 Description: The Department of Energyâ€™s (DOE) Savannah River Operations Office (SR) announces the availability of Request for Proposal (RFP) No. DE-RP09-05SR22467 entitled â€œAdvanced Remediation Technologies (ART) expected to be published in draft on or about (June 17, 2005) and in final on or about (July 17, 2005). DOE has identified priority needs in providing technologies for the Hanford and Savannah River sites high level waste streams for enhanced sludge washing (pretreatment) and for improved methods to physically remove residual sludge (tank heel removal), while minimizing the adverse impacts on the remainder of the tank farms due to large volumes of added water or chemical treatments. Advanced technologies to meet these and other high-level waste priority needs will be solicited under this acquisition. The scope of work requires the contractor(s) to conduct the evaluation and development of innovative technologies to support remediation activities for pre-treatment, tank heel removal of radioactive high-level waste streams, and subsurface/groundwater needs at various EM sites.  Pretreatment technologies will focus on methods that could reduce high-level waste program costs; associated with sludge washing sludge heel removal technologies will focus on methods to remove sludge to levels that support final closure and performance assessment criteria; typically to levels of 100-1000 gallons remaining. The subsurface and groundwater cleanup will focus on innovative technologies for characterization, treatment, and monitoring of radionuclides, organics, and metal contamination in the surrounding areas, including in soil, groundwater, and surface water. Sludge Washing Technology for enhanced sludge washing and the leaching process addresses the removal of aluminum from the Hanford HLW sludge using existing and planned tank farm facilities.  Slower reaction rates for some aluminum phases and filtration times for the larger amounts of caustic create a bottleneck in the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) Pretreatment facility. The planned baseline includes construction of waste retrieval facilities (WRF) near the T/TX/TY and B/BX/BY tank farms at Hanford, but does not specify the size or ancillary equipment for those facilities.  The proposals should optimize the use of existing waste storage tanks and identify WRF tanks and infrastructure to provide caustic leaching capability within the tank farms with the objective to eliminate the bottleneck at the WTP Pretreatment facility and accelerate closure. The project is structured into Phase I and Phase II.  In the first phase, the selected vendor(s) will be expected to develop a technical approach, schedule, detailed system design, and a detailed cost estimate for the full-scale sludge washing system at the Hanford site.  Phase I will be performed at the offerorâ€™s site. The demonstration of the selected system in Phase II is planned to be performed at the DOE Hanford Site Richland, WA.  Additionally, the vendor is to provide a detailed cost estimate for the option of additional demonstration testing of the system. While the contractor will perform Phase I at its site, field visits may be necessary to complement the work at the vendorâ€™s site. The demonstration of sludge washing technical approach is expected to conform to the Hanfordâ€™s siteâ€™ s requirements. The selected vendor will demonstrate knowledge of the Hanford site management and operating contractorâ€™s Environmental Safety and Health (ES&H) requirements. Tank Heel Removal Another priority need is to sufficiently clean storage tanks to allow tank closure.  Following bulk sludge retrieval, tank closure at Hanford and SRS cannot occur until residual quantities of sludge are less than the radionuclide source terms for that tankâ€™s performance assessment.   This effort targets improved methods to physically remove residual sludge (tank heels), while minimizing the adverse impacts on the remainder of the tank farms because of large volumes of added water or chemical treatments.  An additional challenge for SRS storage tanks is the highly obstructed tank interior due to cooling coils. Sludge retrieval generally consists of mixing to suspend the sludge solids, while simultaneously pumping the suspended sludge slurry from the tank. When the slurry is pumped below the intake of the mixing pumps, mixing stops and the sludge resettles to the tank bottom.  Subsequent steps may include adding thousands of gallons of additional water to increase the liquid level (3,500 gal/inch), re-starting the mixing pumps, and repeating.  Thousands of gallons of water are required, which subsequently require evaporation or storage in the tank farm.  For example at SRS, processing also assumes use of oxalic acid. An open technical issue or risk exists on the fate of oxalate in the overall material balance.  In theory, improved mechanical means will allow lower oxalic acid use and, therefore, avoid downstream processing constraints. The project is structured into Phase I and Phase II.  In the first phase, the selected vendor(s) will be expected to develop a technical approach, schedule, detailed system design, and a detailed cost estimate for the tank heel removal system at the Hanford or SRS site.  Phase I will be performed at the offerorâ€™s site. The demonstration of the selected system in Phase II is planned to be performed at the DOE site.  Additionally, the vendor is to provide a detailed cost estimate for the option of additional demonstration testing of the system. While the contractor will perform Phase I at its site, field visits may be necessary to complement the work at the vendorâ€™s site. The demonstration of tank heel removal technical approach is expected to conform to the Hanford or SRS siteâ€™s requirements. The selected vendor will demonstrate knowledge of the Hanford site management and operating contractorâ€™s Environmental Safety and Health (ES&H) requirements. Subsurface/Groundwater Remediation Various DOE EM sites seeks to demonstrate and evaluate innovative technologies for characterization and monitoring of radionuclides, metal ions, and other inorganic and organic contaminants for applications at EM closure sites currently under remediation and for post-closure monitoring.  Furthermore, innovative soil and groundwater remediation/treatment technologies are needed to be demonstrated and evaluated for deployment to address the contaminated subsurface HLW tank sites. The project is structured into Phase I and Phase II.  In the first phase, the selected vendor(s) will be expected to develop a technical approach, schedule, detailed system design, and a detailed cost estimate for the characterization and monitoring technologies at a selected DOE site.  Phase I will be performed at the offerorâ€™s site. The demonstration of the selected system in Phase II is planned to be performed at various DOE sites.  Additionally, the vendor is to provide a detailed cost estimate for the option of additional demonstration testing of the system. While the contractor will perform Phase I at its site, field visits may be necessary to complement the work at the vendorâ€™s site. The demonstration of characterization and monitoring technical approach is expected to conform to the siteâ€™s requirements. The selected vendor will demonstrate knowledge of the siteâ€™s management and operating contractorâ€™s Environmental Safety and Health (ES&H) requirements.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. The National Weather Service (NWS) is conducting market research for the replacement of the RF Generator in its NEXRAD Weather Surveillance Radar WSR-88D. The RF Generator is the master signal and timing source within the Radar Data Acquisition subsystem and is functionally contained within the receiver.  The existing RF Generator has a high failure rate and is encountering obsolescence of critical components. The existing RF Generator is P10S331 manufactured by RDL, Inc. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information from radar receiver manufacturers relating to the availability of RF Generators in the commercial market. The following are the salient characteristics of the existing RF Generator. The RF Generator has four RF outputs: RF, STALO, COHO, and RF Test. RF OUTPUT: Freq 2.7 to 3.0 Ghz with 5 Mhz increment selections within the frequency band; Warm up time: 5 minutes from cold start; Accuracy: .0005%; Stability: .0005% over temperature range Oto +50 Deg C; Power output: 11.75 to 14.25dBM. LOCAL OSCILLATOR (STALO): Frequency: 2.6424 to 2.9424 Ghz. STALO shall be 57.5491 Mhz less than the RF Freq. Power output: 14.85 to 17dBM. COHO OUTPUT: Freq: 57.5491 Mhz. Power output: 26 to 28dBM. PHASE CONTROL: The RF output and COHO signal outputs shall be capable of being phase" controlled by means of a 7 bit digitally controlled phase shift device. Range: 0 to 360 degrees nominal in 2.8125 degree nominal increments; Accuracy: +/-2.5 degrees. The phase shall increase monotonically over the phase control range. COHERENCE: All frequency outputs shall be coherent. SPECTRAL PURITY: Harmonics: RF: 2nd harmonic <-50DBc, all others,-70dBc. STALO, COHO: 2nd<-60dBc, all others<-70dBc. Spurious Frequencies: -70dBc within 80 Mhz of carrier, all outputs. Phase Noise: The single sideband FM noise ratio in a 1 Hz bandwidth of the RF and STALO outputs shall be less than -40 dBc at a frequency offset of 10 Hz from the carrier. It should be -80 dBc at a frequency offset of 100 Hz, 110 dBc at a 1 kHz offset, -135 dBc at a 10 kHz offset and -138 dBc at an offset of 100 kHz. The single sideband FM noise ratio in a 1 Hz bandwidth of the COHO output shall be less than -65 dBc at a frequency offset of 10 Hz from the carrier, -105 dBc at a frequency offset of 100 Hz, -135 dBc at a 1 kHz offset, -160 dBc at a 10 kHz offset and -165 dBc at 100 kHz. 

GENERAL: The RF generator replacement should allow for accepting and supplying COHO signals in a digital format for synchronization with digital receiver assemblies. The NWS will not fund the development of a new design to support this requirement.  Responses to this market survey should only include items that support all stated requirements in a current commercially available configuration, or a configuration that could be made fully compliant through minor modifications.  Responses to this market survey must include the device manufacturer, a product description with performance parameters, a statement regarding current availability, a statement describing any required modifications, and the estimated cost of the product including any required modifications.  This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotes. Should the results of this market research indicate feasibility of RF Generator replacement with an existing commercial product; the NWS will consider retrofit options for its nationwide network of 175 RDAs as a potential follow-on product improvement project. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  All information should be submitted to the Michelle A. Sandoval, U.S. Dept. of Commerce/NOAA/MASC, Acquisition Division, MC3, Boulder, CO  80305 no later than June 21, 2005. 
Responses should be received no later then 15 days from the date of this announcement. No telephone calls will be accepted or returned.

<SUBJECT>V -- Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement
<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source procurement under FAR Part 12.203 and FAR Part 13.5 to Omega World Travel to provide commercial travel service at F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming.  The current contract with Omega Travel is currently operating on the final six-month extension, which expires on 30 June 2005.  It was anticipated that the Defense Travel Service (DTS) full and open commercial travel office (CTO) contract would be operational at F. E. Warren AFB by 1 July 2005, and at that time, a task order would be in place against the Defense Commercial Travel Office contract to carry actions associated travel orders, i.e., airline tickets, lodging reservations, etc.  However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the Defense CTO has not been awarded as of this date and no firm date has been identified.  Recent guidance from the DTS Contracting Officer and SAF/AQCK was received to issue a sole source annual order, with two 6-month options, to the current contractor, Omega World Travel, Inc. This action is necessary to provide continuity of services until F.E. Warren AFB is absorbed into DTS, and the DTS CTO contract is awarded.  In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), the Government will negotiate directly with Omega World Travel.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government.  This notice is for information only.  It is neither a request for proposals nor a solicitation for offers.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquiries and concerns must be submitted, in writing, not later than close of business on Tuesday, June 7, 2005.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Development of Part D Medication Measures
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to negotiate and award a special study to the Mississippi Foundation of Medical Care (MFMC) pursuant to the authority FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  As a continuation of previous developmental work, MFMC will develop a limited number of Part D Medication Measures as mandated by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003.  The Part D Measures will be in the areas of drug-drug interaction and duplication of drugs in a therapeutic class that will be used by CMS’s Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) for quality improvement and intervention tasks that are required in their 8th Scope of Work contracts mandated by MMA.  Under a previous special study awarded under MFMC QIO contract with CMS, MFMC developed the Prescription Continuity of Care System (PCCS) which provides the ability to assess and monitor medication used in the elderly so that the findings can be used to improve medication use in this population. MFMC modified the system to use electronic databases to conduct the medication monitoring functions. The PCCS provides evidence-based information regarding instances and types of drug-drug interactions and duplication of drugs in a therapeutic class that occurred in the Medicare population.  The special study will be for a twelve month period of performance.  This notice is a notice of intent to negotiate and award a special study to MFMC and should not be considered a request for proposals.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement that will be considered by the agency.  The statement must demonstrate that the firm(s) has capability to perform the required work.  All capability statements must be submitted via email to Herman L. Harris at HHarris@CMS.hhs.gov  on or before August 3, 2005.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  CMS will not reimburse costs for submission of capability information.  The NAICS code for this action is 923120.   See FedBizOpps Numbered Note 22.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Facilities Operator/Animal Caretaker

Douglas Station Mounted Horse Patrol Unit

The Mounted Horse Patrol Unit of the Douglas Station currently has twenty-one (21) horses assigned to it.  As such, caring for the horses, maintaining the facilities and having agents available for farrier services has become very expensive and taxing on the unit's ability to maintain the maximum number of agents in the field to perform their official duties. Below are some items that have been identified that would facilitate the agent's ability to remain in the field to perform his/her duties in support of the Border Patrol's mission.  Employing a contractor would be more cost effective in maintaining the facility and the horses.  This would allow the agents to dedicate a greater majority of their time in the field by eliminating the requirement to have agents maintain the facility and the horses.

A contractor would be responsible for providing all labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, training, and transportation in order to provide a facility operator/animal caretaker service at the specified site. A contractor would also be responsible for providing a minimum of disability insurance and other benefits, as prescribed by the U.S. Department of Labor, to the employees. A minimum of two (02) operator/caretakers is required to maintain coverage throughout the entire week.  This will also cover for holidays, sick days and vacation time for the contract employees.  

Contract employees would be available during daylight hours in order to facilitate other businesses such as farrier services, veterinary services and other responsibilities as dictated by the unit supervisor.

Facility Operator/Animal Caretaker:

·	Facility operator(s)/animal caretaker(s) must perform all work in person and on-site (individuals will work 8 hours per day/ 7 days per week and be capable of performing services on a "flex-schedule" to accommodate varying horse patrol work shifts)

·	Be physically present for all contracted services being performed (i.e. veterinary, farrier service)

·	Clean/maintain corral area and stalls/tack room/storage area daily (to include feed bins and water troughs, and removal of manure from the premises)

·	Perform tack maintenance to insure that all equipment is clean and serviceable

·	Maintain a daily log of all prescribed services and activities and report any abnormalities to the horse patrol supervisor or agent-in-charge

·	Responsible for cleaning of Horse Patrol Fleet, which includes vehicles and trailers (individual is not authorized to operate patrol vehicles)

·	Feed horses daily (twice) as prescribed by the unit's feeding/nutrition schedule.

·	Groom/wash horses to maintain a clean coat as needed.

·	Treat/clean minor abrasions/galls as needed.

·	Horses not being used for patrol duty will be removed from stalls and put into a designated exercise area.

·	All horses will be returned to their stalls at the end of the day

Note:
(1)	Vendor is responsible for any costs or damages suffered to the Government (i.e. veterinary costs, etc) that is a result of negligence or carelessness of the facility operator/animal caretaker.  The COTR and the Contracting Officer will determine negligence or carelessness on a case-by-case basis.

(2)	Locations may be changed, added or deleted throughout the contract period.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide questions and answers.  All other terms and conditions remain the same.
 

Q1. “Must include finite element analysis capabilities” - We have some confusion about this line item. While the 3D data our system produces can be imported into finite element software, this line could be taken to mean that you with for the vendor to provide not only the capability to export the data, but also the Finite Element analysis software itself (NASTRAN or similar.)  Could you clarify?  If a finite element analysis package is desired (in addition to the ability to export the data as NURB surfaces) is there a particular finite element software that is preferred?  We ask because it is unusual to provide the finite element analysis code in a CT system, but we certainly can buy and install such a package if it is required.

A1.  The Contractor will not be required to provide a stand-alone Finite Element Analysis software package such as NASTRAN.  NIST does expect some built-in image analysis tools, and NIST also needs the ability to export the image data to a generic Finite Element format, such as IGES or NASTRAN.  A simple conversion to an 8-node brick solid representation of the image data would also be acceptable - although this would require some translation on NIST’s part to make it useful for our purposes.

PRINCIPLE STATEMENT OF WORK

(1) The contractor shall provide an overall conceptual engineering design of a research wind tunnel to meet the specifications given.  The contractor shall provide a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) to the AF. Following the PDR, and with AF approval, the contractor shall proceed and complete the design that includes all construction details and notes on drawings.  Upon successful completion of the PDR, the contractor shall submit final engineering drawings to the AF for approval and authorization to proceed (ATP).  The design must comply with all applicable State Codes, City Ordinances, Factory Mutual Insurance Company requirements, and all agencies having jurisdiction over this job.  Any required permits are the responsibility of the contractor.

(2) The contractor shall design and manufacture a research wind tunnel to AF specifications.  The contractor shall provide bi-weekly status reports to the AF focal point and allow AF representatives to visit the contractor at any time to review the design and/or inspect the wind tunnel during its manufacture.  Upon completion of the wind tunnel fabrication, the contractor shall provide as-built drawings.  Bidders shall specify whether an operational checkout at the manufacturing site will be performed.  The contractor shall also provide a written summary of the operational checkout of the wind tunnel (if performed).  The AF or a designated representative will perform a buyoff inspection at the contractor's location prior to shipping.  On AF approval, the contractor shall package and ship the wind tunnel to the installation site in Pomona, California.

(3) The contractor shall install a Northrop Grumman (NG)-type designed model support system onto the new wind tunnel.  The model support system, seen in the Concept Support Picture at http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/, will be constructed under a separate contract and provided to the wind tunnel contractor for installation. The contractor shall mount the model support hardware below the test section.  This system includes a strut that extends up into the test section for mounting test models.  It provides pitch and yaw control of the model.  An Interface Control Drawing (ICD) is shown in the Concept Support Picture at http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/.  It shows the model support hardware installation in the wind tunnel test section.  A NG-designed slotted turntable (45 inch diameter, 1/4 inch thick aluminum disk) will be installed into a circular cutout in the floor of the test section, flush with the tunnel’s floor surface.  The disk turns with the support system for yaw control.  The strut extends through the slotted disk and pivots to give pitch control.  The support system must be positioned and leveled (with respect to the tunnel centerline when installed) so that the center of rotation of the support system coincides with the center of the test section.

(4) The contractor shall install a base to locate the support system vertically.  The base will be attached to the floor below the test section and the support system will be mounted on top of three adjustable leveling feet.  Dimensions of the base are approximately 38 inches wide by 55 inches long by 12 inches high. (The height of the base is dependent upon the distance from the floor to the test section centerline.)  An existing base design is available from NG and will be modified and constructed by another vendor and supplied to the wind tunnel vendor for installation under the test section.

(5) The contractor shall perform functional tests of the new wind tunnel to verify that all specifications are met and make all adjustments or corrections, as required to achieve operation and test section airflow quality within the specification.  Any negative deviation from the specifications must be approved by the AF. To verify the flow quality, the contractor shall perform a detailed calibration of the airflow in the test section of the installed wind tunnel.  This would include two-dimensional mappings (every 2" in the y and z directions normal to the flow direction) of flow velocity, flow angularity in pitch and yaw, and turbulence intensity at 3 (streamwise) stations along the test section: the center of the test section and two other longitudinal stations +/-20" from the first.

(6) The contractor shall provide calibration data to correlate control panel speed setting to test section air velocity for clear test section.

(7) The contractor shall provide a training session for the AF and CPP personnel.  Topics include facility operation, maintenance, servicing, precautions, etc.

(8) The contractor shall provide two complete sets of documentation describing the operation and maintenance of the wind tunnel and all support equipment.

(9) The contractor shall provide printed engineering drawings, 2-D and 3-D in AutoCAD, of the as-built wind tunnel facility on E-size drawings (28" x 40") and electronic drawing files on CD-ROM.  Electronic drawing files shall be provided in both .pdf format as well as AutoCAD or IGES format.

OPTIONAL STATEMENT OF WORK

Contractors shall perform the following tasks that consist of enhancements to the principal statement of work.  

(1) The contractor shall purchase and install a water cooling tower and pump system to provide chilled water to the wind tunnel.  The contractor shall size the system to maintain wind tunnel temperature at ambient +/- 5 degrees F.  Local ambient temperatures range from 50 to 105 degrees F.  It is anticipated that, without cooling, flow temperature will rise by 25 degrees F above ambient during a typical run.  The contractor shall install the tower at an AF approved location near the wind tunnel, make all required hookups (electrical, water, etc.), check out operation and obtain all of the required permits.  

(2) Improve flow quality in the test section from those specified in above (Principle Statement of Work) to - Flow uniformity:  0.25% variation from average velocity or less; Turbulence:  0.07% turbulence intensity or less; Flow angularity:  *0.1 degree variation or less in pitch and yaw (clear test section).

These are maximum values allowed at the array of points specified in the flow calibration of the test section described in the principle statement of work.

To achieve this improved flow quality, it is recommended that Items a - c below be considered.

(a) The contractor shall add two additional screens, after the honeycomb and before the contraction cone to improve flow uniformity in the test section.

(b) The contractor shall add a constant section, of length equal to one effective diameter of the tunnel at that location, between turn 4 and the contraction cone to improve flow quality in the test section.

(c) The contractor shall add corner fillets to all four corners of the test section, with proper fairings upstream and downstream of the test section, to improve flow quality in the test section. Fillets are to be such as to account for growth of the boundary layers on the walls of the test section. Therefore, the test section walls shall be parallel, in pairs.

(3) The contractor shall install lights in the test section fillets, 4 places, to improve lighting in the test section.

(4) The contractor shall provide and install noise reduction equipment (acoustic silencers) inside the wind tunnel to reduce the level of wind tunnel noise. The contractor shall specify the noise level reduction provided by the silencers (dBA) at 100, 200 and 300 ft/sec.

(5) The contractor shall provide automatic controls of wind tunnel parameters including dynamic pressure (q), temperature, model pitch, and model yaw.  Analog voltages will be available from the model support system for pitch and yaw.  The AF will provide the needed programming in LabVIEW.

(6) The contractor shall provide a comparison of costs for alternative wind tunnel construction materials (fiberglass, wood, other) and include a durability warranty extension statement.  The contractor shall make recommendations based on expected operating conditions: moderate climate, dry, windy, direct sunlight (20 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit), earthquake-proof, etc.

(7) The contractor shall provide a motorized 3-D traversing mechanism that will be mounted inside and at the downstream end of the test section and allow for flow measurements throughout most of the test section (for example the detailed calibration of the test section flow, as described on top of page 5).

(8) The contractor shall design the test section to be easily removable, interchangeable and portable and supply one additional removable test sections for 2-D airfoil testing.  Maximum airfoil cord length will be 12” and the mounting will be a single position in the center of the section.

(9) The contractor shall provide computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the flow in the test section and tunnel circuit.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The MOF is a Vietnamese government agency that manages the state’s budget, including the collection of taxes, fees and other revenues.  Its primary responsibilities include managing national reserves, state-owned assets, corporate finances, and state-owned capital at public enterprises.  The MOF supervises Vietnamese government borrowings and debt servicing from within Vietnam and abroad, international grants, management of accounting and auditing procedures, regulation of banks and non-banking financial institutions, provision of financial services, and customs activities.

USTDA has worked with the MOF on the development of a World Bank-funded Treasury and Budget Management Information Systems (TABMIS) project by providing assistance through a feasibility study (USTDA No. 1997-351B) and Orientation Visit (USTDA No. 2004-30002A).  This $45 million project has reached its final procurement phase, and U.S. firms are prominently included in each of the short-listed consortiums.  We have also provided assistance to the VST (under the MOF) for the development of an agency-wide information and communications technology network; this study is nearing completion (USTDA No. 2001-30076B).

There are several development projects that the MOF would like for USTDA to consider.  The first project would build on the work done to date for VST by defining the organization's "Enterprise Architecture."  In particular, the MOF is asking for USTDA to support an activity that would provide a detailed design of VST's architectures for information flow, application processing, data management, and ICT.  This assistance would also identify the institutional and infrastructure upgrades that would need to occur given the imminent implementation of the TABMIS.  

The second project proposal involves the development of a Financial Statistics System.  The MOF is seeking to construct a modern system that will allow it to generate accurate statistical information for making assessments, forecasts, and fiscal plans.  The Vietnamese government's ultimate goal is to have in place by 2010 a complete financial statistics system that follows international standards for Government Financial Statistics (GFS).

The third project would be for technical assistance to establish a Credit Guarantee Fund within the MOF.  

There is a fourth potential project that the DM Contractor shall investigate.  The State Bank of Vietnam is entering into a second phase of a World Bank-funded banking modernization and payment systems project.  Five Vietnamese banks are participating in this $105 million project.  Although a feasibility study was completed by a Spanish firm, the State Bank indicates that additional work would be needed to ensure that the study meets the specific standards are requirements of the Vietnamese government.


 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity.
