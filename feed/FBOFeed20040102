<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA intends to negotiate, on a competitive basis, for the procurement of engineering analysis and navigation support services for the Office of Satellite Operations.  The National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS) operates all of the United States environmental satellites, civil and military, from the Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC), located in Suitland, Maryland.  The civil constellations consist of the Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellites (GOES) and Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES).  The GOES constellation provides continuous, dependable, timely, highly-quality observations of the Western Hemisphere and geosynchronous space environment.  The POES constellation is in polar, sun-synchronous orbits and provides operational coverage of the entire Earth four times a day.  The data gathered from these satellites allows our country’s weather and emergency agencies to monitor weather conditions,  global climate change, verify ozone depletion, and support search and rescue efforts across the globe.  The successful offeror shall be responsible for providing engineering services for GOES and POES constellations in support of real-time operations, spacecraft analysis, navigation operations, engineering configuration management and engineering and operations training.  The estimated level of effort is 27 full-time employees per year.  Evaluation factors will include (1) Technical Approach, (2) Personnel Qualifications, (3) Management Plan, (4) Quality Plan, and (5) Past Performance.

Offerors will also be required to submit information in accordance with the subcontracting plan outline provided on the website and at: http://www.osec.doc.gov/osdbu/Assets/subkoutline.pdf. 
A solicitation will be issued approximately January 15, 2004.

Request for Construction Documents Exhibit Solicitation 
GS-04P-04-CXC-0027
DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors. 
Note: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients. 
Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:


Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary: 

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor's license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.


2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.


3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.


4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor's record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.


The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.


I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Office of the Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the existing Electric, Natural Gas, Water and Wastewater utility systems located at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, a firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to purchase the existing system from the Government and may be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the Government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate, the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The Contractor proposal and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award.  Past Performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.

Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation:  Robins Air Force Base (AFB)
Location: Warner Robins, Georgia
Installation Description:  Robins Air Force Base (AFB) is located in Houston County, east of the City of Warner Robins, approximately 16 miles south of Macon, Georgia.  Robins AFB comprises approximately 8,855 acres and is comprised of approximately l,500 buildings.
Utility systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the systems.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

a.	Electric:
      
Electric power is supplied from GPC through three ll5-kilovolt (kV) transmission lines that feed into the GPC switching station, which then supplies power to the bases two substations.  115 kV power, received from GPC, is reduced to useable 12.47 kV by two 20-megavolt ampere (MVA) GPC power transformers located at each substation.  The on-Base power distribution system is monitored by a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.  The SCADA system will not be transferred under this contract.  At the D Street Substation, the power is distributed to the base through sixteen l5 kV, 1,200 amp General Electric vacuum circuit breakers.  The distribution feeders travel from the substation as underground circuits consisting primarily of 500 MCM copper conductors in concrete encased duct banks, with final load taps being made up with predominantly #2 copper conductors.  At the 9th Street Substation, the power is distributed to the Base through either l5 kV, 1,200 amp General Electric vacuum circuit breakers.  The distribution feeders travel from the substation as underground and overhead circuits.  The underground consists primarily of 500 MCM copper conductors in concrete encased duct banks and final load taps being made up with predominantly #2 copper conductors.  The overhead circuits consist of both aluminum and copper conductors.  The underground circuits on base equate to an approximate three-phase, four-wire circuit equivalence of 223,814 linear feet.  The overhead circuits on base equate to an approximate three-phase, four-wire circuit equivalence of 62,650 linear feet.  

b.	Natural Gas:

The natural gas system at Robins Air Force Base is connected to two high-pressure sources of natural gas.  One is a connection to a gas pipeline owned by Atlanta Gas and Light and the other is a connection to a local distribution company, the City of Warner Robins gas system.  Interruptible gas supply is purchased competitively on short-term contracts.  Firm gas is purchase under a long-term contract with the City.  Natural gas is received from the supplier and reduced to approximately 55 to 60 pounds per square inch gauge (psid).  The City has meters in the distribution system on base for distinguishing between firm and interruptible gas sales.  The base can purchase interruptible gas rather than firm gas because of the completion of a propane/air peaking system.  ERI Services constructed, owns, operates, and maintains the propane air system on the base.  The system is designed to provide 400 MMBTU/hour at peak.  There are six 60,000-gallon propane storage tanks designed to operate at an 80 percent load factor.  The first sections of the gas system were constructed in the l950s.  The original gas system piping consisted of black iron and steel pipe.  Portions of these pipes were abandoned in place and replaced with polyethylene (PE) pipe.  New construction is generally PE pipe.  The distribution system is looped so that in nearly all locations buildings can be fed from at least two different paths.  There are approximately ll9 buildings and 763 housing units connected to the base gas system. The distribution system has 217,000 linear feet of pipe that is a mixture of coated and wrapped steel, black iron, cast iron, and PE piping.  PE pipe comprises approximately 55 percent of the system.  Steel mains range in size from ¾ inch to 8 inches in diameter.  PE mains range in size from 1 to 8 inches in diameter.  Service lines range from ¾ inch to 3 inches in diameter.  The steel piping systems are protected from external corrosion by an impressed current cathodic protection system.  A total of 18 rectifiers are installed throughout the base to protect the gas lines.  These protection systems were installed between l977 and l980.  There are eight “district” regulator stations located on the system.  Seen of these regulator stations reduce the pressure to ~ 35 psig to serve the housing areas.  One station at the northeast corner of the base reduces the pressure to ~ 25 psig.  The stations are typically above grade and protected by concrete block walls or fencing.  The regulator stations have redundant regulators and bypass loops for protection and to allow for continued operation in the event of a regulator failure.   The base ass 65 gas meters for measuring gas use as a basis for charging for reimbursable accounts or for new buildings and energy management purposes.  The City of Warner Robins currently has a high-pressure pipeline that crosses the base, Atlanta Gas Pipeline has a pipeline that crosses the runway and terminates in the central part of the base. 

c.	Potable Water:

The base water distribution system supplies water for residential and industrial on the Main base.  Construction of the water distribution system infrastructure began in the early 1940s.  The water distribution system consists of approximately 96 miles of distribution pipe ranging from ¾ inch to 30 inches in diameter.  Most of the pipe is in the 8 to 12 inch range.  Total water storage capacity is 2.7 million gallons.    The water supply is drawn from seven on-base water wells.  An eighth well exists as part of the Robins West housing development, which is not included in the purchase of this utility.  Water is being drawn from the Bluffton Aquifer and requires minimal, if any, treatment to meet drinking water standards.  Treatment that does occur consists of chlorine injection, fluoridation, lime injection and polyphosphate.  The extraction of groundwater is permitted by the State of Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division as required by the Groundwater Use Act.  The Air Force will retain its Bluffton Aquifer water rights.  The contractor is purchasing the distribution system only.  The water distribution system is comprised of several piping materials, including cast iron, ductile iron, polyvinyl chloride and asbestos cement.  There are 21 water supply booster pump stations.  These booster pumps are assumed dedicated to a facility and therefore not included in the purchase of this utility.  There are also four pump stations associated with the fire protection system, which also are not included in the purchase of this utility.  The water distribution system contains four tanks with a total capacity of 2.5 MG of storage.  The system consists of storage for housing and base facilities.  All elevated storage tanks have cathodic protection.  No cathodic protection exists on any of the distribution lines. 
         
d.	Wastewater:

The sanitary system consists of 1 operating treatment plant and approximately 60 miles of collection pipe, ranging in size from 2 to 30 inches in diameter.  Most of the pipe is in the 4 to 10 inch diameter ranges.  The sanitary collection system is comprised of several different piping materials, including cast iron, asbestos cement, reinforced concrete, vitrified clay, ductile iron, and polyvinyl chloride.  The majority of the collection piping material (approximately 70 percent) is vitrified clay.  Robins AFB is nearing completion of a five year collection pipe improvement program to clean, inspect, and repair the sanitary sewer lines.  Approximately 30 miles of the estimated 43 miles of aging pipe have been cleaned and inspected through this program.   Approximately 180 point repairs have been completed along these sections of pipe.  The repairs were noted as point repairs and also include some repairs made for pipe breaks, independent of the program.  The sanitary sewer treatment facility included in the purchase of the utility has a capacity of 3.3 million gallons per day (mdg).  The treatment facility discharges to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permitted Outfall No. 10, which is then combined with other discharges at a pump station and flows to the Ocmulgee River via a C900, 18 inch diameter pipeline.  This pump station and the sanitary sewer treatment facility serve as a final polishing treatment for the effluent from the Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant No. 1.

DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>1.  Revision (in parenthesis) to Section C.12.2.1 – The Contractor shall provide the COTR with a list of the CEST teams professional training prior to reporting to post.  Records of ongoing training shall also be (available) to the COTR (for review and inspection upon request.) 

2.  Questions and Answers are provided and made a part of this solicitation:

Ref. C-7 - These types of backgrounds are very expensive processes to request, from the standpoint of both time and money for all involved.  We suggest and request that we be permitted to provide evidence of US government suitability determinations for staff like access or security clearance verification in lieu of this requirement.  This would mean the requirement has already been met on a far greater level that could be provided by “private” checks, and would eliminate redundant federal dollars being spent.

Answer:  Contractors must demonstrate how their background checks meet or exceed C.7.1.2.  Discuss the process of conducting your background checks.

Ref. C-8 - If my personnel have already worked the Center on numerous occasions, I am assuming that this would be unnecessary.  Is that assumption safe?

Answer:  Contractor personnel must meet each of the requirements established in Section C.8.  Contractor’s technical proposal must demonstrate that they have obtained prior knowledge, training, and or orientation to meet the requirements of C.12.1.1 and 2. 

Ref. C.10.7 - Is that to mean the Center will not provide parking for the team(s) unless the team pays for parking?

Answer:  Yes.

Ref. C.12.1.1 & 2 -  Same question as C-8 above.

Answer:  Yes, Contractor personnel must meet each of the requirements established in Section C.12.  Contractor’s technical proposal must demonstrate that they have obtained prior knowledge, training, and or orientation to meet the requirements of C.12.1.1 and 2.

Ref. C.12.2.1 -   We perform a significant amount of in-service training.  Notifying the Center upon completion of any of it represents a major administrative burden, let alone within a certain period of time.  Typically, the office here may not even receive the completion form for a couple of weeks.  I am going to request this be waived, but if ever questioned by the COTR, then the records as they are at the time of the request can be faxed at that time.  Will this be acceptable?

Answer:    See revised C.12.2.1

Lastly, may I request an electronic copy of your SF-33 as it will save us having to retype all of the information.

Answer:  We are unable to provide with an electronic copy of the solicitation, due to a lack of capability at this time.

These firms will assist the OST in fulfilling it's requirement to evaluate prospective contractors that will mange Tribal trust funds to be withdrawn (from Government trust), or that will advise a particular Indian Tribe on investing the funds to be withdrawn in order to determine if the prospective contractor has the capability and experience to manage the funds.  Among the elements to be evaluated are: the number of years in business, the performance record for funds management, and the ability to compensate the Tribe if the contractor is found liable for failing to comply with the Tribe's management plan (i.e., its assests, bonding, and insurance).  Interested firms are directed to review 25 CFR 1200.14 and 1200.16 for greater detail of services to be performed.
