THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT.

The purpose of this sources sought announcement is for market research to make an appropriate acquisition decision and to gain knowledge of potential qualified businesses interested and capable of providing the services described below. Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.

Background
In response to widespread wildfires, in 2001 Congress directed the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to establish a Native Plant Materials Development Program to increase the number of native species and seed sources available in the commercial market. In 2015, working with other federal agencies through the Plant Conservation Alliance, the BLM led development of the 2015 National Seed Strategy for Rehabilitation and Restoration. This strategy provides a coordinated approach for federal and non-federal partners working toward effective ecological restoration on public, tribal, state, municipal, and private lands. The first goal of this Strategy is to identify seed needs, seed facilities and understand seed resources and capacities across both the public and private sectors to ensure reliable, commercial availability of genetically appropriate species. An assessment for the Eastern U.S. has been initiated. Conducting a westwide assessment of seed needs, facilities and the capacities of both non-federal and federal sectors is the first step towards achieving Goal 1 of the Strategy.
Scope
In order to identify where and how the BLM should invest, leverage and coordinate its native plant materials development efforts and to achieve the highest return for our investment, the BLM Plant Conservation and Restoration Program needs to understand the native seed needs of all land managing agencies and organizations across the western U.S., as well as the capacity of federal, state, tribal and private sectors to help meet those needs. This assessment requires (1) a careful and systematic inventory of federal, tribal and state agencies and other private land managers using native seed, (2) what species and sources are being used, (3) for those agencies/organizations using native seed- what are the current and future seed needs, (4) what federal, tribal, and private facilities/companies exist to meet this need and
(5)	what is their capacity to meet this need.

This sources sought shall not be considered as a request for quote or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the contractor submission of this sources sought or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this request. No contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement.

Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.

Background
In 2001, Congress directed the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to establish a native plant material program because there were limited native seed sources in the commercial market. Since 2001, the Plant Conservation and Restoration Program has focused on increasing the availability of plant material to encourage a broader variety of species and seed sources are available for purchase from the commercial seed industry. The BLM Plant Conservation and Restoration Program is developing new native seed sources that will improve the effectiveness of federal vegetation management treatments by using seed transfer guidance to target initial seed collections for subsequent commercial seed production (seed increase) as described in the native plant materials development cycle.
https://www.blm.gov/programs/natural-resources/native-plant-communities/native-seed-and-plant-mater ial-development.
Scope
The BLM requires the collection of between 5,000 and 2,000,000 pure live seeds (per collection) of target species in target seed transfer zones across the western U.S. Because of the inherent variability of wildland seed production due to climate and other factors, BLM cannot predict where and when seed ripening will occur on public lands.

The BLM requires both skilled botanists or plant ecologists and field crews. Accurate botanical identifications and detailed attention to implementing established protocols are critical. The skilled botanists/plant ecologists will provide training, oversight and QA/QC of field crews that will identify and scout potential populations for collection, monitor phenology of populations suitable for collection, and perform seed collections using the Bureau of Land Management Technical Protocol for the Collection, Study, and Conservation of Seeds from Native Plant Species for Seeds of Success (Attachment 1). In addition, skilled botanists/plant ecologists or field crews may be tasked with assisting BLM field staff with botanical inventories, vegetation mapping, mapping and monitoring BLM special status plant populations, monitoring revegetation/habitat restoration project success, and assisting BLM field staff with the preparation of project specific NEPA documents as described in the BLM Integrated Vegetation Management Handbook. 
https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/uploads/Media_Library_BLM_Policy_Handbook_H-1740-2.pdf

BLM locations where seed technicians could be stationed include: the continental US and Alaska. Seed collection may be performed in remote and difficult to access sites.

Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.

Background
In response to widespread wildfires, in 2001 Congress directed the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to establish a Native Plant Materials Development Program to increase the number of native species, seed sources available in the commercial market as well as improve the effectiveness of the BLM restoration treatments. Improving seed sources and restoration treatment effectiveness provides a direct benefit to the BLM by reducing the need to reseed projects, expedite revegetation/restoration goals, and allow multiple use activities to return to degraded public lands faster. To develop native species for restoration, BLM follows the Native Plant Materials Development Cycle. Unlike food crops, developing and using native plants for wildland restoration requires an investment in understanding plant ecology, seed biology, propagation and cultivation practices, as well as developing techniques for sowing seed effectively on restoration sites. This understanding is achieved by completing scientific studies and investigations (science delivery) projects for priority native plant species.
Scope
The BLM Plant Conservation and Restoration Program has a requirement for science delivery projects that will improve the effectiveness of federal restoration and vegetation management treatments on public lands. In particular, the BLM has a requirement for projects in four topic areas: (1) Native plant population genetics as related to local adaptation and the performance of native seed sources, including but not limited to the development of seed transfer guidance (2) Native plant interactions, ecology and biology as related to understanding and restoring ecological function, (3) Agronomic development of native plant species for commercial seed production, including but not limited to field cultivation practices and seed increase, and (4) Evaluating methodologies and improving the effectiveness of existing restoration practices and developing new restoration methodologies/treatments to restore degraded public lands. The BLM requires science delivery projects to use traditional research practices and techniques (such as but not limited to, germination studies, laboratory and field studies, common garden studies, and ecological investigations). BLM requires the science delivery projects to be compiled into publically available technical reports and peer reviewed publications. Science delivery projects shall be proposed, planned, developed and implemented by lead investigators with a PhD (or equivalent combination of education and work experience) and publication history that demonstrates the investigator has an in-depth understanding of the topic area and experience using science based strategies to answer questions important to land managers.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

This response time applies to each task order requirement awarded for each Rex Robley VA Medical Center task order requirement. This response time requirement does not apply to any other VISN 9 Medical Center except for the Rex Robley VA Medical Center.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK:

Disciplines and expertise required shall include healthcare design and construction, historic preservation, fire/life safety, architectural, civil engineering, structural engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, fire protection engineering, roofing design, construction inspection, scheduling, AutoCAD/Building Information Modeling (BIM) design, acoustical engineering, lighting engineering, interior design, surveying, geotechnical engineering, environmental engineering, certified industrial hygiene, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical facilities, with additional experience in vertical expansion/integration along with phasing of on-going operations, research facilities, long-term care, mental health and dementia, elevators, and other disciplines and experts with specialized experience.

While these tasks, disciplines, and expertise are needed for performance of task orders, other tasks disciplines and expertise that may be required are site development, architectural, interior design, structural, plumbing, sanitary, HVAC, electrical, equipment, steam generation, steam distribution (outside), solid waste disposal system (including incineration), automatic transport, asbestos abatement, Critical Path Method (CPM), specifications, construction period services, and final bid documents. Expertise with environmental issues such as sustainability, energy modeling, alternative energy application and related items may be required with this contract.

The majority of construction projects, not design, under each foreseeable task order will have an estimated construction cost of $5,000,000.00 or less. 

Contractor employees shall not be considered government employees for any purpose under the foreseeable contract.

INTENT: 

For this MATOC, the Government does intend and expects the most highly qualified firms to be able to perform multiple designs simultaneously, as appropriate. Further, the Government does not intend, nor expect the most highly qualified firms to be able to perform every type of A-E service described in this synopsis. Instead, the government seeks to contract with A-E firms that are experienced and knowledgeable conducting a variety of A-E services in multiple disciplines. Therefore, SDVOSBs of all types that perform A-E services described in this synopsis are encouraged to submit SF 330s. 

For purposes of this synopsis, the term "Offeror" refers to the firm or Joint-Venture firm(s) that submits an SF330 as a result of this synopsis.

SELECTION PROCEDURES: 

This MATOC will be procured in accordance with the Selection of Architect-Engineers Act (40 U.S.C Sections 1101-1104, formerly known as the  Brooks Act,  as implemented by FAR 36.6 and VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 836.6. 

Once the Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) has evaluated the submitted SF330s and past performance information against the attached evaluation factors, the TEB will hold discussions with a minimum of five (5) A-E firms determined most qualified to consider anticipated concepts and compare alternative methods for furnishing services and discuss clarifications needed by the TEB. Some mandatory questions will be provided to each contractor to facilitate anticipated concepts on providing A-E services.

After the discussions are complete, the most qualified firm rankings will be reconsidered by taking into account said discussions. The discussions/interviews will be used to clarify any issues or concerns the TEB may have with the applicable A-E s qualifications. The discussions/interviews may impact SF-330 ratings depending on the information provided, and are to be viewed as an opportunity to clarify parts of the SF-330 submission not an opportunity to receive a new rating while discarding the prior SF-330 evaluation. As a result, the discussions/interviews will not receive a rating. The discussions/interviews will be considered in the overall evaluation of each A-E firm, as appropriate.

After consensus is made by the TEB on the ratings of the firms with which discussions were conducted, the Agency shall select, in order of preference, at least 5 firms that the Agency considers most highly qualified to provide the services required. Selection shall be based on the attached document entitled  S03_Attachment 1   Selection Criteria_01. 

An RFP will be issued to each of the most highly qualified firms. Composite labor rates covering a variety of engineering and engineering support labor categories will be requested within said RFPs. 

Only one set of composite rates per labor category will be negotiated per awarded contract per fiscal year.  Most labor categories will include junior, mid-level, and senior rates.  Separate rates for specific teaming or joint venture partners will not be negotiated.  Task orders awarded during a fiscal year will utilize that fiscal year s rate for the entire duration of the task order. All firms selected as the most highly qualified will be required to provide applicable teaming and/or JV agreements with their response to the RFP.

The CO shall negotiate a contract for A-E services at compensation which the CO determines is fair and reasonable to the Federal Government.

The CO shall attempt to negotiate a contract with the most highly qualified firm(s) selected. If the CO is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with each of the selected firms, the CO shall formally terminate negotiations with the applicable firm and then undertake negotiations with the next most qualified of the selected firms, continuing the process until an agreement is reached. If the CO is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the CO shall select additional firms in order of their competence and qualification and continue negotiations in accordance with this notice until an agreement is reached.

If the composite rates for each labor category is determined to be fair and reasonable, a contract will be awarded to those firms.  The CO reserves the right to initiate negotiations with firms to negotiate specific items.  

ORDERING PROCEDURES: 

General procedures for allocating TOs will be provided with the RFPs that are issued to the most qualified firms. This synopsis is not a solicitation.

After MATOC award, the contracting officer will issue a shortened synopsis requesting a compressed SF-330 package / qualifications package (i.e. 2-3 pages in length) for each identified requirement. The Department of Veterans Affairs will determine which firm is most suitable for each specific requirement, based off the compressed SF-330 package / qualification package, and a solicitation will be issued to the identified firm that is determine most qualified for that specific requirement.

Construction Period Services will be issued as separate task orders or via optional contract line items.

TEAMING/JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS: 

Teaming/Joint Venture Agreements: Each contractor may only receive a maximum of one prime contract award per MATOC.  See Attachment 2   Submission Instructions for more information.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research to advance science on the causes and consequences of drug use and addiction and to apply that knowledge to improve individual and public health. The NIDA Division of Therapeutics and Medical Consequences (DTMC) has a requirement for logistical support for their mission of developing new treatments agents for drug dependence.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) plans to solicit proposals under full and open competition procedures from qualified organizations having the capability to (1) analyze and establish the purity of peptides that are synthesized through a separate NIDA contract, and also of those peptides that are obtained by NIDA for medication development, (2) regularly monitor the stability and purity of these peptides, and (3) to develop and perform assays to analyze and authenticate the purity of various of drugs of abuse in the NIDA drug supply inventory as needed. The prospective offeror must possess the necessary equipment and facilities for this project. Additionally, it must have extensive experience in general purity determination of peptides and in opioid peptides specifically.  Specifically, the project requires the following tasks:</p>
<p>1.	The Contractor must establish the chemical and optical purity of peptides: The Contractor must determine the chemical purity of all assigned peptides by using Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) four systems, High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) two systems, Capillary Electrophoresis (CE), Amino Acid Analyzer (AAA), sequencing, Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS), and/or any other suitable method. The contractor must also analyze peptides for their optical purity by at least one method.</p>
<p>2.	The Contractor must develop highly sensitive analytical methods for peptide analysis, such as LC/MS, CE or other suitable method for assigned number of compounds and determine their peptide contents.</p>
<p>3.	The Contractor must analyze chemical purity and physical &amp; chemical characteristics of required drugs of abuse or related compounds by latest available methods; if methods are not available, develop appropriate analytical methods and then analyze.</p>
<p>4.	The Contractor must monitor the stability of an assigned number of compounds.</p>
<p>5.	The Contractor must monitor the batch to batch variation of assigned number of compounds.</p>
<p>6.	The NIDA Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will select compounds and determine the priority of each task.

This part must be acquired from/repaired by a source(s)specified on a source control or selected item drawing as defined by thecurrent version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing/repair knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from/repair by other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<RESPDATE>051818
<ARCHDATE>06022018
<CONTACT>WADE, SHANNON M.
<DESC>OPSS is responsible for the physical security of SSA facilities, which includes management and maintenance of the existing Perimeter Security Systems and related devices in Durham, NC, at the Social Security Administrations (SSA) Second Support Center (SSC) in the Durham/Research Triangle Park area. 

The complex is rated as a Facility Security Level (FSL) 4 high security building by the Inter-Agency Security Committee (ISC) Standards for Federal Buildings.  A 1 rating is low and a 5 rating is the highest.  The complex consists of one building, a separate utility area, a separate Truck Inspection Point (TIP) and two guard booths.

All trucks and commercial vehicles that will be allowed access to the SSC site must first have their vehicles inspected including the undercarriage of the vehicles.  This is accomplished with the use of an in-ground digital imaging system called an Under Vehicle Inspection System (UVIS) that the vehicles drive over.  As the vehicles pass over the UVIS, it takes a continuous digital picture scan of the entire length of the undercarriage and brings it to a viewing computer monitor where a security guard will inspect the image for prohibited items and explosive devices.

Along with the image of the undercarriage, another part of the system called the "scene camera" takes a picture of the vehicle from eye level as it approaches the inspection point.  The scene camera documents and displays a digital color image of the vehicle that is matched up to the undercarriage image.  Both images are stored in a database in a remote computer called the control unit.

The current UVIS that is in place at the SSC is out of warranty, is no longer supported, has reached its end-of-life, and spare parts are no longer available.  It is time to replace this part and its associated components to maintain an acceptable security posture as mandated by the ISC Standards.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Pitney Bowes Inc, located at 1 Elmcroft Road, Stamford, CT 06926 for the acquisition of maintenance services, software/rate change update and postage meter rental for all Pitney Bowes (PB) mail metering systems currently owned by SSA and any PB mail metering equipment purchased during the course of the contract.  These services are currently obtained through Contract No. SS00-13-60018. NAICS Code 532420, Office Machinery and Equipment Rental and Leasing, Size standard $32.5 Million. Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, The Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

The SSA owned mail metering system components covered are PB manufactured components.  SSA requires maintenance of the systems except for the federal digital postal meters, which SSA rents from PB.  The software/rate change updates are also for the agency owned PB mail metering systems.  

The estimated 1,600 SSA mail sites are located throughout the United States and its territories.  PB is the only vendor with its own nationwide service organization servicing PB equipment and the only supplier of new parts for this equipment.  The agency requires a four hour on site response time for service calls and for the vendor to have the equipment up and running within 24 hours of the initial service call.  There is no other responsible source capable of meeting SSA's stringent service requirements.

<DESC><strong>Description:</strong>
<p><strong>Synopsis:&nbsp; <br /></strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p><strong>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding:</strong> <br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; <br />(2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and <br />(3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Background:&nbsp; <br /></strong>AHRQ established two patient safety resources - (1) Patient Safety Network (PSNet) and (2) Web Morbidity and Mortality (WebM&amp;M) - in 2004. In 2015 AHRQ combined PSNet and WebM&amp;M into one website to streamline the user's experience; the website is now called PSNet. PSNet is a national, web-based resource featuring carefully selected, annotated resources on patient safety for multiple audiences, including health care providers, policymakers, patients, and educators. The current PSNet offers weekly updates of patient safety literature, news, tools, and meetings and a vast set of carefully annotated links to important research and other information on patient safety. PSNet provides powerful searching and browsing capability, as well as the ability for diverse users to customize the resource to their interests, and is supported by a robust patient safety taxonomy and web architecture.</p>
<p>PSNet includes WebM&amp;M, which is a national, web-based learning program for health care providers. WebM&amp;M relies on user-submitted reports of near misses, medical errors, and patient harm/injury associated with or that are the direct result of health care delivery. WebM&amp;M content includes user-submitted cases of medical errors, expert commentaries, and perspectives on patient safety.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives:<br /></strong>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is looking for firms which have the capability to: (1) Serve as a coordinating agent and national link to relevant domestic and international, public and private sector, patient safety resources and information; <br />(2) Maintain, monitor, and enhance a national, Web-based learning program for health care providers that relies on reports of near misses, medical errors, and patient harm/injury associated with or the direct result of health care delivery; <br />(3) Advance learning about patient safety by providing downloadable slide sets based on a monthly WebM&amp;M case and offering CME/CEU credits, etc., as appropriate for selected categories of professionals and trainees; <br />(4) Develop and maintain appropriate partnerships to enhance and expand content availability.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Requirements:<br /></strong><strong><br />Task 1: Develop Web Platform that Houses PSNET and WEB M&amp;M</strong><br />The contractor shall develop a new website to host PSNet that meets the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum M-16-21 "Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software". The website must also be hosted at an AHRQ facility or by a Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) compliant cloud service provider (CSP) and shall adhere to the requirements of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014.</p>
<p>The website shall have the same functionality as the current website (https://psnet.ahrq.gov/) to the extent possible given the new Federal and HHS source Code policies. For example, the website shall organize the content by major categories such as Primers, Perspectives, Web M&amp;M, etc. The website shall have a search function so that users can search on any topic to find relevant content and all content shall be tagged with key words to facilitate easy searching. Individuals accessing the website shall be able to customize the content that shows up on the website given their preferences for certain topics. Individuals accessing content that provides continuing education credits (CE) shall be able to register to get the CE and be able to track CE credits earned.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once the contract is awarded, the contractor will receive any available source code and/or data files that were developed on behalf of AHRQ along with any installation or maintenance instructions (including an inventory of objects and modules that constitute the PSNet website).

<SUBJECT>In Vitro Affinity-based Diagnostic System for Diseases Resulting from Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Exposure
<SOLNBR>W911QY18S0007
<RESPDATE>062218
<CONTACT>Richard Totten, Phone 3016192446, Email richard.w.totten2.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>In Vitro Affinity-based Diagnostic System for Diseases Resulting from Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Exposure</p>
<p>Objective: This is a Second Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI. The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (Medical Countermeasures Systems) is seeking information on the capabilities and willingness of private entities (academic, non-profit and commercial) in the areas listed below.</p>
<p>Briefly, the Medical Countermeasure Systems - Joint Product Lead for Diagnostics (MCS-DX) seeks responses that will inform future investments in diagnostics to complement current and planned polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based capabilities. Technologies should enable clinically-relevant diagnosis of chemical, biological, or radiological (CBR) warfare agent intoxication or infection at early points in disease progression. Of additional interest are systems that leverage or integrate with routine, non-CBR, healthcare capabilities to favor broader adoption across the services and enhance force readiness.</p>
<p>Background: <br />MCS-DX is responsible for the development, acquisition, and sustainment of FDA-cleared diagnostic devices intended for use by Service Members in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of exposure to CBR agents. Currently, MCS-DX is fielding a molecular assay (PCR) system for diagnosis of infection with a limited set of biological threats. However, there are instances where the molecular pathology of disease suggests PCR is not an effective methodology. Such a situation may arise with biological threats early in infection or with organisms that become compartmentalized and sequestered (e.g. in abscesses of internal organs) from easily accessible sample types. MCS-DX desires information regarding systems, and their components, that may address those instances.</p>
<p>Traditional and non-traditional defense contractors, including companies new to working with the DoD, are encouraged to respond. Companies currently in the U.S. domestic healthcare market, or considering entry into the FDA-cleared diagnostics market, are especially encouraged to respond. Respondents are invited to provide information related to their capabilities to fulfill any portion of the requirements listed below. Companies with an enabling technology that may serve as a component within a diagnostic system (e.g. clinical sample collection and preservation, sample preparation, assay designs, etc.) are encouraged to respond.</p>
<p>All proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government Security Classification markings.</p>
<p>Concept of Employment and Operational Environment</p>
<p>Capabilities developed and fielded by MCS-DX are intended for use by a variety of U.S. personnel in a range of deployed locations. A combat medic or physician assistant on the frontline may need to perform diagnostics in a fairly uncontrolled environment, such as a Battalion Aid Station tent. Further from the frontline, yet still "in theatre", a dedicated laboratory technician of a 50-bed combat support hospital may need to perform diagnostics of all levels of complexity in a controlled operational environment, not unlike many Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratories.</p>
<p>Service Members are evacuated through this combat health support system depending on severity of illness and assessed ability to return to duty. As such, clinical sampling and field diagnostic testing is likely to occur between 0 and 168 hours after acute symptom onset. Additionally, CBR diagnostics are used in parallel with, and are subservient to, routine combat casualty care (i.e., trauma and endemic disease medical countermeasures). Thus, it is highly desired for CBR diagnostic capabilities to leverage routine, non-CBR health care capabilities such as clinical chemistry tests, endemic infectious disease tests, traumatic brain injury screening, and specific or non-specific insult/injury host-response.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) currently operates multiplex-PCR diagnostics in the controlled laboratory environment mentioned above and expects to deploy additional PCR-based, CBR diagnostic capabilities closer to the combat frontline by 2022. Any new capabilities must complement the existing diagnostics family of systems to improve patient health outcomes and force health decisions.</p>
<p>Requirements: <br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit information on the availability or developmental status of affinity-based systems, or other alternatives to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based systems, for diagnosis of intoxication or infection with CBR warfare agents. Responses will inform market research for the advanced development, procurement, fielding, and sustainment of a reusable, lightweight, low-complexity, in vitro diagnostic (IVD) capability.</p>
<p>1. MCS-DX is interested in a reusable, multiplex diagnostic platform with application to CBR threats including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>a. Intracellular bacterial pathogen infection: Brucellosis (Brucella spp.), epidemic typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii), Q Fever (Coxiella burnetii), Melioidosis (Burkholderia spp.), and syndromic near-neighbors for which a differential diagnostic impacts clinical treatment course<br />b. Viruses: Encephalitic alphaviruses (Eastern, Western, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus) <br />c. Biological toxins: botulism (botulinum toxin), ricin, food poisoning (staphylococcal enterotoxin B; SEB), Anthrax (Bacillus anthracis)<br />d. Non-specific viral vs. bacterial screening<br />e. External gamma radiation exposure testing (&gt;6 Gy) and triage screening (&gt;2 Gy)</p>
<p>2. Diagnostic Targets: Agent-derived or host-response biomarkers are acceptable for each disease.</p>
<p>3. Clinical Sample Types: Non-invasive or minimally invasive sample types consistent with collection and analyses in austere environments (e.g., capillary whole blood, venous whole blood, saliva, urine, sputum, stool, exudates, etc.).</p>
<p>4. Data and Communications: HIPAA-compliant communications and data processing tools supporting remote data analysis/interpretation of point-of-care sample analyses, if applicable, should be described.</p>
<p>5. Time to Result: Rapid sample-to-answer protocol is highly desired - if greater than 120 minutes, please explain why this is the state of the art for the threat/application. Rapid protocols support administration of appropriate clinical treatment at earlier points in disease progression.</p>
<p>6. Ease-of-Use: Moderate complexity to CLIA-waived - if highly complex please explain why this is the state of the art for the threat/application.</p>
<p>7. Product Maturity: FDA-cleared IVD or sufficiently mature to begin clinical trials no later than 2023.</p>
<p>8. Other Considerations: Safety features for use with BSL 4 agents, including limited user exposure to contaminated sample and minimized risk of aerosolizing sample materials, are desirable. Additionally, support of 3rd-party components through open architecture assay or device design, as well as non-proprietary file formats, is advantageous for integration across Services and should be described.</p>
<p>Performance Objectives: <br />In fewer than 10 pages (single-sided; not including cover page and cover letter), respondents are encouraged to address the above desired characteristics and the below informative details:<br />&bull; Total system weight and dimensions - inclusive of instrumentation and consumables <br />&bull; Ability to process multiple clinical sample matrices relevant to disease status<br />&bull; Assay methodology (e.g. sample preparation, performance steps, detection and analysis methods)<br />&bull; Applicability of system to other morbidities of military relevance (e.g. traumatic brain injury, infectious disease, or cardiac care)<br />&bull; Other commercial assays (in development or currently available), on the described system, that address a DoD routine healthcare capability<br />&bull; Relevant efforts in the discovery pipeline (e.g. antibody, antigen, or biomarker identification efforts)<br />&bull; Synopsis of any relevant experience with the regulatory approval process, including providing capabilities under Emergency Use Authorization<br />&bull; Description of IVD applications under development with the proposed system <br />&bull; Existing or emerging FDA regulatory framework to support development and 510(k) clearance/PMA approval<br />&bull; Assay storage requirements - study-demonstrated (e.g. room temperature, refrigerated, frozen) <br />&bull; Shelf-life extent - supported by current Good Manufacturing Practices stability studies.<br />&bull; Manufacturing capabilities - system or kit production rates; COTS or outsourced component availability <br />&bull; Estimated cost per test - clearly explain plexity (per sample, per target, per run, etc.)<br />&bull; Alignment with planned technology transitions between academia, industry, government<br />&bull; Associated intellectual property rights or patent coverage <br />&bull; Willingness to enter into agreements with the DoD utilizing the medical countermeasures Other Transaction Authority (OTA) via membership in the MCDC (www.medcbrn.org)</p>
<p>Administration: The Government will retain comments and information received in response to this RFI. Proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government security classification markings. All written responses must be received by 4:00 pm on 22 June 2018. Responses should be sent by e-mail to: usarmy.detrick.jpeo-cbd.mbx.mcs-rfi@mail.mil with Subject line of Responding Organization Name and RFI Title. Please direct any questions to the same address. The Point of contact for this RFI is Mr. Barry Sayer, (301)619-2709. Material that is advertisement only in nature is not desired. If a solicitation is subsequently released based on the responses to this RFI the first choice for an acquisition vehicle, if appropriate, will be the Medical CBRN Defense Consortium (MCDC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA). Respondents not already members of the consortium are encouraged to join at www.medcbrn.org. Respondents may also inquire about the MCDC at mcdc@ati.org.</p>

Description of Services
VA Palo Alto Health Care System has a requirement to repair and maintenance of Automatic Fire Sprinkler System.
SCOPE:  In order to meet both VHA Mandate, automatic fire sprinkler systems are required to be inspected, tested and maintained in accordance with NFPA 25, Standard for the Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems and for VHA Directive compliance, NFPA 101 and NFPA 25.
BACKGROUND:  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) acts as its own building and fire protection official and Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). Construction of facilities on Federal property is generally exempt from the requirements of local building codes and standards. In addition, construction projects on Federal property are generally exempt from code compliance reviews by local fire officials. Therefore, VA must have its own process to ensure that facilities are designed, renovated, and constructed in accordance with VA policy and the codes and standards adopted by VA.
VA is required to comply with national consensus codes and standards. VA general requirements addressing construction codes and standards are found in the Office of Construction and Facilities Management (OCFM) document Program Guide (PG) 18-3, Topic 1, Codes, Standards, and Executive Orders. Specific VA requirements for fire protection are found in the VA Fire Protection Design Manual.
The Government requests that interested parties provide the following capability information to the Contract Specialist, Olivia Duarte by e-mail at: olivia.duarte@va.gov  by close of business May 15, 2018:

(c) SAM record
(d)DUNS number
(e) Ability and experience with similar projects. 
(f) List of projects similar in scope.
The Government will use this information when determining its business type decision.  
This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government and no contract will be awarded as a direct result of this Sources Sought announcement.

<DESC>NASA/HQ has a requirement for an independent body of scientific scholars, researchers and physicians to study and evaluate emerging issues of national importance relating to medical policy and oversight for NASA. This independent body will, over time, organize ongoing discussions, take on specific tasks, and possibly issue reports on a variety of issues of importance to NASA's Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer.
<p>NASA/HQ intends to procure these services from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Research Council based on the objectivity and expertise that the NAS provides. NAS is the only organization that is able, through its self-perpetuating, elected membership, to consistently command the services of the nation's foremost scholars and researchers. The NAS employs rigorous and independent review processes that further guarantee the quality and integrity of its studies and reports. On this basis, the NAS is the only entity that can provide the required services to NASA. The resultant contract period of performance will be up to 10 years.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00pm local time on&nbsp;May 25, 2018. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html</p>
