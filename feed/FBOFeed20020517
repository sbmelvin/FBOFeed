<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) intends to enter into sole source negotiations with Information Operations, Inc., a subsidiary of InfoAssure, Inc. for the development of a collaboration security subsystem for the Defense Collaboration Tool Suite (DCTS).  The Collaboration Management Office (CMO) resides in the Advanced Information Systems Joint Program Office and is charged with the fielding, sustainment, and life-cycle management of the Defense Collaboration Tool Suite (DCTS).  DCTS provides combatant commands, services, and defense agencies, interoperable, real-time and asynchronous collaboration capability including voice and video conferencing, document and application sharing, instant messaging, and whiteboard capability in support of defense planning.  The CMO must identify, field and sustain an evolving standard collaboration toolkit that bridges between Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community.  The system must enhance simultaneous, ad hoc crisis and deliberate continuous operational action planning across operational theaters and other domains that provide operational units and defense organizations with simultaneous access to real-time operational, tactical, and administrative planning information.  This requirement addresses the DCTS requirement for security hardening.  
 
Specifically, this effort requires Information Operations, Inc. to configure, test and deliver a collaboration security subsystem for the DCTS.  The contractor shall provide engineering, technical, support, and management expertise required to develop, deliver and demonstrate the collaboration security system.  This shall result in a demonstrated capability that can be operationalized as a component of DCTS.  This prototype shall include all hardware, software, and licenses required to support at least 50 users.  The contractor shall provide post delivery engineering support.  This support shall include, but not be limited to, answering technical questions regarding the design of the Collaboration Security Subsystem, providing troubleshooting support, and providing configuration support.

Information Operations, Inc. is the only vendor that has a role based access control and Defense In Depth security solution for an interactive collaboration application environment.  This Defense In Depth solution protects objects and files as well as systems and networks.  Information Operations, Inc. operationalized this architecture in the USCENTCOM J2 CENTRIX architecture for coalition information dissemination and has unique experience developing the solution through prior work in developing the ODYSSEY virtual private network security architecture for DISA.  The architecture demonstrated interoperability with NetMeeting, a key component of DCTS.  Information Operations, Inc. is the only provider with a Defense In Depth system currently undergoing National Information Assurance Program (NIAP) certification.  This unique product works in a coalition environment, as required for DCTS.  This is the only solution that satisfies the DCTS requirement for a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN), Internet Protocol security protection at the desktop/laptop level, with strong object-oriented, role-based confidentiality.

The Government intends to acquire this service using FAR Part 12 and 13.5.  This solicitation is for notification of intent to award a sole source contract and does not constitute a request for proposal (RFP).  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  No award will be made on the basis of any responses to this advertisement.  No solicitation will be forthcoming.  No telephonic responses will be accepted.  No additional synopsis will be issued.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the Government's requirement by 4 June 2002 or 15 days following the publication of this notice no later than 2:00 PM to Constance D. Fortune, AQN2, Fax (703) 681-0346, or email: fortunec@ncr.disa.mil.  Anticipated award date is no later than 12 June 2002.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for research to study the effect of microwave generated weakly ionized gases (WIG plasmas) on supersonic/hypersonic aerodynamics and on the enhancement of supersonic combustion. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the study from Old Dominion University Research Foundation (ODURF) which is the only responsible source and no other source will satisfy the agency requirements. This requirement is a continuation of an initial study of plasma aerodynamics.  As such, ODURF has accumulated unique and specialized experience and knowlege in the subject. Consequently, it would take substantial duplication of time and money for another source to duplicate and to continue the research and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 31, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Air Vehicles Directorate, Aeronautical Sciences Division, Computational Sciences Branch (AFRL/VAAC) solicits research proposals for the Geometry and Grid Modeling for Numerical Simulation Program.  The goal of this effort is to build upon an existing informal national consortium formed to promote the acceptance and use of modular mesh generation software.  This effort will identify and establish software standards that enable integration and interoperation of individual grid generation modules.  It will also consider development and application of such modules in overall grid generation frameworks suitable for conducting engineering analyses, such as computational fluid dynamics.  Emphasis is placed on software programming language interoperability, application interfaces, standards definitions and the modules themselves, in contrast to complete grid generation packages.  Example modules include, but are not limited to, geometry model inspection/repair, surface meshing, volume meshing, and mesh smoothing.  Software modules created by commercial parties will be considered provided they conform to the standards established in this effort.  Feedback is solicited for the existing preliminary consortium module standards (to be provided) and how these standards may be improved or enhanced.  Ideas are strongly encouraged for coordination of this effort with other collaborative projects related to component software for preprocessing and engineering analysis.  Interested offerors may view and/or download the full PRDA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov/. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

<DESC>Expeditionary Warfare and Coastal Operations
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station (COASTSYSTA) conducts research and development of techniques and technologies directed toward operations in a littoral environment in support of expeditionary warfare and coastal operations. The station's mission includes mine warfare (both mine countermeasures (MCM) and mining), amphibious warfare, diving and life support, special warfare, and other missions conducted in the coastal region. Within these mission areas, the Station is responsible for the full spectrum of research, development and acquisition, and support functions. Typical functions include fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; and development of operational concepts and tactics. The COASTSYSTA is interested in receiving proposals for research and development in all of its mission areas. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)2. It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of two years from the date of publication. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: (1) environmental data collection, monitoring, analysis, or display; (2) multifunction underwater sensing designs and technology; (3) image and sensor data processing; (4) modeling and simulation; (5) innovative conventional and non-conventional MCM, amphibious warfare, naval mining, diving or special warfare techniques (and systems) for application in all phases of the battle timeline including surveillance, targeting, acquisition, and terminal phases; (6) shipboard MCM system modular integration concepts; (7) innovative and non conventional concepts for application of technology, engineering and systems to all phases of coastal operations and coastal warfare; (8) lasers, radar, millimeter wave, or other high energy sensor/weapon; (9)communications and data transmission of any type; (10) concepts and systems for remote control of sea mines; (11) autonomous and remotely controlled vehicles: air, surface, sea surface, undersea or ground; (12) information processing, fusion, and display; (13) sonar data fusion/correlation for mine warfare applications involving methodologies to translate/correlate data between different acoustic sensors/frequencies so that data/images taken with one sensor can be translated into equivalent data/images with another system.   
Proposals may be submitted by any commercial firm, Institution of higher education (other than federal government) with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such entities. The COASTSYSTA encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities.
The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals. Typically each proposal may be: (1) funded incrementally for periods up to three years subject to the availability of appropriations; (2) on average, be funded between $10,000 to $1,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic (although the COASTSYSTA reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic; (4) the COASTSYSTA is not interested in concepts that already have been developed or proven (even if they never have been sold before); (5) the COASTSYSTA seeks proposals for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; and (6) deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation rather than focus on a specific system or hardware solution. Proposals for evolutionary engineering of improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and are not allowed. In orderto minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as an initial step, interested parties should submit concept or "white" papers briefly summarizing the technical direction, relevance and scope of the proposed effort, and a brief synopsis of qualifications based on accomplishments, and provide a rough order of magnitude cost. White papers should be no more than 5-7 pages in length. White papers (and any resulting proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential naval relevance and contributions of the effort to the COASTSYSTSA's specific mission areas; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to COASTSYSTA programs are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered to the COASTSYSTA with unrestricted (Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; (6) Realism of the proposed cost and the availability of funds. Based on evaluation of the White papers, participants may be selected and invited to submit full technical and cost proposals for evaluation by the COASTSYSTA using the above noted evaluation criteria. An invitation to submit a full proposal does not guarantee funding. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED.

If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award." If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, including any existing grant; (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award a contract to Data Computer Corporation of America (DCCA) on a sole source basis using the Federal Supply Service Information Technology Schedule.  CMS maintains an enrollment database (EDB) containing records of all beneficiaries ever entitled to Medicare.  The EDB contains beneficiary identifying information, Medicare Part A and B entitlement dates, demographic data information, Medicare managed care enrollment information, direct billing information, third party payer information, and data identifying the reason for Medicare entitlement.  The implementation of the new Direct Billing System (DBS) was effective August 30, 1996.  As part of that redesign, the EDB began housing data for those beneficiaries who are being directly billed.  Current efforts will build on the EDB to satisfy additional user requirements and legislative requirements for enrollment, entitlement and direct billing processes.  In addition, efforts to streamline those processes and provide support for other DBS applications will be done simultaneously.  DCCA is currently providing routine maintenance support and the continued updating support of the ongoing operational functionalities of the Enrollment Database, Direct Billing System and Third Party System to accommodate legislative and regulatory changes.  DCCA has begun to convert the large EDB from a Model 204 environment to a DB2 environment. This contract will be awarded on a sole source basis, using the Federal Supply Service Information Technology Schedule, to DCCA as they have been solely responsible for the conversion since June 2001. The contract will also include maintenance support for all of the current M204 systems of this database and the conversion of those systems.  This contract will be awarded for a period of 26 months.  Contracting for the conversion and maintenance services is an interim strategy not expected to exceed July 31, 2004. It is being done to ensure maximum results in the development and integration of these two databases, to ultimately form one, until the MBD2 is complete and fully implemented.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to procure a 3 dimensional (3-D)Fused Deposition Modeling Fabricator (FDM Titan Modeler) to create 3-D models made of polycarbonate or polyphenylsulfone materials. Metal castings of models will not satisfy this requirement. The modeling fabricator will be used at NASA LaRC to create models. This procurement will include three (3) one-year option periods for maintenance support of the fabricator and related software. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)under FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Stratasys,Inc., which is the only responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy the agency requirements.  Only the FDM Titan Modeler uses polycarbonate and polyphenylsulfone materials to create 3-D models, no other company manufactures a system that creates models using polycarbonate or polyphenylsulfone materials.  The FDM Titan Modeler machine uses unique, patented technologies that have not been licensed to any other manufacturer  Although other manufacturers have processes for producing models using other materials such as cast metals (aluminum, and copper), acrylic polymers or wax, there is no other machine that uses polycarbonate material to develop the type of models NASA LaRC requires.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 28, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The United States Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for a time and materials  purchase order with Perrin Quarles Associates, Inc. of Charlottesville, VA for development of a revised Acid Rain Program Policy Manual.  Title IV of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7651), authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency to establish an Acid Rain Program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition.  The agency is also in the process of establishing a NOx Budget  Program in Part 96 and 97.  Both Title IV and the NOx Budget Program require all affected utility units to monitor emissions using continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) under Part 75.  The data quality from each CEMS is dependent on the effectiveness of the quality assurance and quality  control program (QA/QC) required by 40 CFR 75, Appendix B, at each individual site.  To assure consistency in the QC/QA programs, EPA needs to publish guidance to sources so the agency personnel, state personnel, and the sources will understand how to apply the Part 75 rules.  This manual will  serve as this guidance.  Perrin Quarles Associates, Inc has extensive experience with the Acid Rain Policy Manual and revisions to the Part 75 rule.  Therefore, Perrin Quarles Associates, Inc. will provide the most timely, cost-effective means of completing this project.  This notice of intent is  not a request for quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION CBD  244 Needy Road, Martinsburg, West Virginia
This requirement is for the procurement of a construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the renovation of the 244 Needy Road Federal Office Building in Martinsburg, West Virginia. The existing facility is approximately 150,00 gross square feet on two floors (110,000 sf on the first floor and 40,000 sf at grade in the floor below).  The project is a multi-phased renovation of the building with Government occupancy throughout the entire renovation project. The work shall include, tenant improvements of the interior office space, HVAC, plumbing, and electrical upgrades. There will be limited exterior work, which will include the addition of windows and skylights
    	
The successful firm must have previous experience with projects of similar size and scope.  The Government has defined similar projects as:	(1)  Renovation of an occupied office building (Governmental, Courthouse or Institutional) of at least 5 million dollars or greater and at least 50,000 square feet of traditional bid/build contracts. Or (2)  New construction of office building (Governmental, Courthouse, or Institutional) of at least 5 million dollars or greater and at least 50,000 square feet of traditional bid/build contracts.

The contractor's personnel shall be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  The estimated cost of this project is between $5 million and $10 million.  The approximate duration of the contract is 18 months, and is expected to begin approximately October, 2002.  Award will be a firm fixed price contract, and the procurement method shall be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures, as identified in FAR PART 15.3, shall be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit, and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.

The acquisition process shall consist of five phases: Phase 1- Receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing the technical evaluation criteria; Phase 2 - Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms; Phase 3 - GSA shall advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether it is likely or not to be a viable competitor in the next phase, based on the technical evaluation in Phase 1. GSA shall inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3- Receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents, which shall be issued to offerors approximately August, 2002.  A competitive range shall be developed by the Contracting Officer.  Phase 4 - Oral presentations and interviews of firms in the competitive range may be required; and Phase 5 - Upon completion of negotiations, receive and evaluate final offers.  A formal selection of a firm shall be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude them from further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 4, without negotiations.  

The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1. Past Performance on similar contracts; 2. Project Management and Staffing, and 3. Subcontracting.  For subcontracting, general contractors will be required to submit three subcontractors for each of the following trades: Mechanical, Electrical, and Skylights.

B ? Jordan:  Airspace Modernization Plan Feasibility Study 

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Jordan:  Airspace Modernization Plan Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for an airspace modernization plan for the country of Jordan.

Because of its location, Jordan receives a fairly substantial volume of overflights crossing the Middle East region traveling to Europe, the Persian Gulf, Africa, the Indian Ocean, and Asia.  Modernizing Jordan?s existing airspace system to better track these overflights would improve Jordan?s position with respect to neighboring countries as a regional air navigation and safety hub.  It would also greatly enhance the planned liberalization and privatization of the country?s civil aviation sector by allowing the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to become an independent and self-sustaining entity through improved collection of overflight fees.

The existing regional airspace is largely uncoordinated and employs widely varying technology systems operating independently in Syria, Lebanon, Israel-Mediterranean, and northern Saudi Arabia.  A modernized Communications Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) system in Jordan is critical for the establishment of an integrated and efficient Middle East regional airspace system, which the region currently lacks.  Additionally, such a system will help to ensure harmonization and coordination of the entire Middle East Airspace Corridor.  Furthermore, the CNS/ATM project fits into Jordan?s goal of becoming a major IT, tourism, and service hub for the Middle East.

The objective of this study is to assist the CAA in developing an airspace modernization plan.  The study tasks are summarized as follows:  1) pre-planning and system assessments, 2) initial operational evaluation of the current Jordanian airspace system, 3) develop initial framework for a Jordanian airspace modernization plan, 4) recommendations for improvements to Jordanian airports/terminal areas for safety, efficiency and quality of service, 5) recommendations for improvements to Amman flight information region (FIR) air route structure for safety, efficiency and quality of service, 6) identification of needed CNS/ATM enhancement to support airspace operational improvements, 7) strategy development to improve efficiency and safety of joint use airspace and special use airspace (SUA) operations, 8) assessment of operation staffing, systems capacity and human resource issues, 9) environmental overview, 10) development of funding options, and 11) development of a final Jordan airspace modernization plan. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $350,020 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., Monday, July 1, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) seeks offers from industry for the commercial development and/or use of the International Space Station (ISS). The content of these offers need not be limited to engineering or research endeavors and may encompass a wide range of viable products and services developed as a result of the unique characteristics of the ISS and its supporting infrastructure, including the Shuttle. Proposed products or services could include the augmentation of the existing baseline space station system.  Prospective agreements will not be contracts or other agreements involving the payment of NASA funds to the partner. Currently, no public funds have been or are anticipated to be appropriated to NASA for allocation to these public-private partnerships. NASA anticipates that the entrepreneurial offers and partnership arrangements will be unique, with the specific responsibilities of NASA and the partner to be negotiated in a Space Act Agreement. Successful partnership offers will involve the creation of new products and services related to the ISS flight or ground segments.  A wide range of partnership terms and conditions may be possible in cases where there is significant private investment and a clear public benefit. As both the need and situation warrants, NASA will provide selected partners the necessary access to NASA facilities, personnel and technical information. The commercial partner will be expected to bear the costs of transportation, on-orbit payload accommodations and resources. However, NASA has received statutory authority to waive all or part of these costs in the near term where there is strong potential that a particular commercial ISS activity will become self-sustaining.  Written offers will be evaluated and selected based on their overall value to the public, and to NASA, consistent with the evaluation factors found at the web site referenced below. Offerors will be responsible for financing their contributions to the partnership with NASA. To the extent proposed financing arrangements utilize innovative mechanisms, such as public service sponsorships, consideration of such offers may involve policy issues requiring review and concurrence of NASA and other Government entities. NASA intends to update and reissue this notice biannually. Therefore, there is no specific due date for offers associated with this broad announcement. NASA may conduct separate and parallel negotiations with multiple offerors. NASA may select none or one or more offers for a formal agreement. Submittal instructions and related information can be obtained at the following web site: "commercial.nasa.gov".

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The New Bangkok International Airport Company Limited (NBIAC) invites submissions of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Airport Security Equipment and Systems project.  NBIAC is interested in identifying its security requirements and developing financing details for the Second Bangkok International Airport.

The tasks that would be completed by the U.S. firm for the project would include: (1) reviewing the operations of airport terminals and airfields, (2) developing specific requirements for security systems, (3) developing capital cost and investment requirements, (4) developing financing options,  (5) assessing training requirements, (6) developing tender documents, and (7) providing a final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $250,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, July 1, 2002 at the above address in Thailand.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<SUBJECT>A -- Adaptive Focal Plane Array
<SOLNBR>BAA02-20
<RESPDATE>070202
<ARCHDATE>07022003
<CONTACT>John Carrano, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-696-2206, Email none
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of adaptive focal plane arrays for use in a variety of military platforms.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in infrared imaging and sensing.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION The overall goal of the Adaptive Focal Plane Array (AFPA) program is to demonstrate a high-performance focal plane array (FPA) that is widely tunable across the relevant wavebands in the infrared (IR) spectrum (including the short wave infrared (SWIR), mid wave infrared (MWIR), and long wave infrared (LWIR) bands), thus enabling "multispectral imaging on a chip."  The FPA should be electrically tunable on a pixel-by-pixel basis, thus enabling the real-time reconfiguration of the array to maximize either spectral coverage or spatial resolution.  The goal is for the FPA to not simply be multi-functional, but rather to be adaptable by means of electronic control at each pixel.  Thus, the FPA will serve as an intelligent front-end to an optoelectronic microsystem.  The primary objective of the AFPA program is, therefore, to develop an electro-optical imaging sensor that benefits from both hyperspectral and forward looking infrared (FLIR) characteristics while avoiding the large mass of hyperspectral and the poor signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) of FLIR.  A FPA is envisioned that employs an active filtering mechanism of some design in each pixel to provide spectral tuning and scene sampling with temporal and spatial simultaneity.  DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  I.  Novel Tunable Detector Design and Fabrication: The emphasis of this thrust area is on the design, fabrication, and testing of individual tunable photodetectors (pixels) that are suitable for integration into large format focal plane arrays.  II. Integrated Focal Plane Arrays: The emphasis in this thrust area is on the complete integration of the high-performance pixels developed in Thrust I into large format focal plane arrays that demonstrate these benefits. Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 02-20 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.  PROGRAM SCOPE  The AFPA program will consist of an 18 month Phase I effort followed by an optional Phase II (18 months) and Phase III (12 months) for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD. Awards totaling approximately $18 million for the first phase are expected to be made during the first half of calendar year 2003. Options totaling approximately $30 million may be awarded for Phase II and Phase III efforts. Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each phase). Multiple awards are anticipated. Collaborative efforts/teaming are strongly encouraged. A web site- https://www.davincinetbook.com/afpa -- has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  The web site provided is consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. The program will also support some very innovative individual investigator efforts. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort. Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, LTC John Carrano, phone: (703) 696-2252, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: jcarrano@darpa.mil.  GENERAL INFORMATION Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled "BAA 02-20, Adaptive Focal Plane Array (AFPA), Proposer Information Pamphlet" which provides further information on areas of interest, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original hardcopy of the proposal, 9 hardcopies and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the proposal (PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable each on a CD-ROM, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette). Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-18, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2. The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 02-20) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Tuesday, July 2, 2002, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 02-20 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only".  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in Adaptive Focal Plane Array.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 02-20.  Proposals may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.  EVALUATION CRITERIA Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals, which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort. The administrative addresses for this BAA are:Fax:  (703) 696-2206 (Addressed to: DARPA/MTO, BAA 02-20), Electronic Mail:  BAA02-20@darpa.mil Mail: DARPA/MTO, ATTN: BAA 02-20 3701 North Fairfax Drive Arlington, VA 22203-1714  This announcement and the Proposer Information Pamphlet may be retrieved via the WWW at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ in the solicitations area.

POC CLAUDINE DALTON (816)823-2271, CONTRACTING OFFICER, PEGGY JEWETT (816)823-2266. REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL NOTICE FOR IDIQ Contract for Construction in the State of Nebraska and the Cities of Sioux City and Council Bluffs in the State of Iowa, Project RNE22125. NOTE: Offerors are required to have an established office within the (SMSA), PRIOR to issuance of the Request for Technical Proposals. (SMSA consists of Pottawattamie County in Iowa, Douglas, Sarpy or Lancaster Counties in Nebraska). Request for Technical Proposals (Phase I) will issue on or about 6/13/2002 with a closing date of on or about 7/17/2002.  

Request for Price Proposals (Phase II) will issue on or about 8/28/2002 with a closing date on or about 10/01/2002. Time for completion approximately 150 calendar days. Anticipated maximum ordering limitation per year: $2,000,000. Guaranteed Annual Minimum: $200.00. Estimated cost range per task order: $2,000.00 - $2,000,000.00. A typical task order could contain some or all of the following: modifications to architectural components including, but not limited to: ceilings, walls, floors (including access floor systems), roofing systems, millwork, and wall covering. Work may also include modifications and replacement of mechanical systems to include, but not be limited to: air handling units, chillers, boilers, ductwork systems and accessories, piping systems (including pumps), HVAC system controls, fire protection sprinkler systems and accessories, and plumbing equipment/accessories. Work may also include electrical systems to include, but not be limited to: lighting systems, primary and secondary power distribution systems and transformers. Special competencies will be required for any work involving membrane roofing, asbestos abatement, PCB removal and/or elevator work. The Government will award up to 10 (ten) IDIQ contracts under this solicitation. Each award will be for one year. There will also be four additional one-year options. The award of a firm-fixed price task order will result from Phase II of this solicitation. It is anticipated that future projects will be awarded on a task order basis to the one contractor (of the awardees) who offers the lowest lump sum price. This is a competitive negotiated acquisition. Proposals will be evaluated using a Two-Phase process. Phase I will be technical evaluations, Phase II will be pricing. The Government intends to use the "greatest value concept" in making the selections. The "greatest value concept" is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors. Phase I, the Request for Technical Proposals (RFTP), contains Construction Contract Clauses, Labor Standards, Solicitation Provisions, Proposal Submittal Requirements and Evaluation Factors. This RFTP will issue on or about 6/13/2002.  All requests for the RFTP must be in writing. There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on or about 07/02/2002. Proposals shall be received in this office on or about 7/17/2002. Specific date and time shall be specified in the RFTP. Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed to Phase II without discussion. However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected to participate in Phase II and may discuss proposals with the offerors. The Government will evaluate Phase I submissions to establish those within a "competitive range". A"short-list" of technically qualified contractors will be published in Fed Biz Opps on or about 8/23/2002. Only those firms within the competitive range will be invited by the Government to provide Phase II submissions, consisting of pricing and any special requirements defined in the specifications. Two factors will be considered: a technical evaluation factor and price. The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are: (1) Construction Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualification of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Special Capabilities. The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factors. As proposals become more equal in technical merit, price becomes more important. Phase II, specifications (bidding documents) will be available from the General Services Administration at no cost. Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Rick Etem, at (816)823-2261. NOTE: OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE AN ESTABLISHED OFFICE WITHIN THE OMAHA or LINCOLN NEBRASKA SMSA (THE SMSA AREA CONSISTS OF POTTAWATTAMIE COUNTY IN IOWA, DOUGLAS, SARPY OR LANCASTER COUNTIES IN NEBRASKA) PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF THE REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.  AN ESTABLISHED OFFICE IS DEFINED AS AN ESTABLISHED BASE OF OPERATIONS FOR TWO OR MORE PERMANENT PERSONNEL FROM WHICH PREVIOUS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED and/or PERFORMED.  REQUESTS FOR SPECIFICATIONS MUST BE FAXED TO CLAUDINE DALTON AT  (816)823-2273. REQUESTS MUST BE ON COMPANY LETTERHEAD WITH COMPANY NAME, ADDRESS, TELEPHONE NUMBER AND FAX NUMBER.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION MUST BE INCLUDED WITH REQUEST IN ORDER FOR REQUEST TO BE HONORED: COPY OF A VALID BUSINESS LICENSE OR OTHER DOCUMENTATION GRANTED BY THE STATE OR LOCAL JURISDICTION TO CONDUCT BUSINESS, COMPANY DUNS NUMBER, AND A VALID IRS TAX ID NUMBER.

Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), states that when the Agency's need for the supplies or services are deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, and is of such that the Government would be seriously injured unless the Agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 5/24/02.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>Optical Radiation Research and Field Services: Laser and Broadband Bioeffects and Personnel Protection, SSS PKR-02-02. Qualified sources are sought for professional scientific and engineering services in primary support of the Optical Radiation Branch, Air Force Research Laboratory?s Human Effectiveness Directorate; as well as provide support to US Army and US Navy biomedical detachments at Brooks AFB TX. Scientific, engineering, and analytical capabilities are sought to understand, mitigate, and exploit effects of optical radiation devices (lasers and broadband) and their countermeasures on personnel. Technical efforts will focus on six major areas: safety standards for optical sources; personnel susceptibility to optical sources; personnel protection against optical systems; high energy laser (HEL) safety analysis; optical radiation bioeffects; and optical radiation safety. Research will require experiments using human and non-human subjects, studies that correlate optical exposure with visual function and performance, threshold studies for eye and skin injuries, development of diagnostic and triage technologies and medical treatment modalities, development of methods to assess probability of exposure to optical radiation, and field hazard analysis of military and commercial systems. Efforts will require development and testing of protection technologies, low-vision models and simulations, medical accident registry and safety databases, operational engagement models, and special test equipment that measures physical, psychophysical, and environmental properties of optical protection. On-site government facilities equipment at Brooks AFB TX will be used, although performance of some work off-site is permissible and may be required. Potential offerors must be able to demonstrate capability in the areas of psychophysics, optical engineering, systems analysis, ophthalmology, optometry, mathematics, statistics, risk assessment visualization and simulation, laser physics, test and measurement, non-linear optics, or theoretical physics. A thorough knowledge of laser safety and biomedical literature, personnel protection technologies, visual performance in military environments, and radiometry across the optical waveband is essential, as well as capabilities and experience in software engineering that would be at least the equivalent of CMM Level II certification criteria. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) 60 month, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is contemplated for this effort. Any contract awarded from this requirement will require the contractor to have a ?Cleared Facility.? Contractor personnel will be required to have a Secret security clearance, with some personnel cleared to the Top Secret level. Teaming is highly encouraged, as well as the use of technical consultants in academia and industry.

<DESC>The purpose of this notification is to amend synopsis/ solicitation number N00173-02-R-RS03 for a Pedestal Tracking Mount, previously posted in the FBO on 29 April 2002. This amendment is numbered 0002. The purpose of this amendment is to respond to technical and business questions posed against the original synopsis/solicitation.  
Question 1: Is it the Government's intent to operate the system in a slaved mode of operation?
Answer 1: The system will be a custom-built IR camera and tracker electronics system.  It will be similar to the visible camera and tracker called for in the option.  It is anticipated that the custom electronics will need the same interface that would be provided by the option tracker.
Question 2: The 6 degree FOV with a typical CCD camera yields an IFOV of 139 uradians.  This is not consistent with a < 50 uradian tracking capability, assuming a 1 pixel AVT tracking accuracy.  In order to meet the required tracking accuracy either a megapixel camera or a longer focal length lens with a smaller FOV would have to be used.  Please comment on this.
Answer 2: The specification for the pedestal is the driving factor for this acquisition.  The pedestal, with or without tracker, shall be capable of the 50 microrads requirement.  Offerors should provide a cost effective FOV which is consistent with the specification.

No other changes are made in the synopsis/solicitation.

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to solicit proposals for a five-year, Performance Based Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC or IDIQ), utilizing either Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) or Cost-Reimbursement (cost-plus-fixed-fee) (CPFF), Cost Reimbursement-no fee, pricing/payment methods for task orders to be issued. We anticipate that the solicitation will be released on or about January 24, 2002. This RFP incorporates the services previously synopsized under M/OP-01-994 for Womens Legal Rights. USAID will be making multiple awards (up to six) for technical assistance and advisory services to support mission in the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Women in Development to help ensure that women participate fully and benefit equally from U.S. development assistance programs. [The RFP will result in the award of up to six (6) Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs); up to three under full and open competition, two under a partial set-aside for small business concerns, and one under a set-aside for small disadvantaged business (8[a]) concerns]. Today the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Women in Development office assists the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) with integration of gender concerns into all USAID programs, coordinates with the donor community, and identifies emerging issues where gender is a key concern. The office has four strategic objectives: Enhancing the economic status of women; Expanding educational opportunities for girls and women; Improving women's legal rights and increasing their participation in civil society; and Integrating gender considerations throughout USAID programs. In pursuing these objectives, the WID Office supports technical assistance and training for USAID Missions, host countries and non-governmental organizations (NOGs); promotes greater awareness of gender issues through publications and conferences; and funds studies of emerging issues. The purpose of this contract is to acquire quick-response short- and long-term technical services, including reports and other deliverables, for the implementation of EGAT/WIDs strategy, which includes support to other USAID operating units in integrating gender considerations into their programs and activities. The quick-response short- and long-term technical services into five major areas:(1)Technical Assistance and Training;(2)Legal;(3)Communications and Outreach (including conference planning and implementation);(4) Grants; and(5)Research. USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of U.S. small businesses, U.S. small disadvantaged businesses, U.S. women-owned small businesses, and U.S. HUBZone small businesses in this activity as prime or subcontractors in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR. In this respect, it is anticipated that the prime contractor will make every reasonable effort to identify and make maximum practicable use of such concerns. To help identify potential subcontractors, a list of all organizations requesting a copy of the solicitation will be included with each solicitation issued. By providing the list, USAID does not endorse the listed organizations as being capable of carrying out the activity, nor does USAID verify the claimed status of the organizations. Necessarily, the list will contain the names of only those organizations known prior to the issuance of the solicitation. Telephone requests for the RFP will not be honored.

<DESC>The U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID) in Kampala, Uganda has issued RFP 617-02-009 for the design and implementation of the Agricultural Productivity Enhancement Program (APEP) through a cost reimbursement contract for a period of five years, including the initial design phase. The primary objective of APEP will be to expand economic opportunities in the Ugandan agricultural sector by increasing agricultural productivity and marketing of key food and cash crop systems.  While building on past successes, the new program will place greater emphasis on creating economies of scale that will catalyze the transformation of Ugandan agriculture from low input/low output, subsistence farming to commercially competitive agriculture. The program will identify and address priority food and cash crop systems where productivity gains will lead to significant impacts on the economy and significant numbers of the rural population. APEP will address key constraints in the chain of production-to-market transactions, including input supply and distribution, applied research, technology applications, value-added processing, access to finance, producer organizations, and market development.  Emphasis also will be given to creating competitive agricultural and other off-farm rural enterprises as part of the transformation process. To request a copy of the solicitation please send an E-mail request to: snagwere@usaid.gov, or request a copy by mail by faxing your request to the Contracting Officer at 256 41 258981/233417.

The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet. (By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5 floppy disk (Microsoft 97 format), via e-mail, or in hard copy). You must confirm in writing to the contact person noted below that, you have received the solicitation (when posted) through the Internet.

However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet. You are therefore advised to regularly check the FBO Internet site for amendments. NAICS: 541611, Competition Level: Full and Open, Order of Magnitude (Threshold): Estimated $22 million.

Lightweight technologies for providing 7.62 mm bullet resistance are preferred.  Capabilities for testing ballistic protection are also sought.

As prescribed in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information (RFI) nor to otherwise pay for the information provided.  This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry.  Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released.  There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.  The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  If there is a GSA or other contract vehicle already available for the technology being proposed, please include this information in the response.  Firms who wish to respond to this request for information should contact Ms Phyllis J.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis and the following information is provided to conduct a Market Research of Industry to identify vendors with products that may suit our needs.  The purpose is to identify potential vendors only.  This is not a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid and funds are currently not available for development or acquisition.  The T-38 System Program Director located at Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill AFB, Utah, has an interest in replacing the Fuel Flow Transmitter (FFT) currently installed on the J&#64979;85 jet engine used on USAF T-38 aircraft with a newer, more-reliable unit.  If the decision is made to purchase a replacement FFT, approximately 1,000 FFTs will be required.  Both large and small businesses are encouraged to respond, however respondees to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations.  The following information may help you determine if you have a product that meets our requirements:

1.	The current Fuel Flow Transmitter (NSN 6620-00-555-3991, P/N TRU6A) is an engine-mounted motor-driven device that sends an analog signal to the fuel flow indicators in both cockpits of the T-38 aircraft.  It has an unacceptable failure rate and replacing it requires removing the engine.  A form/fit/function replacement with a much higher MTBF (minimum MTBF to be determined) would be of interest.

2.	The T-38 fleet is currently being modified with a glass cockpit which includes an electronic engine display (EED). The EED was designed to accept analog inputs from the current FFT.  If required, the EED would be modified to interface with a modern, digital FFT.  Effect of electromagnetic interference on the digital FFT is a consideration due to proximity of electromechanical components.  The digital FFT will be considered for use in both, modified and unmodified aircraft.  A highly reliable digital FFT would be of interest.

3.	The current FFT is mounted on the engine, therefore, only fuel flow to the main engine section is measured.  We are tentatively exploring the idea of moving the FFT off the engine and rerouting fuel lines so that total engine fuel flow is measured.  This would also make the FFT more accessible during removal and replacement.  Engineering consideration must be given to any restriction (i.e. pressure loss) caused by installing the FFT in a location that measures total fuel flow.  We are interested in any market expertise that addresses the impact of the pressure drop across the FFT, should we measure total fuel flow.  In addition, we are also interested in locating the FFT in a location off the engine that does not necessarily measure total fuel flow but allows removal and replacement without removing the engines.

If your company has a suitable product, that meets the criteria for one, or more of the items listed, you are invited to submit a capability summary.  Please note that the government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey. Responses are due within 30 days of this announcement.  Electronic replies are encouraged, but you may also mail your response.  Send to Ms. Mary Adams, Contracting Officer, at mary.adams@hill.af.mil , OO-ALC/LCK, 6038 Aspen Ave, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5805.

<DESC>The IRS is in the process of analyzing the capabilities within the market place to provide training space administrative services in IRS Campus Centers at 10 sites located in Andover, MA, Chamblee, GA, Holtsville, NY, Covington, KY, Philadelphia, PA, Memphis, TN, Fresno, CA, Overland Park, KS/Kansas City, MO, Ogden, UT, and Austin, TX.  This function currently comprises 194 training rooms, ranging in size from auditorium to breakout rooms.  Some of the training rooms are equipped with computers. Approximately 10,000 annual training events are scheduled in the rooms. Events range from hour-long training sessions to sessions spanning several months.  Since the facilities are open 24 hours a day, business managers at the campus may askto schedule a training session, and will expect administrative training staff support, at any hour.  Customers of the training centers are all employees of the agency, which comprises approximately 63,600 customers.  The IRS is interested in those contractors that have experience in supporting training centers who are able to perform all of the following functions: 1.  Scheduling classroom space to maximize usage; including resolving conflicts.  This is especially important, since many training events are time-sensitive and cannot be easily rescheduled to periods of low training activity.  2.  Ordering and providing supplies for instructors and students, receiving course materials (internal textbooks, commercial texts, and government forms) and notifying customer contact points of classroom locations. 3.  Set-up and maintenance of classrooms and equipment, including AV equipment and computer hardware.  4.  Providing instructor orientation to the facility, its equipment, and its services.  5.  Photocopying class materials for the instructors.   Since access to the facilities is restricted to government employees, access to the facility requires Federal government background checks.  Background checks are submitted to a federal background investigation center and are not paid for by the Government.  The agency will provide the facility including training furniture and equipment from its current facilities (e.g., tables, chairs, podiums, overhead projectors, VCRs and computer hardware, etc.). Through this RFI, IRS seeks interested, experienced parties to furnish capabilities statements with information provided in the responses to this RFI to assess the interest and desire of either contractor or Government organizations in providing these types of administrative training services in a Campus Center environment.  Based on that assessment, IRS will decide whether to issue a solicitation for the services.  This RFI is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Responses to this RFI will not be considered as proposals or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Address responses to Arthur Dalton (202) 283-1172, IRS - A:P:P:P, 6009 Oxon Hill Road, Oxon Hill, MD 20745.  Fax responses are acceptable; fax: (202) 283-1529.  E:mail responses are also acceptable; Arthur.L.Dalton@irs.gov.  All final written responses to this RFI should be received by 5/28/02, 16:00 local time.

<DESC>The IRS is in the process of analyzing the capabilities within the market place to provide training space administrative services from government location(s) or from contractor-owned locations to support 23 IRS field sites located in Atlanta, GA, Baltimore, MD, Cheektowaga, NY, Chicago, IL, Cincinnati, OH, Cleveland, OH, Dallas, TX, Denver, CO, Detroit, MI, Indianapolis, IN, Jacksonville, FL, Nashville, TN, New Carrollton, MD, New York/Brooklyn, NY, Pittsburgh, PA, Portland, OR, Richmond, 
VA, Seattle, WA, Oakland, CA, Los Angeles, CA, Laguna Niguel, CA, St. Louis, MO, and Puerto Rico.  This function currently comprises 275 training rooms, ranging in size from auditorium to breakout rooms.  Some of the training rooms are equipped with computers.  Approximately 6,500 annual training events are scheduled in the rooms.  Training is conducted during normal business hours, but may be scheduled outside those hours for unique circumstances.  Events range from hour-long training sessions to sessions spanning several months.  Customers of the training centers are all employees of the agency, and comprise approximately 62,000 customers.  The IRS is interested in those contractors that have experience in supporting training centers who are able to perform all of the following functions: 1.  Scheduling classroom space to maximize usage; including resolving conflicts.  This is especially important, since many training events are time-sensitive and cannot be easily rescheduled to period of low training activity. 2. Ordering and providing supplies for instructors and students, receiving course materials (internal textbooks, commercial texts, and government forms) and notifying customer contact points of classroom locations.  3.  Set-up and maintenance of classrooms and equipment, including AV equipment and computer hardware.  4.  Providing instructor orientation to the facility, its equipment, and its services.  5.  Photocopying class materials for the instructors.  Since access to the facilities is restricted to government employees, access to the facility requires Federal background checks.  Background checks are submitted to a federal background investigation center and are not paid for by the Government.  The agency may be able to furnish the contractor with some training furniture and equipment from its current facilities (e.g., tables, chairs, podiums, overhead projectors, VCRs and computer hardware, etc.).  Through this RFI, IRS seeks interested experienced parties to furnish capabilities statements with information illustrating experience in these services.  IRS will use the information provided in the responses to this RFI to assess the relevent experience and availability of contractor employees and/or facilities as well as commercially available contractor owned training facilities.  This RFI is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Advanced Information Technology Systems Joint Program Office (AITS JPO), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) are jointly issuing this Request for Information to industry, seeking information on available technologies applicable to transportation processes.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY!!  It is neither a Request for Proposal (RFP)/solicitation, nor an indication that DISA, DARPA, or USTRANSCOM will contract for the items and services described in this RFI.  There is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  The Government does not intend to award a contract solely on the basis of the RFI.  The Government will NOT pay for information received in response to this RFI.  Submitted documents will NOT be returned to those firms who provide responses to this RFI.  The objective of this RFI is to obtain market research in order to assist in the development of preliminary acquisition planning.  No award will be made on the basis of any responses to this RFI.  All interested parties may respond in writing with information on their product and services with sufficient technical and cost information to allow for a detailed evaluation to the Technical Point of Contact, Gary Buchanan, PH: (703) 882-1447, email: buchanag@ncr.disa.mil.  The NAICS code is 541512.  

The purpose of the RFI is to perform market research in obtaining information technology capabilities via contractor written capability summaries.   Upon review of capability summaries submitted, the government may request those firms, whose capabilities are deemed most applicable to transportation scheduling technology to provide a demonstration of their capabilities.  Due to the anticipated high volume of responses, the Government reserves the right to invite selected contractors to provide a demonstration.  The Government is under no obligation to allow all contractors an opportunity for a demonstration.  For those companies invited, it is the Government's intent to limit the time for each demonstration to approximately forty (40) minutes for the actual demonstration and another twenty (20) for a question and answer session.  Demonstrations will be conducted at or near the United States Transportation Command Headquarters at Scott AFB in Belleville, IL.

The following are those main areas in which the government is most interested in obtaining information:  a) Suite of COTS capabilities in open, scalable architectures with distributed, re-configurable structures and the capability to be managed across multiple security levels in a Supply Chain Management, Transportation context; b) COTS Scheduling tools capable of optimizing transportation assets across all echelons of Defense Transportation System from strategic to operational to tactical levels - from USTRANSCOM down to the operator in the field; c) COTS Transportation mode determination and optimization software to make best use of transportation assets from a lift provider /carrier's perspective; d) COTS Systems capable of interfacing with existing and migrating military transportation systems; and e) Other approaches that commercial industry has successfully applied against similar Supply Chain Management (SCM) challenges.

Responses should clearly state what the technology has to offer, highlight its applicability to USTRANSCOM processes, and briefly mention the maturity of the technology.  The response should also provide a brief description of the demonstration itself and any equipment required by the Government to host the demonstration.

Responses shall be submitted to the DISA Technical Point of Contact no later than 4 PM EDT, ten (10) calendar days after the date of publication of this notice, in order to be considered in the demonstration schedule. Responses received after that date may be evaluated at the Government's discretion as time permits.  Questions may be directed to the Program Manager, CDR Curt Hammill by phone at 703-882-1445 or by e-mail at HammillW@ncr.disa.mil or the Technical Point of Contact, Gary Buchanan, PH: (703) 882-1447, email: buchanag@ncr.disa.mil.  Responses shall be submitted on pages 8.5 x 11 inches in size, single or double spaced, margins not less than one inch all around, one-sided printing, pages numbered, in at least 10 point type.  The response is limited to five (5) pages maximum.  Preferred method of response is email and should be limited to 2MB (in Word 8.0 or later for IBM-compatible).  Additionally, an electronic copy (disk) of the capabilities summary should be mailed to:

Attn: USTC-Demo-RFI
c/o Gary Buchanan
5275 Leesburg Pike
Skyline 7 (Room 3N18-4C)
Falls Church, VA 22041

If a vendor has a number of unique technologies that are applicable to the above areas, the vendor may, at its discretion, submit multiple responses for each specific technology.  No more than three (3) submissions will be accepted per vendor.  Please note, not all vendors providing written capabilities summaries will be invited to provide demonstrations.  The Government will not offer any compensation, monetary or otherwise, for either the written submission or the demonstration, should one be given.  The contractor assumes all liability of all costs, to include, but not be limited to, preparation, mailing, travel, and special equipment.

<DESC>The purpose of this special notice is for the U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to provide information to assist in planning and to locate additional sources of supply by providing advance estimates of future requirements for private secure detention services.   While the estimates are based on the best information available, the information is subject to modification and is in no way binding on the Government.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP).    The INS will issue a formal announcement with specific terms and conditions prior to the release of any RFP for services described in this notice.  The INS has identified a potential requirement for a contractor-owned/contractor-operated secure detention facility to house approximately 1200 adult criminal and non-criminal aliens detained in INS custody.  The following requirements are anticipated: (1) A population consisting of a variety of security requirements, nationalities, languages, and both males (approximately 90%) and females (approximately 10%); (2) Secure housing for low risk (approximately 40% dormitory); medium risk (approximately 45% double cell); high risk/segregation (approximately 5% single cell) male detainees and low risk (approximately 8% dormitory); medium risk (approximately 2% double cell) female detainees; (3) Facility capability to segregate the INS detainee population from other populations housed; (4) Adequate office, court, and attorney space components necessary to facilitate the INS mission; (5) A minimum facility capacity of 900 detainees; (6) A geographic location within 120 miles of 1600 Callowhill Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19130;  (7) Facility location with proximate access to emergency services (medical, fire, law enforcement, etc.);  (8) Facilities may be new construction, expansion, or existing and be either private or local/state government owned/operated; (9) The contractor would be required to provide all necessary facilities, personnel, services, equipment, and supplies needed for contract performance and be ready to accept INS detainees within 365 days of contract award; (10) Performance compliant with INS/DOJ Detention Standards and the current American Correctional Association Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities.  It is anticipated the RFP would: (1) Require offerors to clearly demonstrate they have corporate/organizational experience operating secure corrections/detention facilities for a continuous three-year period as of the date the RFP is issued; (2) Establish length of contract term as a negotiable item; (3) Permit offerors to propose more than one facility/site for consideration; (4) Have the  potential for multiple contract awards;  (5) Establish past performance and experience as significant factors in the evaluation of offers; (6) Establish a best value trade-off source selection procedure as the basis for award; (7) Result in award of a firm-fixed price, indefinite-delivery/ indefinite-quantity, contract with performance incentives.  It is anticipated that offerors shall be required to provide information to the INS for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 432`, et seq., and the implementing regulations at 40 CFR Part 1500.  It is anticipated that, NO LATER THAN 60 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF A FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT for a specific requirement, offerors will be required to submit a Phase I Survey (three copies) conducted in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM, E-1527-97, "Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessment: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process" for each proposed site.  The Phase 1 Survey would include, as a "non-Scope Consideration" under Chapter 12 of the Standard Practice, a delineation or identification of on-site wetlands and an analysis of potential impacts to threatened or endangered species or species of special status.  The identification of on-site wetlands should include an on-site reconnaissance level survey/report by a qualified wetlands specialist, the National Wetlands Inventory map for the project area, and an identification of hydric soils on the proposed property.  The analysis of potential impacts to the threatened and endangered species and species of special status should include a site reconnaissance report identifying potential habitat or presence of protected species by a qualified biologist with federal and state threatened and endangered species (plant and animal) lists.  It is anticipated that a failure to submit the Phase I Survey for any site within 60 days from the date of a formal announcement for a specific requirement shall preclude that site from being considered for the procurement.  It is anticipated the Government shall only accept offers for which a Phase I Survey has been timely submitted and that all other offers will be rejected.  Potential offerors are advised that any, and all, information submitted as part of the Phase I Survey shall be considered non-proprietary and, at the discretion of the Government, may be made public during the scoping process under NEPA or at any other appropriate time.  Upon formal announcement of a specific requirement, prospective offerors will be required to submit, in writing to the Contracting Officer, all requests for Wage Determinations for the geographic area in which they are proposing to perform the identified service.  It is anticipated this potential requirement may result in the issuance of an RFP during the Fall of 2002.  Interested parties should consider the information contained in this special notice and assess their potential to provide the anticipated requirements.  Interested parties requiring further information should submit their request in writing to the Mr. Peter M. Dietrich, Contracting Officer, 70 Kimball Avenue, South  Burlington, VT 05403, or by e-mail at Peter.M.Dietrich@USDOJ.gov  No collect calls will be accepted.  No telephone calls for solicitations will be accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) is seeking sources of COMMERCIALLY available hardware technologies suitable for In-Transit Visibility (ITV) aboard ships. We envision Naval transportation nodes (ARG and MPF ships) will be instrumented with this hardware technology to allow the capture of ITV data at entry/exit points (Well Decks, Vehicle ramps, underway replenishment stations).  Sustainment items (rolling stock, 20-ft shipping containers, Quadroons, palletized loads) will have RFID tags/sensors affixed.  The readers will be used to identify the sensors (e.g. the items) and transmit the identification data to a central storage device such as a computer server.  We conducted an initial assessment of the technical challenges involved in this effort and identified a number of issues or factors that potentially may influence/impact the selection of a particular hardware technology. These issues include: (1) Physical/Environmental: Exposure to moisture, weather, saltwater, wear on the equipment, etc. and the need to perform a ship alteration if the hardware technology was permanently installed on-board ship; (2) Radio Frequency Issues: On-board and host nation frequency approval issues that may preclude a system from being employed; (3) Wireless Security: Encryption, Authentication etc. Need to be aware of security requirements for passing data wirelessly from Tag to Interrogator to Server.  (RF Issues should include wireless security); (4) Life Cycle Support: Battery life, high reliability, availability, maintainability and durability, etc; (5) Safety: Portability vs. non-portability, tying into the ship?s electrical system, RF interference issues, etc. Respondents should provide the following information:  Name and address of Company, Company Point-of-Contact, Company phone and fax number (email address if available), Brochures and/or pamphlets, and technical data/qualification information of your hardware technology specifically addressing the above mentioned challenges. Responses should pertain only to Equipment Product Information sought, do not include software/software development information. Submit all responses to Pearl Wray at e-mail address: wrayp@cbchue.navfac.navy.mil.  It is requested that all proprietary information that is not to be disseminated in government documents be clearly identified.  NOTE:  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR SOLICITATION AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THE RESPONSES HERETO, OR ON FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION SUBSEQUENTLY SOUGHT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION WILL BE MADE.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ULTIMATELY ISSUE AN IFB, RFP, RFQ, OR CONTRACT. Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation or response letters will be issued to the participants.  DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF RESPONSES IS 07 JUNE 2002.

[The RFP will result in the award of up to six (6) Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs); up to three under full and open competition, two under a partial set-aside for small business concerns, and one under a set-aside for small disadvantaged business (8[a]) concerns]. Today the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Women in Development office assists the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) with integration of gender concerns into all USAID programs, coordinates with the donor community, and identifies emerging issues where gender is a key concern. The office has four strategic objectives: Enhancing the economic status of women; Expanding educational opportunities for girls and women; Improving women's legal rights and increasing their participation in civil society; and Integrating gender considerations throughout USAID programs. In pursuing these objectives, the WID Office supports technical assistance and training for USAID Missions, host countries and non-governmental organizations (NOGs); promotes greater awareness of gender issues through publications and conferences; and funds studies of emerging issues. The purpose of this contract is to acquire quick-response short- and long-term technical services, including reports and other deliverables, for the implementation of EGAT/WIDs strategy, which includes support to other USAID operating units in integrating gender considerations into their programs and activities.

<SUBJECT>A -- Special Notice
<DESC>NIST DOCKET NUMBER: 01-029PA2 Title: Simplified Methods for Electrokinetic Focusing of Samples in Microfluidic Devices Description: Methods are described for the focusing of ionic species in microfluidic systems using electric field gradients that are generated without external electrical connections. In the first example, the electric field within a microchannel is effected by putting a highly or partially conductive material
 inside portions of the channel. The conductive material can consist, for example, of a metal film on the channel walls. The presence of conductive material will alter the total conductivity of the microchannel, and thereby alter the electric field in the microchannel.
     Regions of different electric field can be created by applying different films (or no films)to different regions of the microchannel. The electric field gradients at the borders
between these different regions can then be used to focus and concentrate ionic species by balancing their electrophoretic velocities with an applied bulk fluid velocity. In the second example, the electric field gradient which is used for electrokinetic focusing is created by application of a temperature gradient. In order for this to work, the conductivity of the buffer within the microchannels must depend on temperature in a
way that differs from the typical inverse proportionality with the buffer viscosity. For example, it must have an ionic strength that is temperature dependent. Also discussed is a related method which can be used to produce streams of either concentrated or diluted
analytes. For further information, call Mary Clague (301)975-4188.

This TACOM sponsored symposium was planned with administrative sup port from the Michigan Chapter National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA). This event brought together over 480 government and industry representatives to discuss issues and concerns relevant to the constant changes in the logistics environment. This was the first time the symposium morning and selected afternoon presentations were telecast live to all five TACOM sites (TACOM-Warren, Rock Island, ARDEC, and Red River and Anniston Army depots). The briefings were also telecast live to the Soldier, Biological, and Chemical Command (SBCCOM), the Communications Electronic Command (CECOM), and Fort Drum. It is estimated that over 300 government personnel viewed the proceedings by live telecast. The briefings, exhibits, and break-out sessions reflected many aspects of the transformation within the Department of Defense and the Army. The Army is transforming to a force that is tactically and strategically responsive, interconnected, has a reduced l ogistics trail, and is lethal across the spectrum of conflict.  The presentations focused on the following: The Army transformation and AMC's role, logistics innovation, maintenance transformation, robotics, nano-technologies, future strategic issues/future warfare, unconventional warfare, the Army/DARPA technology pro gram, Abrams recaptilization sustainment initiatives, and science and technology.  The briefings also covered transformation strategies, enablers for the objective force, revised acquisition strategies, modeling and simulation, and battlefield logistics. Representatives from the government and industry described the logistical and techni cal support required to meet the Department of Defense mission.  The symposium received positive feedback from the attendees and those viewing the proceedings by live telecast.

<SUBJECT>60 -- FPI Production in FSC Code 6020 and FSC Code 6135
<DESC>This notice announces decisions by the Board of Directors for Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) on two issues.  The first issue deals with FPI's production in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 6135 - Non-rechargeable Batteries.  The second issue is in regard to FPI's production in FSC code 6020 - Fiber Optic Cable Assemblies and Harnesses.

FPI's new product/significant expansion guidelines were published March 12, 1997 in the Federal Register.  A provision of the guidelines allows for FPI to exceed a specific product's expansion threshold in cases of public exigency, such as a national defense emergency.  The guidelines require that FPI receive a specific order or request from Department of Defense (DoD) or Executive Branch officials for this provision to be invoked.  Upon invoking this provision, the guidelines allow that 'increased sales resulting from national exigencies will not be considered a violation of the guidelines ceiling in the year in which they occur.'

During March, 2002, FPI received an official request from the Department of the Army's Communications-Electronics Command for FPI to fulfill DoD's needs for two types of batteries in FSC code 6135.  FPI's FY 2002 sales ceiling for FSC code 6135 is $6.4 million.  Based on year-to-date sales, the additional work represented by the DoD request would cause FPI to exceed this sales ceiling.

The DoD request stated that FPI is the only known, qualified contractor of both batteries.  The DoD request also stated 'continued production and delivery of these batteries is necessary to support critical survival radio and distress strobe light requirements of all military services.'  On March 28, 2002, FPI presented its Board of Directors with a request to invoke the guidelines' 'national exigency' provision.  In light of the military's critical need for these items, FPI staff requested its Board approve FPI's production at the levels requested by the customer, which would result in FPI's sales in FSC 6135 reaching approximately $9.6 million.

FPI's Board of Directors officially approved this request.  The Board's approval means that FPI's sales in FSC code 6135 may temporarily exceed the guidelines ceiling without it constituting a guidelines violation.

Also in March, 2002, FPI staff informed its Board of Directors of, and requested approval for, FPI's sales in FSC code 6020, which have exceeded the FY 2002 sales ceilings.  During FY 2001, FPI waived an order from DoD for two types of fiber optic cables in FSC code 6020.  Upon being notified that FPI had waived the order for these items, DoD attempted to contract with a private vendor to fill the order.  However, to date, the private vendor has yet to pass all first article test requirements.

In light of this, DoD requested FPI to re-bid on this product.  FPI submitted a re-bid, and DoD issued a contract to FPI for both items in August, 2001.  With no other qualified source for these items, DoD recently exercised its option to purchase the maximum number of units allowable under the contract from FPI.  In addition, in November 2001, DoD placed a separate delivery order for these items.  The total value of fiber optic cables in FSC code 6020 ordered by DoD from FPI is $4.9 million.  FPI's sales ceiling for FSC code 6020 in FY 2002 is $1.3 million.   FPI's sales in this category constitute a significant expansion as defined by FPI's guidelines.

FPI staff informed the Board of several mitigating factors that FPI believe warrant the Board's approval of FPI's increased sales levels in FSC code 6020.  These factors include:

*  In correspondence to FPI, DoD officials have stated 'Continued production of these two cables is critical as they provide the communications backbone' for several systems used by the Army.  Therefore, FPI believes these items would qualify under the guidelines' national exigency provision;

*  FPI waived DoD's initial order for these items in January 2000.  From that point forward, the work was available to any interested private vendor;

*  FPI only submitted a re-bid for the order upon a request to do so by DoD;

*  DoD has stated that FPI is the only known, qualified source for these items; and

*  DoD will be able to lessen its reliance upon FPI once a qualified second source for these items is approved.

For these reasons, FPI staff requested the Board authorize a revised sales ceiling covering FSC code 6020 during FY 2002 not to exceed $6 million.  The Board gave its interim approval for this request, subject to comments by interested parties.  Interested parties are invited to submit comments on the Board's interim's decision regarding FPI's sales in FSC code 6020.  The deadline for submitting such comments is 45 days from the submission date of this notice.

It should be noted that the national emergency provision of FPI's guidelines is temporary.  It does not authorize FPI to utilize the higher sales level as a future production baseline.  FPI is not certain how long the current exigency will last due to the ongoing war on terrorism.  While the requested production levels are deemed to be on a temporary basis, at this time, DoD does not know how long the requirement for additional production in these two Federal Supply areas will last. 

Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI's Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to:  Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, DC  20534. Attention:  FPI Board of Directors.
