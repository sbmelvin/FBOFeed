<DESC>KC-10A Background<br /><br />The KC-10 Extender is an Air Mobility Command advanced tanker and cargo aircraft designed to provide increased mobility for U.S. Armed Forces. The primary mission is aerial refueling, but the KC-10 can dually support the war fighter as a cargo aircraft and aeromedical evacuations. The KC-10 entered service in 1981 as a modified Boeing DC-10.
<p>KC-10A Interactive Media Instruction(IMI) Background</p>
<p>The need to take maintenance training off of the flight line results in the need for Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI) and a variety of stand-alone hardware maintenance training devices to fulfill the need -of a Maintenance Training System (MTS). IMI is a predominately interactive, electronic-delivered training which will assist the instructor throughout the familiarization courses of the maintenance systems on the aircraft. An IMI system will include instructional software which will greatly reduce the amount of time required for hands-on training in the MTS devices and real aircraft while providing a safe and realistic training of procedures, systems and situations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to distribute&nbsp;the attached DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) to Training Systems Acquisition (TSA) II Contractors for the KC-10A IMI and to solicit comments and questions from TSA II Contractors.<br /><br />The government's points of contact are Matt Forsythe, (937) 904-7499, matthew.forsythe@wpafb.af.mil, Kendra Herzberger, (937) 656-6996, <a href="mailto:kendra.herzberger@wpafb.af.mil">kendra.herzberger@wpafb.af.mil</a>, Phillip Falter, (937) 255-5357, <a href="mailto:phillip.falter@wpafb.af.mil">phillip.falter@wpafb.af.mil</a>.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information<br><br>Description<br><br>The AN/TSQ-221 Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS), also known as a "Full" TAIS, is a mobile, airspace management system providing combined air-ground operational environment management based on joint service and information system inputs. It is the Army's system of record for the integration and synchronization of Airspace Command and Control (AC2) and Air Traffic Services (ATS) within the Army Battle Command System (ABCS) System of Systems (SoS). A digitized Battlefield Automated System (BAS), TAIS provides situational awareness of friendly and enemy air activity and is interoperable with joint, coalition, and civil aviation forces. It is currently employed by the United States Army in every theater of operation. <br>TAIS provides automated AC2 planning, enhanced AC2 execution, and improved enroute Air Traffic Services support across the range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict to synchronize and integrate operations in the third dimension of the battlefield. TAIS also provides civil and government inter-agency capabilities and a direct link to the Theater Air Ground System (TAGS) through interface with the Joint Force Air Component Commander's (JFACC) automated airspace planning and communication systems. <br><br>TAIS is directly responsive to command-level operations organizations (S-3/G-3). The "Full" TAIS system is co-located with the command and control element at the main command post for Army corps and divisions, and with Army air traffic services units organic to aviation units from brigade to theater levels. The system coordinates use of the battlefield airspace for the purpose of supporting force operations in a force projection role, while minimizing fratricide through improved operational environment synchronization including non-automated airspace users and aircraft. <br><br>TAIS Variants <br><br>The Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS) comes in two variants: single-user portable workstations and the shelter-mounted vehicle ("Full" TAIS) with full capabilities. The AN/FSQ-211, or TAIS Airspace Work Station (AWS), is a portable computer system that hosts the TAIS mission software. The AWS provides a single operator position and relies on external support for air track information and communications connectivity. TAIS AWS are located at every level in the Army from Brigade Combat Team and supporting brigades to theater echelons. <br><br>The AN/TSQ-221, or "Full" TAIS, is a slightly modified Standard Army Shelter (SAS) mounted on an Expanded Capacity Vehicle (ECV) - High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). The system consists of one TAIS shelter vehicle towing a trailer-mounted tactical generator, and one cargo HMMWV for transporting TAIS personnel and equipment such as camouflage and ground support equipment. TAIS is designed to be roll-on, roll-off capable. It can be airlifted by medium-lift helicopters and is transportable by C130 aircraft. The heart of the TAIS system is the mission computers containing unique, powerful TAIS software optimized for the AC2 and ATS missions.<br><br>The Product Manager, Air Traffic Control Systems (PdM ATC) seeks information, comments and suggestions from vendors who intend to perform in a prime contractor role.<br><br>This notice is not a request for proposals.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY FOR THALES ATM, INC. DISTANCE MEASURING EQUIPMENT (DME) TRAINING
1.  BackgroundThe FAA is charged with maintaining the safest, most efficient airspace system in the world. The National Airspace System (NAS) consists of a complex collection of systems, procedures, facilities, aircraft, and people. The NAS and the technologies it uses are constantly evolving. With increasing demand for flights in limited airspace, the FAA is constantly working to balance demand and capacity by minimizing delays and congestion while maximizing volume. The Air Traffic Organization represents the Terminal, En Route, System Operations, and Technical Operations workforces that ensure safety and efficiency within the NAS. The Technical Operations workforce includes those charged with installation, testing, troubleshooting, repair, monitoring, and certification of systems and equipment used to maintain the NAS.  As Technical Operations hires new employees to ensure its facilities are safely staffed for the air traffic of tomorrow, the Office of Technical Operations Training Administration serves as a bridge to the future by providing technical training programs that meet requirements set by the operational service units.
2.  Introduction/PurposeThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) needs to maintain its resource base of technicians educated to maintain and repair existing Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) provided by Thales ATM, Inc. 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has DME equipment, purchased by Thales ATM, Inc., in multiple sites throughout the United States.  Technicians trained to repair and maintain this equipment are critical to preserve a healthy building environment sufficient for housing personnel.  The goal is to train FAA technicians on the Thales ATM, Inc. DME equipment; to provide an introduction to the equipment by explaining the composition, function and components; and to provide instruction on equipment processes, repair and maintenance.
A.  FAA48094 DME Butler/Wilcox Course: This course provides training for technicians on the Butler 1020 and Wilcox model 596B/C Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) ground station.  Subjects include block diagrams; signal flow and schematic diagrams of the transponder, monitor, control unit, and test unit; alignment and test procedures for transponder and monitor; operation testing; hands-on troubleshooting; and fault finding on the DME.
B.  FAA48101 DME 5960 Factory Course:This course provides training for technicians on the Wilcox 5960 Distance Measuring Equipment (DME).  Lectures cover the Wilcox 5960 DME.  Laboratory sessions include fault diagnosis, performance analysis, test procedures, use of test equipment, and routing checks and adjustments.
The courses referenced above are required by FAA Technicians to support fielded equipment. Student's participation in this course should learn the theory of operations through maintenance and, troubleshooting of equipment to the depth necessary to identify and isolate malfunction, identify system malfunctions in an operation system and perform those adjustments necessary to restore the system to operation with prescribed standards and tolerances to perform periodic maintenance activities specified.	
To date, Thales ATM, Inc. has provided all FAA training for their DME equipment.  The Thales ATM, Inc. courseware is proprietary; the FAA does not have data rights to the courseware; the FAA will not provide courseware to vendors.  
The FAA requires that the provider conduct the classes on a daily one-shift basis, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, Monday through Friday.  Training will be continuous during these days except for federally established holidays.  3.  Incumbent Contractor The previous contract for this training was with Thales ATM, Inc.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for ongoing work and implementation of the (UnitedStates Agency for International Development) USAID SERVIR FY12-13 Work Plan.Additionally, this procurement is in response to a request from the USAID to perform LandUse Land Use Change Forest (LULUCF) mapping which will be a major input to the greenhousegas (GHG) inventories in six South African Development Community countries.NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from the Regional Center for the Mapping ofResources for Development (RCMRD) in Nairobi, Kenya. Competition is impractical for thefollowing reasons:1. RCMRD assumed the role of the host institution of SERVIR-Africa in 2008 and beganestablishing the framework for management and utilization of SERVIR-related environmentalinformation. Since that time, as the implementing arm of SERVIR-Africa, RCMRD has madesignificant progress in strengthening regional and national capacity to better takeadvantage of SERVIR, and in improving the technical infrastructure to manageenvironmental data and information generated through the SERVIR system Funding wasprovided to NASA from USAID under a Participating Agency Program Agreement (PAPA). USAIDapproved RCMRD for hosting and operating the SERVIR-Africa system, and supportscontinuation of RCMRDs engagement.2. This procurement is a follow-on for continuation of activities implemented under theexisting RCMRD contract which has been the implementing arm of SERVIR-Africa.3. USAID has already made a significant investment in the infrastructure at RCMRD withthe installation of USAID funded equipment (hardware and software) to build capacity tosatisfy the technical requirements.4. USAID in concert with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC) Secretariat and collaborating partners has specifically requested that RCMRD,under the auspices of SERVIR-Africa, be an implementer in the development of SustainableNational GHG Inventory Management Systems in the Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA)region, a major undertaking to address challenges in development of quality andsustainable national GHG Inventory Management System in the ESA region.5. SERVIR is a high-visibility project at NASA/MSFC, NASA/HQ and USAID.  It is also amodel implementation of the Global Earth Observation System of Systemsa multinationaleffort to build an earth observation system. This level of visibility further supportsthe need to continue engaging an institution such as RCMRD that is well recognized in thegeospatial community.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. centraltime on Wednesday, March 7, 2012.

STATEMENT OF WORK:
INTRODUCTION 
In October of 2011, to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty, Earth Cam, an internet based construction monitoring service based in New Jersey, donated and installed camera equipment on the Statue's torch for real time recording and transmission via the internet of images of New York Harbor, Ellis Island, the grounds of Liberty Island, and the torch itself.  Earth Cam also designed the web pages for display of what is now known as the Torch Cam (see below).  However, the company does not have the capability to broadcast this material over the internet. That must be done by, an internet service provider, which is the purpose of this requisition.
The Torch Cam was donated through the Statue of Liberty - Ellis Island Foundation. Since October 28th, when the Torch Cam went "live," four months of internet service were also donated, which will be up at the end of February, 2012.
Torch Cam has been extremely popular with the public and has become a useful tool in promoting the park and its programs, as well as the fundraising activities of our partners. It is an integral component of our New- and Social-Media program, and an efficient mean of connecting with underserved audiences. A similar effort is in place at the Flight 93 Memorial in Pennsylvania, and has been proposed for the Washington Monument. Activities such as this are supportive of the Director's Call to Action.

Liberty Island is a high level security zone, and access is only available by water transportation via public ferry from either Liberty State Park in Jersey City, New Jersey, or Battery Park in New York City. Special arrangements at other locations may be necessary for transportation of certain types of large equipment. In no case may the activities required for the accomplishment of these tasks cause inconvenience to park visitors. Pre- or post-operating hour access may be arranged if necessary. The vendor will be responsible for securing transportation.
DELIVERY
Installation of equipment on Liberty Island must be completed, and equipment made operational, to avoid any interruption of the existing service, in no case later than February 29, 2012.
GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY
The microwave dish will be installed on the existing NPS antenna on Liberty Island. No other government property, supplies or equipment will be available to the vendor.

6.  Firm's location in the general geographical area of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract. 

7.  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense (DOD) within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms.
 

The planned contract type is an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract where work will be ordered via task orders on an as-needed basis during the life of the contract provided the Government and the contractor agree on the amount.    Each task order will be a firm fixed price A-E contract.

<DESC>This announcement is for information only. The Bath VA Medical Center intends to award a contract for Architect/Engineer (A/E) Design Services to upgrade 3 identical elevators at this facility. The Medical Center will use the short selection process defined in FAR 36.602-5 (a). As such, VA intends to evaluate the technical qualifications of all A/E firms on file who have responded to competitive solicitations over the past 12 months and identify the three most highly qualified to perform this work. The geographic range being considered for this selection is 200 miles from 76 Veterans Avenue, Bath, NY, and only firms on file within that range will be considered. Existing information on file indicates that the only potential socio-economic set-aside within this geographic radius is 100% small business set-aside. If evidence of three service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB) or veteran-owned small businesses (VOSB) can be identified, however, a set-aside to these socio-economic categories will be considered. Firms wishing to be considered who are within the 200 mile radius but have not submitted a technical qualifications package within the past 12 calendar months may submit a SF 330s to the attention of Mark Simonson, Contract Specialist, VA Medical Center, 76 Veterans Avenue, Bath, NY 14810. Firms who have previously submitted qualifications need not resubmit. SDVOSB and VOSB A/E firms, with a working office within a 200 mile radius of Bath New York are encouraged to submit Standard Form (SF) 330's for consideration, listing qualifications. SF 330's must be received at the Syracuse VA Medical Center by close of business, March 6, 2012. The preferred method of submission would be electronic submission to Mark.simonson@va.gov.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Systematic Data Mining of the Medical Literature: A Novel Analytic Tool for Quantitative Drug-Adverse Event Safety Signal Detection</strong></p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice/Request for Information (RFI) is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 10, Market Research. It is for information, planning and market research purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration or its Centers. The purpose of this RFI is to help the FDA understand the industry best practices, technical solutions, and sources capable of meeting the FDA's requirements. Specifically, the Government is seeking verification that its automated, auditable, quantitative data mining requirement is commercially available, determine if there are any questions about the FDA's requirements, determine if industry notes any omissions in the requirements, and information about sources available to meet the FDA's requirements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sources Sought</span></p>
<p>Another purpose of this Sources Sought Notice/RFI is to determine the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (including Small Business Administration Certified 8(a) companies; firms in Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone); Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small businesses; and Women-Owned small businesses).</p>
<p>FDA welcomes responses from all interested parties.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></p>
<p>Our aim is to data mine the structured data in the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) electronic scientific literature database, MEDLINE, to detect potential drug-adverse event associations. We seek a verifiable, automated, and fully auditable program capable of quantitative signal detection, where drug-event pairs that occur in disproportionately higher-than-expected frequency are identified. The program should also be capable of visual workflow diagrams of the analysis process, drilling-down to provide access to the source literature articles, and linking to other electronic scientific resource databases that provide scientific data relevant to the biologic plausibility of the identified signal. We prefer data mining programs based on the multi-item gamma poisson -shrinker (MGPS) computational and statistical algorithm for systematically identifying such drug-event pairs (*1). FDA will also consider other approaches to quantitative data mining.<br /><br />We plan to establish an interagency agreement to collaborate with the NLM to map the medical subject headings (MeSH) terms used for indexing of citations in MEDLINE with adverse events terminology in MedDRA and to map the drug names used in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System to RxNorm. After we have validated the mapping process, a contractor will be expected to provide either a commercial off-the-shelf software product or a web-based program capable of loading and transforming the structured mapped MEDLINE data, generating the quantitative data mining outputs, providing an audit trail of the process, and providing integrated statistical and visual display tools (such as heat maps or sector maps) to allow users to explore the data, identify potential drug-event associations, and access the literature articles that underpin the identified signals.&nbsp; <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements</span></p>
<p>The Government requires an automated quantitative data mining application for electronic medical literature databases with audit trail capability. The Government requires a system that has "drill-down" capability to identify and access the original resource materials and provides links to other relevant scientific electronic databases. A software interface that provides graphical display, such a sector maps, is also required. The Government will also require contractor to provide system maintenance, monitoring, and upgrades (as they are released).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions</span></p>
<p>Interested parties shall provide responses to the following requested information:</p>
<p>1. Is FDA's desired verifiable, automated, and fully auditable program available commercially or commercially available with enhancement, customization, or configuration? <br />2. What is the capability to accommodate an electronic database containing greater than 10 million documents?<br />3. Describe the architecture of the Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) product to be used. <br />4. Describe the hosting capability at the contractor's facility. <br />5. Can the electronic structured literature data be updated to reflect new published literature articles?<br />6. What is the contractor's ability to update the MeSH terms to MedDRA mapping?<br />FDA will require this to be done at least two times a year. <br />7. What is the contractor's ability to update the ATC and RxNorm mapping?<br />FDA will require this to be done at least two times a year. <br />8. Can mock-ups or screen shots of the user-interface and results screens of the proposed COTS product be provided?<br />9. Can this work be done with a Fixed Price contract? What type of contract is recommended for the services specified?<br />10. In the event an RFP is issued, what supporting documentation do you require to be released with the RFP to obtain a better understanding of the requirements and FDA environment?<br />11. What is the recommended Period of Performance (POP)? Please provide a high level explanation of activities required supporting the recommended POP. 12. Provide a statement or summary of the firms' capability of providing all of the tasks summarized in Attachment 1 - Statement of Tasks.<br />13. Provide the following information to demonstrate your company's capabilities:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Provide a brief narrative of experience providing this type of service (commercial or Government).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Provide a brief narrative describing the firm's experience of pharmacovigilance surveillance systems.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Provide specific experience of providing a comparable tool that has had the capability of automated quantitative data mining of a large electronic database.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Provide specific experience of developing automated quantitative data mining applications with audit trail and "drill-down" capabilities. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Provide a statement confirming if the company has previous experience delivering services compliant with HIPAA or FDA security regulations.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Provide size of company.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Provide potential teaming arrangement (name of subcontractor not required, capabilities of teaming partner is required).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; h. Provide experience with user interface for Section 508 compliance.<br /><br />Note: Requests for specific experience requires respondents to provide agency names and a brief scope of work.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK</span></strong></p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>A comprehensive research program to assess the abundance and spatial distribution of marine mammals, sea turtles, and sea birds in US waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean has been established as an inter-agency agreement (IA) between the Bureau of Ocean Energy&nbsp;Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) and NOAA National Marine Fisheries&nbsp;Service (NOAA Fisheries Service).  The research program is called Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS).</p>
<p>The goal of AMAPPS is to coordinate the data collection and analysis efforts of the NOAA Fisheries Service Northeast and Southeast Fisheries Science Centers and the US Fish and Wildlife Service Division of Migratory Birds to accomplish six primary objectives:<br />1) Collect broad-scale data over multiple years on the seasonal distribution and abundance of marine mammals (cetaceans and pinnipeds), sea turtles, and sea birds using direct aerial and shipboard surveys of coastal US Atlantic Ocean waters;<br />2) Collect similar data at finer scales at several (~3) sites of particular interest to NOAA partners using visual and acoustic survey techniques;<br />3) Conduct telemetry studies of sea turtles, pinnipeds and seabirds to develop corrections for availability bias in the abundance estimate and to collect additional data on habitat use and life-history, residence time, and frequency of use;<br />4) Explore alternative platforms and technologies to improve population assessment studies;<br />5) Assess the population size of surveyed species at regional scales; and<br />6) Develop models and associated tools to translate these survey data into seasonal, spatially-explicit density estimates incorporating habitat characteristics.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Protected Species Branch (PSB) of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) for the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a requirement for data from satellite tags on 20 juvenile and adult loggerhead sea turtles in the southern U.S. Mid-Atlantic region, ideally off of Virginia and northern North Carolina.  Additionally, the requirement includes additional work to assess sea turtle availability bias by 1) conducting experimental detection trials, 2) comparing estimates of availability bias based on aerial survey data verses satellite tag data,  and 3) using simulations to evaluate various methods for combining sea turtle behavior and line transect data.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>As a part of the AMAPPS initiative, the NEFSC seeks to obtain information from 20 satellite tags on loggerhead sea turtles captured (via dipnet or other appropriate means) in nearshore or inshore Mid-Atlantic waters.  NEFSC wants to improve the estimation of availability bias for loggerhead sea turtles in Mid-Atlantic waters.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the personnel and materials necessary to perform the following services in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p>Supply data from satellite tags on 20 loggerhead sea turtles tagged in Mid-Atlantic waters off Maryland through northern North Carolina.</p>
<p>Capture, sample, handle, and tag twenty (20) loggerhead turtles in accordance with the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Task 1.  Contractor Vessel Requirements</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide  a seaworthy vessel for capturing and sampling loggerheads in offshore waters.  The vessel  shall be:</p>
<p>1.	Capable of staying offshore for ten (10) sampling days, <br />2.	Possess a small deployable inflatable boat for turtle capture, <br />3.	Provide a method to transfer the turtle onto the deck of the contractor vessel, <br />4.	Possess  a sighting platform that is raised higher than the main deck to ensure juvenile and adult loggerhead turtles can be sighted from a distance <br />5.	Possess a flat main deck that is large enough to complete the biological sampling. <br />6.	The vessel shall be available for a sufficient number of days to capture 15 loggerheads or a maximum requirement of 10 sampling days.</p>
<p>Task 2.  Contractor Sampling Gear Requirements</p>
<p>The contractor shall supply all necessary gear to sight, capture, tag, and sample 20 loggerhead sea turtles.  Satellite tagging protocols shall describe the protocols which will be used to provide a thorough cleaning of the carapace prior to tag attachment.  Satellite tags shall be attached to the loggerhead turtles using AnchorFix-1 epoxy.  Additionally, the contractor vessel shall have the following gear:</p>
<p>capture gear (dip net, etc), <br />binoculars, several small golf cart sized tires and other appropriate restraint devices, disposable gloves, <br />phlebotomy supplies for taking approximately 12 ccs from the turtle and separating it into 1 red topped vacutainer, 2 green topped vacutainers, 2 HVC tubes, 2 ISTAT cartridges, and 4 glass slides; <br />one standard and one microhematric centrifuge; <br />cooler for storage and shipping, <br />a refractometer for measuring total blood solids, <br />sharps container, <br />a thermometer for measuring cloacal temperature, <br />a stopwatch, <br />a Doppler device for monitoring heart beat, <br />flexible and rigid measuring devices for providing curved and straight measurements, <br />a scale suitable for medium and large loggerheads (roughly 50 cm CCL to 100 cm CCL), cleaning supplies which includes   Betadine, alcohol, and sterile cotton wipes) for preparing a sterile area, <br />flipper tags and applicator, <br />PIT tag scanner, applicator,/tags, biopsy punches and vials with DMSO, <br />instruments to scrape keratin and vials for storage and shipment, <br />vials to store and ship epibionts,  <br />thermometers for measuring air and water temperature, <br />camera for taking digital pictures, supplies to clean the carapace and apply the satellite tag  which shall include scrubbing pads, metal putty knives, rough and fine grit sandpaper, acetone, caulk gun, 2 tubes of AnchorFix-1 epoxy per turtle, rags, wooden tongue depressors, brightly colored electric tape, paper towels, rags and, and extra batteries for all electronic equipment.</p>
<p>Depending on the vessel, it may be necessary to provide a canopy or other shading device so that the sea turtle can be shielded from the sun or light rain while on board the vessel.   It is suggested that  a portable ISTAT and multiple hand-held VHF radios be supplied.  Ideally the contractor would have an existing ESA permit which covers the capture, sampling, handling, and tag application.</p>
<p>Task 3.  Contractor Vessel Capture, Sample, and Tagging Procedures</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this, the contractor shall supply a minimum of four (4) qualified contractor vessel crew personnel.  In past work when we captured turtles via dipnet, we needed AT LEAST four qualified personnel (but we always operated with more).  When in the presence of turtles, one  contractor vessel crew member shall operate the large vessel, one contractor vessel crew member shall stationed in a crow's nest and use binoculars to keep track of the location of a turtle and communicate its position to both vessel operators, one contractor vessel crew member  shall operate the small vessel, and one contractor vessel crew member  shall be stationed in the small vessel and operate the dip net. Both  contractor vessel crew personnel in the small vessel shall have substantial upper-body strength in order to move the large dip net through the water and to capture a large loggerhead turtles.  Captured loggerhead turtles may be heavy  at approximately 250 lbs.) and large at  approximate 100 cm curved carapace length.  The contractor shall provide details about how turtles will be boated and released safely in the scientific approach.  After the loggerhead turtle is captured, the contractor personnel  shall safely bring the turtle on board to harmlessly and efficiently handle, sample, and tag the loggerhead turtle.  When loggerhead turtles are on board, the contractor shall provide the personnel to have  one data recorder, one turtle handler, and one turtle sampler, and one turtle tagger working as a team.  If more than one turtle is brought on board the contractor vessel, the contractor shall increase the number of turtle handlers and samplers.  The contracted staff shall have passed an approved fishing vessel safety course, which includes having been trained by a USCG certified trainer.  NMFS may supply one person to assist with capture.</p>
<p>The contractor shall capture, sample, and tag 15 loggerhead sea turtles in nearshore Mid-Atlantic waters, within 2-20 miles offshore of Maryland through northern North Carolina.    The timeframe for proposed capture and sampling shall be justified.  An ideal time for the fieldwork (capture, sampling, tagging) may be in early in May as loggerheads begin to migrate into the area.  The size distribution of captured loggerheads shall be roughly proportional to the size distribution of loggerheads inhabiting the Mid-Atlantic nearshore waters.</p>
<p>The handling and sampling for the fifteen (15) near shore loggerheads shall include the following:  <br />Epibiota removal; <br />Count and survey; <br />Instrument and epoxy attachment  which includes the satellite tag); <br />Mark and flipper tags; <br />Mark and PIT tag; <br />Measurements; <br />Photograph and Video; <br />Blood sample and analysis for health assessment; <br />Blood samples and  preparation for subsequent stable isotope analysis; Fecal Sample; <br />Scute Scraping Sample (for subsequent stable isotope analysis); <br />Tissue Sample which shall include including skin for subsequent stable isotope and genetic analysis; <br />Handle, hold, and transport; <br />Weight; <br />Monitor and record heartbeat, <br />Cloacal temperature, <br />possible Cloacal lavage, <br />Lesion swab, <br />Clean pre-existing wounds.</p>
<p>Once the above duties are complied with, the contractor shall return the turtles safely to sea, and submit the biological samples to NEFSC for processing as directed by the COTR.</p>
<p>Task 4 Data Collection</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a complete dataset from  five (5) additional satellite tags deployed on loggerheads in inshore or nearshore Mid-Atlantic waters between Maryland and northern North Carolina.  The contractor shall provide the satellite tags and pay the ARGOS fees for these 5 turtles.  To fulfill this portion of the contract, the contractor may supply data from tags previously deployed since January 2010) or tags that will be deployed in the future, so long as they are deployed prior to October 1, 2012.  Tags deployed between March 2011 and April 2012 are preferred because this time period coincides with other NEFSC satellite tagging efforts)  It is ideal but not necessary for the contractors to supply sample these 5 turtles according to the same protocols used to sample the 15 nearshore turtles (as above).  The contractor-supplied satellite tag dataset must provide the average and standard deviation duration for surfacing events and for dive events.  Additionally the contractor satellite tag datasets must provide the average percent of time spent within the top meter and within the top two meters.  It is very strongly preferred that the tags provide all of the same information, in the same format, as is being provided by other tags funded by the NEFSC (&gt;50 tags, all of which are built by Sea Mammal Research Unit and parameterized similarly).  The parameterization of satellite tags used to support the 2011 loggerhead abundance estimate (NEFSC SEFSC 2011) can be found in the appendix of "2010 Annual Report to the Inter-Agency Agreement M10PG00075/0001: A Comprehensive Assessment of Marine Mammal, Marine Turtle, and Seabird Abundance and Spatial Distribution in US Waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean" by the NEFSC and SEFSC, available from NEFSC, Heather Haas, 166 Water Street, Woods Hole, MA 02543.</p>
<p>Task 4.  Samples and report</p>
<p>The contractor shall send samples, supply data, and write a draft and final report.</p>
<p>Contractors shall use a NMFS-supplied data sheet template for the non-telemetered data.  Completed datasheets should be transferred to electronic format and returned to NMFS in hardcopy (original or photocopy) format as well as in electronic spreadsheet format.  Flipper tag information should be reported directly to the Cooperative Marine Turtle Tagging Program (with CC to NEFSC).  All telemetered tag data will be uploaded into a NMFS Oracle database.  The contractor shall send biological samples (blood, skin, keratin, epibionts, etc.) to the appropriate contacts, as determined by NMFS.</p>
<p>3.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance (for the base) shall be 1 year from the date the contract is awarded.</p>
<p>4.  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS and DATA AGREEMENTS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a report on vessel suitability and readiness that consists of documentation of chartered vessel and suitability of vessel and crew to facilitate study objectives.</p>
<p>The Contractor must provide weekly reports to the COTR summarizing the research efforts during the time the fieldwork is being completed. Additionally, the contractor shall provide updates on the progress when requested. All data must be provided when requested and at the conclusion of the study.</p>
<p>The contractor shall produce a final report which includes the methods used for capture, handling, and sampling; the data collected; a discussion on any unusual or unexpected events, as well as a list of recommendations for improving similar projects in the future.  So long as the essential information (above) is included, the report may be brief and does not need to be in journal format.  Quantitative analysis is not being requested in the final report.  A draft of the final report shall be submitted to NEFSC within 45 days after the completion of fieldwork. The final report shall be submitted to NEFSC within 45 days after Contractor's receipt of the draft report back from NMFS/NEFSC. Both the final report and its draft shall be delivered in electronic format to the COTR at the Protected Species Branch, NEFSC, 166 Water Street, Woods Hole, MA 02543. All submitted products will be reviewed by the COTR for completeness within 45 days of receipt by NMFS/NEFSC.</p>
<p>All data released to NEFSC by the contractors in this base project will become the property of NEFSC, and NEFSC will have exclusive publication rights to this data for the first three years after the completion of this project.  NEFSC will invite the contractors to collaborate on the subsequent analysis and development of manuscripts (to be submitted to peer-reviewed journal).  The contractors are not obligated to collaborate on subsequent manuscripts, and it is not anticipated that there will be funds to support this portion of the collaboration.</p>
<p>II. OPTION ITEM REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>5.  OPTION ITEM</p>
<p>Optional Item Contract Line Item (CLIN) 0002</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Producing reliable abundance estimates is a key component of the protected species stock assessment plan (NMFS 2004).  In 2011 the SEFSC and NEFSC worked jointly under the Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS) to produce a preliminary abundance estimate of loggerhead turtles from Maine through Florida (NEFSC SEFSC 2011).  The estimation of the surface abundance was calculated using the computer program Distance (version 6.0, release 2, Thomas et al. 2009). The AMAPPS study is unique because of its broad scale and the explicit use of contemporaneous sea turtle surfacing patterns to model availability bias.  If sea turtles are not available to be seen by aerial survey observers because they sea turtles are diving deep below the surface, the abundance estimate will be negatively biased unless sea turtle behavior is incorporated into the analysis.  Availability bias  is a substantial source of bias (Marsh and Sinclair 1989); analytic methods for assessing availability bias should be developed and incorporated into the analysis of line transect data (Buckland et al 2004).</p>
<p>Although line transect methods are often applied to marine animals (Buckland et al 2004), application of these methods to sea turtles has been minimal in comparison to marine mammals.  There are several factors which make it difficult to model sea turtle availability bias and to combine sea turtle surfacing behavior with aerial survey data.  Sea turtle surfacing behavior is highly correlated to environmental conditions (perhaps more so than endothermic marine mammals) and differ by an order of magnitude in space or time (NEFSC SEFSC 2011); sea turtles are relatively small and do not have large (whale blow) cues to aid in detection; and sea turtles can have very long dives.  Typical methods (such as double platform) may be insufficient to estimate the abundance of long-diving animals because these animals can be completely missed while the observers pass (Okamura 2006).  In marine mammal simulations, when diving time was long, the magnitude of bias can be nearly 50% and the interval between the 5th and 95th percentiles did not include the true population size (Okamura 2011).  There are several methods (Laake et al 1997, Schweder et al 1999, Okamura et al 2011, Skaug et al. 2004; also see Buckland et al 2004) which could potentially be used or modified to model sea turtles well, but the appropriateness of these methods for sea turtle applications can only be accessed through simulation modeling.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>When discussing the shortcomings of the preliminary 2010 loggerhead abundance estimates, NEFSC and SEFSC (2011) recommended that more experiments be conducted to determine the approximate depth at which loggerheads are available to be detected by aerial observers.  In addition to depth, sea turtle availability to aerial observers may be related to other variables such as turbidity and their orientation in the water (angle of ascent/descent).  According to existing satellite tag data, loggerheads in the Mid-Atlantic are dry and at the surface ~ 10% of the time; &lt;1m deep ~33% of the time, and 1-2 m deep ~ 7% of the time.  We suspect that under certain conditions, turtles may be available to be seen within the first 0.5 m and under other conditions (offshore) turtles may be available to be seen within the first 2 meters.  Because so much time is spent near the surface, it is important to clarify what proportion of the near-surface animals are available to be detected.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The primary objective of  CLIN 0002, is to assess sea turtle availability bias by 1) conducting experimental detection trials, 2) comparing estimates of availability bias based on aerial survey data verses satellite tag data, 3) using simulations to evaluate various methods for combining sea turtle behavior and line transect data.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTES</p>
<p>Task 1: Experimental Detection Trials</p>
<p>The contractor shall deploy twenty (20) model turtles in turbid areas  which includes the Chesapeake Bay and in clearer areas  which includes the Mid-Atlantic offshore at various depths and various angles.  The contractor shall repeatedly fly over the models with a survey plane and conduct the detection trials in accordance with  AMAPPS observing protocols.  Turbidity levels shall be estimated from satellite-derived data and other reliable sources.  Based on the experimental results, the depth at which turtles were available to be seen shall be estimated.  The contractor shall focus on assessing availability bias, which occurs when turtles are not available to be seen.  Perception bias occurs when turtles are available to be seen but are missed by observers and perception bias is accounted for in AMAPPS analysis by using double platform survey methods.</p>
<p>Task 2: Estimate availability bias</p>
<p>The contractor shall estimate availability bias using two methods.    The contractor shall duplicate sea turtle aerial surveys in the Mid-Atlantic region  in conjunction with line transect methodology to estimate availability bias.  The contractor shall utilize existing aerial survey data or plans for surveys in 2012.  The contractor shall propose additional  surveys to achieve a sample size capable of robustly estimating availability bias.  The survey work shall ideally occur in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region.</p>
<p>The contractors shall estimate loggerhead availability using existing satellite tag data.  This component will use data from the 20 (15+5) satellite tag data from the base section of this SOW and compatible tags previously deployed by the NEFSC.  In addition to calculating a point estimate and variability of availability bias from the satellite tag data, the contractor shall address the shortcomings of NEFSC SEFSC 2011 by  analyzing the spatial, temporal, and individual variability in surfacing behavior.</p>
<p>Task 3: Evaluate methods for modeling availability bias</p>
<p>The contractor shall use simulation modeling to evaluate various methods for combining sea turtle behavior and lines transect data.    The contractor shall build a simulation model with a range of sea turtle surfacing patterns and use the model to test several methods for incorporating availability bias into line transect methods.  The results shall provide information on which methods are best suited to sea turtle applications.</p>
<p>5b. Optional Item CLIN 0003</p>
<p>Task 1:  Experimental detection trials</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct experimental detection trials and analyze data to determine the depth at which turtles were available to be seen and its relationship to turbidity levels.  The protocols used by the flight crew shall be similar to the AMAPPS protocols, including flight attitude..  The contractor shall supply an appropriate airplane  pilot,  two (2) to four (4) observers, and  one (1) to two (2) data recorders.  The contractors shall fabricate  twenty (20) variably-sized, 3-dimensional models of loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and green sea turtles.  The contractor shall create a subsurface anchoring system  to ensure turtle models can be reliably anchored at various depths.  Prior to the flight days, the contractor shall test the models to ensure the reliability of the anchoring system.  In order to deploy and retrieve the turtle models, the contractor shall supply a seaworthy and appropriate vessel].  The contractor shall provide all necessary safety equipment for all contracted personnel and one NOAA representative (should NOAA choose to send a representative).  Prior to analysis, the contractor shall enter all data into an electronic spreadsheet, and perform quality control checks on the data.</p>
<p>Task 2:  Estimate availability bias</p>
<p>The contractor shall estimate loggerhead availability bias from aerial survey versus the satellite tag data.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide data from duplicate sea turtle aerial surveys in the Mid-Atlantic regions to estimate sea turtle availability bias by using line-transect survey methodologies.   If additional flights are required to estimate the loggerhead availability bias, the contractor shall provide the necessary material and labor.  Additionally, the contractor d shall follow AMAPPS protocols (as described in NEFSC SEFSC 2011.  to the extent possible).</p>
<p>The contractor shall estimate loggerhead availability using existing satellite tag data. In addition to calculating a point estimate (and variability) of availability bias from the satellite tag data, the contractor shall address the shortcomings of NEFSC SEFSC 2011 by also analyzing the spatial, temporal, and individual variability in surfacing behavior.</p>
<p>Task 3:  Evaluate methods for modeling availability bias</p>
<p>The contractor shall use simulation modeling to evaluate methods for combining sea turtle behavior and line transect data.  In this component, the contractor shall build a simulation model with a range of sea turtle surfacing patterns and use the model to test at least 3 methods for incorporating availability bias into line transect methods.  The results shall provide information on which methods are best suited to sea turtle applications.</p>
<p>5c. Period of Performance (OPTION PERIOD)</p>
<p>The period of performance (for the option) shall be 2 years from the date the contract is awarded.</p>
<p>5d. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS and DATA AGREEMENTS (OPTION)</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a report on aircraft and vessel suitability and readiness that consists of documentation of chartered craft and suitability of craft and crew to facilitate study objectives. Report shall be delivered not later than 7 days prior to start of fieldwork.</p>
<p>The Contractor must provide weekly reports to the COTR summarizing the research efforts during the time the fieldwork is being completed. Additionally, the contractor shall provide updates on the progress when requested. All data must be provided when requested and at the conclusion of the study.</p>
<p>The contractor shall produce a final report which includes a detailed description of the methods (including a copy of all the statistical and simulation code), raw data (in electronic format), results, and list of recommendations for future research.  So long as the essential information (above) is included, the report may be brief and does not need to be in journal format.</p>
<p>A draft of the final report shall be submitted to NEFSC within 18 months after the completion of fieldwork. The final report shall be submitted to NEFSC within 45 days after Contractor's receipt of the draft report back from NMFS/NEFSC. Both the final report and its draft shall be delivered in electronic format to the COTR at the Protected Species Branch, NEFSC, 166 Water Street, Woods Hole, MA 02543. All submitted products will be reviewed by the COTR for completeness within 45 days of receipt by NMFS/NEFSC.</p>
<p>All data and results from this shall become the property of NEFSC, but publication rights will be jointly held by the contractors and NEFSC for the first three years after award of this contract.  The contractors are under no obligation to prepare manuscripts intended for submission to peer reviewed journals, and it is not anticipated that there will be funds to support this portion of the collaboration.  If the contractors choose not to participate in the development of manuscripts to submit to peer review journals, authorship standards (typical in the scientific community) should be followed.  This will&nbsp;likely result in the contractors being the lead authors and NEFSC being secondary coauthors.  If the contractors choose not to participate in the development of manuscripts to submit to peer review journals, the NEFSC will prepare the manuscripts and invite the contractors as coauthors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.  SPECIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (BASE and OPTION).</p>
<p>The COTR has determined that the final report to be delivered under this contract comes under Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-554), also known as the federal Information Quality Act of 2002.  Consequently, there are additional requirements for documenting methods and providing data.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the electronic copy of the final contract report from the COTR, the NEFSC Editorial Office will subject the report to the NEFSC's standard scientific and technical manuscript review procedures in order to assure the quality of the data and information in the report.  Based upon the NEFSC's review of the report, the NEFSC Editorial Office can request additional documentation from the contractor to assure the quality of the data and information in the report.  The contractor is obligated to provide any such requested additional documentation.  In particular, when preparing a final report on research activities and/or findings, an effort should be made by the contractor to fully document the methods (including any statistical analysis) and to fully cite the references associated with the research.</p>
<p>By acceptance of this award, the contractor or recipient of this contract agrees to convey to the Government and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide right to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and distribute copies of the full and final report to the public.</p>
<p>7.  QUALITY ASSURANCE/PROGRESS/COMPLIANCE</p>
<p>The COTR will be responsible for determining that the work is performed as required.  This is based on monitoring the progress of projects to which the contracted personnel are assigned.</p>

VISN 1 Contracting is conducting market research on DataPaq A6 High Speed Rack Scanner with Cryoprotection.  We are looking for potential distributors of the DataPaq A6 High Speed Rack Scanner with Cryoprotection.  Please see the following product information and salient characteristics below.
Product Information/Salient Characteristics
DataPaq A6 High Speed Rack Scanner with Cryoprotection (Part number #: ZTS-A6-80)
The A6-sized scanner is currently our most popular product. It offers easy set up, straight out of the box, and with only a few minutes needed for configuration of our DataPaq software, you'll be ready to start scanning in no time at all. A one-time automatic calibration means that you'll then be set up and ready to read any and all tubes, including Micronic, Matrix, Nunc, Abgene, REMP and many more. 

Cryoprotective Coating to Eliminate Condensation
The A6 scanner is also available with cryoprotective proofing, to avoid condensation build-up within the scanner.  Condensation can prevent the scanner from reading the 2D barcodes properly.  Therefore, if you will be regularly scanning tubes straight from the freezer, the cryoprotective proofing could be the solution for you.  Read more about our cryoprotection to eliminate condensation here"

Our A6 is fully integratable into robotics platforms. Base plates, such as that for the TECAN Evo (below, right) are also available.

different stroke lengths.
"	Easy adjustment - The tamp pad can be adjusted in alignment with the peel-off plate using four screws. Processing control is optimized during testing using the operation panel.
"	Pre-dispense button - Tests the labeling function. Pushing the button the first time causes the label to be printed and held by the pad. Pushing the button again starts the application.

It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.

<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 6, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-079-7905<br />Name:		Package Sealing Tape, Tan<br />Description:	3" wide x 60 yd long, 2.2 ml thick, 3" core tan package sealing tape. Tape is bi-axially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) with Type-1 plastic film backing. UOI is RO. RO = 1 Roll.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>

<DESC>This announcement is a FAR 5.205(c) Special Notice to request industry review of the posted draft solicitation content. No proposals are requested at this time. The draft consists solely of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and sample bid schedule for one of the three covered regions, without estimated quantities or other content at this time, including additional regulation-driven clauses. The draft solicitation is an additional step being taken to develop the best terms possible for all parties due to the potential action covering what previously has been under multiple smaller contracts by DLA Disposition Services sites, with therefore a substantial shift in the proposed line item structure and terms to fully address the varying needs of the smaller sites, but without an overly cumbersome array of line items and terms.
<p>This potential procurement was first researched as Sources Sought announcement SP451012SS0007 posted on 12/06/2011. Responses to that announcement indicate that a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside is anticipated, subject to internal approvals prior to an actual solicitation for responses to include prices and other proposal content. Note the terms of this set-aside provide for substantial participation by other firms besides the contemplated three possible SDVOSB awards by region. The applicable clause in 52.219-27 -- Notice of Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance will be spent for employees of the (SDVOSB) concern or employees of other SDVOSB firms, with joint ventures also eligible for consideration, subject to additional specifics in the clause. The remaining 50% of the subcontracting opportunity is eligible for all firms.</p>
<p>Comments and questions are invited, with a due date of 20 Mar 2012. An amended notice is not anticipated after responses are received, to post&nbsp;responses to all submitted questions and comments. But all input will be fully considered in any&nbsp;actual solicitation for complete proposals&nbsp;issued as a result of this effort.</p>

<a href="mailto:cheryl_mockford@fws.gov">cheryl_mockford@fws.gov</a>
<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to award a Sole-Source contract  to Olofson Environmental, Inc. of 2612 A 8th St. Berkely, Ca, 94710.  The contract will be for bird surveys.  The project titled Marshbird Monitoring in the San Francisco Estuary requires a significant number of survey (75) within less than 3 months.  The work requires that access to all federal and non-federal lands for surveys have been acquired, federal and state endangered species/recovery permits are current, and have trained and permitted staff are available to meet project requirements.  Olofson Environmental, Inc. is the only known source that can meet Agency requirements at this time. The marsh bird survey project requires the expertise of trained and permitted California Clapper Rail surveyors to begin surveys by Feb. 1, 2012. Olofson Environmental has staff members that are already trained and permitted to survey for the federally endangered California Clapper Rail and they already have agreements in place to access all required public and non-public lands for surveys. It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer similar services that would meet these requirements, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The time sensitivity of the project makes it extremely unlikely that another company would be to obtain the required federal permits and access to field sites in time to begin surveys by March 1st.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley researchers have developed a wireless low-profile sensor that uses amagnetic field response measurement acquisition system to provide power to the sensor andto acquire physical property measurements from it. Unique to this sensor is the shape ofthe electrical tracesthat eliminates the need for separate inductance, capacitance, and connection circuitry.This feature gives the sensor a smaller circuit footprint to enable a smaller, flexible,and easy to fabricate sensor package. The shape of the electrical trace can be readilymodified to sense different physical properties. Also, arranging multiple low-profilesensors together can permit the wireless data acquisition system to read the responsesfrom all the sensors by powering just one of them.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley Research Center has developed a system to detect and locate atmosphericclear air turbulence (CAT) by means of a ground-based infrasonic array to serve as anearly warning system for aircraft. This system could augment existing systems such aspilot reports (PIREPs), airborne lidar, and airborne radar. The NASA system offers abenefit based on the fact that the existing electromagnetic methods lack targets at30,00040,000 ft and will not detect CAT. Because CAT and severe storms emit infrasoundthat propagates over vast distances through the Earths atmosphere, the Langley systemoffers an excellent early warning opportunity. The system has been able to detect knowneventssuch as detection of the launch of the Space Shuttle in Florida all the way fromVirginia. It also has correlated data with NOAAs PIREPs information.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

Contracting Activity:	Department of the InteriorNational Business Center/Acquisition Services Directorate				381 Elden Street, Suite 4000				Herndon, VA 20170
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved. 
This is a limited sources action to award a sole-source logical follow-on of the requirement for contractor support to conduct strategic deep-dives in support of the Department of the Interiors effort to develop and refine the detailed plan for the Information Technology (IT) Transformation. 
On December 14, 2010, the Secretary of the Interior issued Secretarial Order (SO) 3309, which calls for the centralization of all IT management and operations functions, including IT infrastructure assets, and all Clinger-Cohen functions (e.g. Records Management, Enterprise Architecture, Capital Planning, Privacy, and Cyber (IT) Security) under the Department Chief Information Officer (CIO).  The primary objective of the new IT organization will be to implement a dynamic new enterprise business model for delivering scalable IT products and services that are transparent and customer and mission focused. The consolidation of IT management, human resources, and Clinger-Cohen functions within the Office of the Secretary will be addressed in the first phase of the transformation process.
This Transformation is a multi-year program involving every facet of the Department and will realign how information technology is designed, priced, and delivered in support of DOI bureaus, offices, and approximately 80,000 end users.  This effort, supported at the Departments highest levels, will result in a 21st century service delivery organization that provides innovative technologies at lower cost to support DOI mission areas. This follow-on procurement will move DOI to an IT Service Management model for the delivery of IT services for the Information Technology Transformation Plan which will reflect a four-year implementation period.
Competition was sought and a Task Order awarded to McKinsey & Company Inc. Washington D.C., hereto after known as McKinsey, for contractor support to develop and refine the detailed plan that will ultimately achieve the DOI strategic goal to fundamentally restructure the way that IT services are delivered. The Task Order was issued against GSA Schedule Contract GS-10F-0118S under MOBIS Federal Supply Schedule SIN 874-1 Consulting Services.


The DOI currently has a sole-source logical follow-on requirement for McKinsey under GSA Schedule Contract GS-10F-0118S to conduct strategic deep-dives in areas identified in the deliverables provided by McKinsey in the initial development of the detailed plan for the DOI Information Technology Transformation. 
This sole-source logical follow-on action will result in awarding a Firm-Fixed-Price Task Order for the estimated amount of $2,500,000 and; therefore, requires Competition Advocate concurrence in accordance with policy number NBCM-ACQ-6900-015.
3.	A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agencys Needs (including the estimated value).
On July 28, 2011, a Task Order was competitively awarded under the authority of FAR 8.401 Multiple-Award Schedule Program to McKinsey & Company Incorporated, Washington D.C. against GSA Schedule GS-10F-0118S.  The Department of the Interior, Office of Chief Information Officer required a contractor to review the current general Information Technology (IT) Transformation Plan and make any further recommendations, and support the Government in the development of a detailed IT Transformation Plan that will achieve this strategic goal by moving DOI to an IT Service Management (ITSM) model for the delivery of IT services.  
Task 1 - Developed the detailed project plans and schedules for implementing the DOI IT Transformation Program.  The project plan provided a significantly more detailed view of the tasks, milestones, predecessors, interdependencies, critical path and resource requirements required to achieve the objectives of the DOI IT Transformation Program.
Task 2 - The deliverables identified in the plan from Task 1 were developed. 
The eleven (11) deliverables under Task 2 were as follows: 
1.	Initial IT Service Portfolio and IT Service Catalog2.	Process and Criteria for Identifying and Prioritizing New Elements of the IT Service Catalog3.	Detailed IT Services Lifecycle and Governance Model4.	Financial Modeling Templates and Chargeback Models5.	Management Structure, Roles, and Responsibilities6.	Enterprise Asset Management Implementation Plan7.	Enterprise Service Desk Implementation Plan8.	IT Transformation Communications Strategy9.	Organization Change Strategy10.	Data Center Consolidation Strategy11.	Sourcing and Acquisition Strategy that supports the OMB Cloud First Directive
The purpose of this logical follow-on requirement is to obtain strategic deep-dive support from McKinsey & Company in six (6) specific areas.  The Department of the Interior is seeking a deeper assessment of opportunities that were identified in McKinseys initial deliverables.  Specifically, McKinsey will conduct deep-dives into the following areas:
1.	Management structure including roles and responsibilities: Additional development and refinement of the next level of roles and responsibilities for Service Delivery, and Support functions;2.	Sourcing and acquisition strategy: Build-out of cloud-specific sourcing and acquisition strategy and requirements definition in the context of a refined hosting strategy;3.	IT Services Lifecycle and Governance: Strategic deep-dive on performance management strategy, including roles/responsibilities and tools/dashboards; 4.	Financial modeling templates and chargeback model: Detailed refinement of pricing and roll-out strategies for financial chargeback model including development of simplified intermediate chargeback strategy;5.	IT Transformation communications strategy: Development of the next level of communications strategy detail for IT management community and senior Departmental leadership in the context of an updated detailed IT Transformation plan; and 6.	Datacenter consolidation strategy: Detailed strategic recommendations in the context of greater applications and data collection efforts and needs.The estimated amount of this logical follow-on requirement is $2,500,000.
4.	The Authority and Supporting Rationale. 
Orders placed under GSA Federal Supply Schedules are exempt from the competition requirements in FAR Part 6.  However, an ordering activity must justify its action when restricting consideration of GSA Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than required in FAR 8.405-1 or 8.405-2.
The applicable authority permitting to limit sources for this follow-on procurement is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C).  As cited in FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C) In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order or BPA must not have been previously issued under a sole-source or limited-sources procedures.   
The original Task Order was competitively awarded under the authority of FAR 8.401 Multiple-Award Schedule Program to McKinsey & Company against GSA Schedule GS-10F-0118S on July 28, 2011. The competition under the original Task Order included ten (10) vendors under SINs 874-1 Consulting Services and SIN 132-51 Information Technology Professional Services were solicited.  Five (5) quotes were received and thus, adequate competition was obtained.  McKinseys quote was determined to be the best value to the Government.  This determination was based on McKinsey being the vendor whose quote, in conforming to the Request for Quotation, provided the overall best value to the Government, technical and price considered.  McKinseys quote met the Governments objective in obtaining the highest technical quality considered necessary to fulfill the Governments requirement within a realistic and reasonable price.  It resulted in the best overall technical approach considering McKinseys management approach and technical capabilities, personnel qualifications, organizational experience, past performance and price to meet the Governments needs and with minimal to none performance risk to the Government.  
As stated in support of the award decision to McKinsey for the original Task Order, the end result of the initial requirement was to be a detailed IT Transformation Plan that will achieve the strategic goal of moving DOI to an IT Service Management (ITSM) model for the delivery of IT services. The contractor awarded this requirement must be an A-Caliber consulting firm that inspires confidence, and of the upmost integrity behind the outcomes of the deliverables. Therefore, the technical approach, capabilities and performance of the contractor are critical to this successful completion of the requirement. This rationale is the same for this logical follow-on requirement and thus, a sole-source award to McKinsey for the deep-dive in six (6) areas as indentified in the deliverables to the original Task Order is appropriate. 
5.	A Determination by the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer that the Order Represents the Best Value Consistent with 8.404(d).
The amount for the full Period of Performance of the follow-on award is estimated to be $2,500,000.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.404(d) GSA has already determined the price of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable.  Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing, except for a price evaluation as required by 8.405-2(d).
The Firm-Fixed-Price for these deliverables will be provided under the GSA Schedule. At a minimum the price will be determined fair and reasonable via the use of price analysis based on the comparison to prior engagements of similar size and scope, and comparing the price to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE), which will be documented in the Award Summary in the file. Based on this price analysis, the anticipated price represents the Best Value to the Government.
6.	A Description of the Market Research Conducted among Schedule Holders and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research was not Conducted.
Market Research was not conducted because a new competition would be impracticable. This requirement is suited to a logical follow-on in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C) as awarding to another source is likely to result in the disruption of the development of the detailed plan for the Information Technology (IT) Transformation. 
Through work on the original Task Order McKinsey has gained a unique insight and working knowledge of the DOIs IT Transformation Roadmap, and current state. Additionally, McKinsey has extensive experience with federal IT Transformations, specifically working with OMB to create the Federal CIOs 25-Point Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology Management. This plan which was created by McKinsey, and published by OMB and helps deliver more value to the American taxpayer by addressing the most pressing, persistent challenges faced by the Federal Government IT.  Finally, McKinsey will bring the necessary combination of expertise, relevant experience, tools and key personnel that makes McKinsey distinctively and uniquely qualified to meeting the particular needs of this requirement.
Awarding to a Contractor other than McKinsey could result in substantial duplication of effort and costs to the Government and would cause unacceptable delays. These costs would not expect to be recovered through competition. The Government has chosen to minimize its risk for the successful completion of the requirement by determining a logical follow-on to the original Task Order would be in the best interest of the Government. 
7.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification.
McKinsey previously provided support under Task Order D11PD40452 with the Performance Work Statement entitled Information Technology Transformation Detailed Planning, for the Chief Information Officer, Department of the Interior from August 2011 through February 2012.  The period of performance for Task Order D11PD40452 presumed that the government would no longer require contractor support. However, the need continues for this contractor to conduct a number of strategic deep-dives as a follow-on requirement. The Department was unaware that such opportunities for the additional strategic deep-dives would be identified during McKinseys performance of the original Task Order.  McKinsey possesses the specific knowledge required to perform this additional analysis successfully as a follow-on requirement to what was originally competed. 
8.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers that Led to the Restricted Consideration Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services is Made.
None,  no subsequent Acquisitions are anticipated and all deep dive subject areas currently identified are being provided for under this task order; if new areas are identified, a new competitive procurement will be conducted to fulfill any future requirements.

<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Patrick Staines, Contracting Officer, Phone (301)975-6335, Email patrick.staines@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b), with 4Wave, Inc. of Sterling, Virginia for the purchase of a SIMS end point detector for its existing 4Wave ion beam etch system to supplement its existing 4Wave ion beam etch system currently being used in NIST's Center for Neutron Science and Technology NanoFab.<br />&nbsp;
<p>NIST currently utilizes a 4Wave ion beam etch system in the Center for Neutron Science and Technology NanoFab. To ensure the continuity of laboratory experiments, as well to ensure the compatibility of the new SIMS end point detector with NIST's existing ion beam etch system and its existing software, as well as future components in the development of this system that are being contemplated, it is necessary that the SIMS end point detector be purchased from 4Wave.</p>
<p>The required 4Wave SIMS end point detector integrates with NIST's existing 4Wave ion beam etch system using a specific physical/geometrical configuration relative to the wafer which is proprietary to 4Wave. In addition, the 4Wave SIMS hardware is physically compatible with the part of the existing 4Wave system where it is to be installed, which was specifically machined to receive it. The 4Wave SIMS software is compatible with the existing Ion Beam Etch system software, which is also proprietary to 4Wave.</p>
<p>In addition, supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>4Wave, Inc. is the only contractor who can provide the SIMS end point detector that meets NIST's requirements. Therefore, 4Wave, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the required SIMS end point detector.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (Eastern) on March 6, 2012. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>1. The Government is considering implementing the 22 month (total) NGJ Technology Development (TD) contract in two parts: a base contract with an option. Each part of the contract is notionally planned to be 11 months in duration. This RFI will provide supporting information for the Government to assess the viability of this approach.
<p>2. The Government's decision as to whether to exercise the option would be informed by one (or more) interim assessment events known as "knowledge points". <br /><br />3. A "knowledge point" occurs when key information becomes available that indicates progress toward program goals. A "knowledge point" could be a discrete event or the culmination of multiple events. While focused on technical performance metrics (TPMs) and risk reduction, a "knowledge point" could also provide programmatic information.</p>
<p>Examples would include "knowledge points" supported by TPMs related to Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) and Weight. It is anticipated that vendor unique "knowledge points" and supporting TPMs exist as well.</p>
<p>4. The Government requests identification of potential "knowledge points" throughout the 22 month period of performance. Of most interest are those "knowledge points" that would inform the decision to exercise the contract option during the 22 month TD effort.</p>
<p>Your discussion of recommended "knowledge points" should include rationale as to their relevance to achieving the work identified in the NGJ draft specification and statement of work (SOW), previously offered for review via FEDBIZOPS notice published on 17 Jan 2012. The Government is interested in leveraging vendor planned "knowledge points" to perform assessments, not creating arbitrary decision points.</p>
<p>5. The Government requests the vendor identify how the TD contract work scope would be divided between the base and option to align with the recommended "knowledge points". The division of work should provide for an efficient transition between the contract base and option. While the duration of the base and option are notionally 11 months each, the contractor should recommend timing and duration to align with their "knowledge points".<br /><br />6. In conclusion, the Government requests that respondents provide the following by 28 Feb 2012 to Mary Dodds at mary.dodds@navy.mil:<br />a) Identification of relevant "knowledge points" - both the event and the prospective timing of that event (i.e. months after contract award)<br />b) Identify the technical performance measure(s), risk reduction information or other information associated with each such "knowledge point" <br />c) A description of the work scope division (basic contract versus contract option performance) that aligns with the "knowledge points" and discussion of performance efficiency impacts, if any, associated with said division. The response should include the duration of both the base and option, along with the timing of the option (i.e. months after contract award). <br />d) An overall assessment of the viability of the prospective option contracting approach</p>

The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.<br /><br />DoDAAC: As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code. This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense. Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.<br /><br />Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices. The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.<br /><br />(c) Options within WAWF include a "combo" for supply items, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a "stand-alone" invoice. It is recommended that the use of , stand-alone invoices be avoided. The matching of "stand-alone" invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified. The use of the "combo" or "2-in-1" does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .<br /><br />(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the "Send More E-Mail Notifications" link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1). This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice<br /><br />Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . For assistance in registering contact:<br />1-866-618-5988<br />COMMERCIAL: 801-605-7095 <br />CSCASSIG@CSD.DISA.MIL <br /><br />Helpful training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com.</p>
<p>(e) Questions concerning payments:</p>
<p>(1) DFAS Indianapolis at 1-888-332-7366. You will need to have the delivery/purchase/contract number ready when calling about payments.</p>
<p>(2) Payment and receipt information can be accessed at the DFAS website https://myinvoice.csd.disa.mil/. You will need to have the delivery/purchase/contract number or invoice number to inquire about the payment.</p>

<p>5.11. Includes historical scheduled flight data for the current month beginning (28 February 2012), eleven months in the future (data through 27 January 2013), and thirteen months of historical data (28 February 2012 - 27 January 2011).</p>

<p>The facsimile number listed above shall be used by contractors for ORIGINAL invoice submission only.  If facsimile submission is utilized, contractors shall not submit hard copies of invoices via the U.S. mail.

<p>Discounts on invoices.  If desired, the Contractor should offer discounts directly upon the invoice submitted, clearly specifying the terms of the discount.

<p>Discounts offered after invoice submission.  If the Contractor should wish to offer a discount on a specific invoice after its submission for payment, the Contractor should submit a letter to the Finance Center identifying the specific invoice for which a discount is offered and specify the exact terms of the discount offered and what time period the Government should make payment by in order to receive the discount.  The Contractor should clearly indicate the contract number, invoice number and date, and the specific terms of the discount offered.  Contractors should not structure terms for net amount payments any sooner than the standard period required under FAR Subpart 32.9 regarding prompt payments for the specified deliverables under contract.</p>
<p>d.  Payment Status: Contractors may inquire on the payment status of an invoice by any of the following means:</p>

All invoices must clearly correlate invoiced amounts to the corresponding contract line item number and funding citation.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Synopsis:<br /><br /></span></strong>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to procure second-generation AIT systems (AIT-2).&nbsp;&nbsp;The AIT-2 system provides Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) additional threat detection capabilities to locate potential threats concealed from view on a passenger. The AIT-2 system detects metallic and non-metallic anomalies such as weapons, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) components and plastic threats. Reduced-sized systems will provide an alternative to full-size systems to help reduce the AIT-2s overall footprint for smaller checkpoint configurations. &nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SSI:<br /></strong></span><br />Portions of this RFP contain Sensitive Security Information (SSI).&nbsp; All&nbsp;Contractors&nbsp;interested in responding to the AIT-2 solicitation must go through a vetting process and be approved to have access to SSI.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Contractors who have been successfully vetted under the Pre-Solicitation Notice instructions will have SSI sent to the given Senior Corporate Official e-mail address.&nbsp; <br /><br />Contractors that have not been vetted under the Pre-Solicitation Notice and are interested in responding to the AIT-2 solicitation should review the SSI Clearance Information <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within the attached RFP document</span>&nbsp;and respond as appropriate.&nbsp; Please note that the clearance process can take several weeks.<br /><br />Contractors&nbsp;that submit SSI vetting information prior to the deadline&nbsp;within the attached RFP document should receive correspondence from TSA by March 19, 2012 5:00 PM EST.&nbsp; Please e-mail the Primary and Secondary Point of Contact in this Solicitation Notice if a submission was made&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;the deadline in&nbsp;attached RFP document and the March 19, 2012&nbsp;date passes.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CNSI:<br /><br /></strong></span>Portions of this RFP contain Classified National Security Information (CNSI).&nbsp; Contractors must have a facility clearance (FCL) at the Secret level and a DD Form 254 from the Government.&nbsp; The Government will use the Contractor's CAGE code to determine the Contractor's FCL status.&nbsp; Only after receipt of DD Form 254 with appropriate FCL status will Contractors be&nbsp;provided (by mail)&nbsp;the related CNSI information.&nbsp; <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Pre-Solicitation Conference:<br /><br /></span></strong>An AIT-2 Pre-Solicitation Conference&nbsp;will be held on March 9, 2012 from 8:30 am to 12 noon at the TSA Systems Integration Facility (TSIF) in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;In order to attend, Contractors must be vetted and approved to have access to SSI because SSI will be presented at the Pre-Solicitation Conference.<br /><br />Those Contractors interested in attending the AIT-2 Pre-Solicitation Conference that have not been vetted under the&nbsp;Pre-Solicitation Notice should review the SSI Clearance Information <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within the attached RFP document</span> and respond as appropriate immediately in order to permit the initiation of the clearance process.&nbsp; Please note that&nbsp;while a best effort will be undertaken to complete the process, TSA does not guarantee completion of the clearance process, nor does TSA guarantee access to the AIT-2 Pre-Solicitation Conference for any Contractor which did not complete vetting and receive approval for access to SSI under the Pre-Solicitation Notice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Once approved for access to SSI, and no later than March 1, 2012, Contractors should provide the Primary and Secondary Point of Contact in this Solicitation Notice the names and phone numbers of no more than&nbsp;two (2)&nbsp;individuals cleared for access to SSI that plan on attending the AIT-2 Pre-Solicitation Conference.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>NOTE:&nbsp; All information above is considered the Solicitation Notice.&nbsp; All information below is considered the Pre-Solicitation Notice.<br /><br /></strong>Added: Dec 09, 2011 1:31 pm <br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), intends to compete its requirement for a second generation of Advanced Imaging Technology-2 (AIT-2). The AIT-2 system is used as a primary screening device to inspect a passenger's body for concealed weapons (metal and non-metal), explosives and other prohibited items. AIT takes into account passenger privacy considerations and employs safeguards to provide the maximum level of privacy protection to passengers. AIT is being upgraded to include Automated Target Recognition (ATR) capability which reduces privacy concerns and decreases passenger processing time. AIT-2 may also serve as a platform for potential integration of metal detection and/or shoe scanning capability.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

   (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
 
     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--

     (2) __ Outside the United States.
 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to clarify the period of performance and to publish all questions and responses received and provided to date. <br><br>(1) The baseline Period of Performance for Topic 01 is not to exceed 36 months. As anticipated Government funding is for FY12-14, offeror funded tasks and/or options that exceed the baseline 36 month period of performance may be proposed.<br><br>(2) Q & A<br><br>Question 1:  Understanding that a lot of effort has already been expended in this area, we would like to know if it is possible to have access to prior work or data that is owned by the Government?  <br><br>Response 1:  The Government has funded several active rotors efforts over the last 15 years+ and it is impractical to provide all the data directly to you.  It is our recommendation that you perform a Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) search to obtain the necessary background information and reports.<br><br>Question 2: What date should we assume program start for schedule and pricing purposes?<br><br>Response 2: It is the Government's intent to make an award by 30 June 2012<br><br>Question 3:  Does the USG require or desire full scale rotor testing? There appears to be conflicting statements: Paragraph1 states "Full scale rotor system level". Paragraph 5 states "Appropriately scaled rotor" What constitutes a full scale rotor?<br><br>Response 3:  The Government is interested in a relevant scale rotor system demonstration. It may be a full scale rotor or appropriately sized such that it limits scaling risks.<br><br>Question 4:  Does the USG reserve the right to select part of a proposal?<br><br>Response 4: Yes<br><br>Question 5:  Are options allowed and/or encouraged? <br><br>Response 5:  Yes<br><br>Question 6: If USG Wind Tunnel and Test hardware are proposed will cost/fees be GFE and if so will it be deducted from the awarded contract value? Who will be responsible for directing test activity and monitoring cost, schedule budget? Will USG utilize its own instrumentation resources for Acoustics (NASA), Performance, etc?<br><br>Response 6:  Any GFE costs will be paid for with the anticipated budget listed in the synopsis. Test direction, monitoring and instrumentation resources will be handled on a case by case basis.<br><br>Question 7:  If the offeror proposes to use a Government facility such as the NFAC, how should facility costs be incorporated in the proposal? Should the offeror request a quote from the facility manager and include it in the cost proposal, or should the offeror request an estimate from the facility manager, disclose the facility estimate in the proposal, but not include it in the cost proposal, or is a different way preferred?<br><br>Response 7: The cost proposal should substantiate the estimated cost of the proposed tasks. Substantiation may include direct quotes, estimates, previous similar efforts, etc.<br><br>Question 8: For evaluation of proposals, is there a priority or weighting for each of the four performance each of the 4 benefits identified? (Vibration, Acoustics, Figure of Merit, and rotor L/De)<br><br>Response 8:  No priority or weighting has been identified.<br><br>Question 9:  Will favorable consideration be given in proposal evaluation if hardware is designed and can be installed directly on a flight aircraft? If so how much?<br><br>Response 9:  Ability to use any program assets on a future effort is covered in evaluation criteria 3 (Ability to Transition Technology). Evaluation criteria 3 is less important than 1 (Relevance of the Proposed Technologies) and 2 (The Merit of the Proposed Technical Approach) but more important than 4 (The reasonableness of the proposed cost to the Government of the proposed tasks).<br><br>Question 10:  What are the End of Test Data reporting requirements and format (E-copy, hard copy etc?)<br><br>Response 10:  End of Test date reporting requirements are not set. The Government is open to offeror proposals on data delivery. Data delivery will be part of the negotiations for an award.<br><br>Question 11:  The BAA states that the technical volume shall contain "a draft program management plan." 1) What is AATD expecting? 2) Draft PMP can run approximately 20 pages or more. 3) Will the PM plan pages count against the Technical Volume 1 page count which is 50 pages maximum?<br><br>Response 11:  The Government is expecting a draft program management plan. The draft program management plan will not count against the Technical Volume 1 page count limit.<br><br>Question 12:  Will a proposal with a substantiated period of performance exceeding 36 months, but meeting full scale integrated rotor testing goals as stated in the BAA, be considered "non-responsive" to the subject BAA and therefore not be eligible for an award?<br><br>Response 12:  Proposals with POP exceeding 36 months will not be considered "non-responsive" or ineligible for award. The synopsis states "The Period of Performance for Topic 01 is not to exceed 36 months". Proposed options that span beyond the baseline 36 month POP will be considered. It should be noted that significant increases in period of performance may make the proposed effort of less value to the Government. The proposed program timeline is a factor in Evaluation Criteria 3 (Ability to transition technology).<br>

POC is CPT MICHAEL MIGNANO<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

POC is CPT MICHAEL MIGNANO<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<BR><BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>1) Facsimile number is: 757-413-7314</p>
<p>The facsimile number listed above shall be used by contractors for ORIGINAL invoice submission only. If facsimile submission is utilized, contractors shall not submit hard copies of invoices via the U.S. mail. It is the responsibility of the contractor to verify that invoices are received, regardless of the method of submission used. Contractors may inquire regarding the receipt of invoices by contacting the U.S. Coast Guard Finance Center via the methods listed in subparagraph (d) of this clause.</p>

Upon approval, the TSA will electronically route the invoices back to FinCen. Upon receipt of certified invoices from an Authorized Certifying Official, FinCen will initiate payment of the invoices.</p>
<p>Note for discounts offered:</p>
<p>Discounts on invoices. If desired, the Contractor should offer discounts directly upon the invoice submitted, clearly specifying the terms of the discount. Contractors can structure discounted amounts for payment for any time period less than the usual thirty day payment period specified under Prompt Payment requirements; however the Contractor should not structure terms for payment of net amounts invoiced any sooner than the standard period required under FAR Subpart 32.9 regarding prompt payments for the specified deliverables under contract.</p>

<DESC><p><br />1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>AFRL/RXQ conducts research on materials and technology for force protection of assets including, but not limited to, expeditionary and permanent structures, vehicles, aircraft, and personnel. The ability to provide expedient protection for these assets is critical for improving and sustaining agile airbase capabilities. Assets that are mobile or those with very small footprints (several hundred ft2) are not afforded adequate protection as a permanent protective structure would be cost prohibitive and may become an obstruction to operations should the asset need to be relocated. Expedient protective systems provide a versatile, re-deployable solution that can accommodate a wide variety of assets and offer timely protection to assets critical to the mission at hand.</p>
<p>For many of these small assets, efforts are focused on providing protection from rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) and mortars which often rely on shaped charges and small fragments to incur damage. Thus RPGs and mortars pose a severe threat to vulnerable assets which are important to the infrastructure and operations of an airbase. Protection can consist of sidewalls, roof and a pre-detonation layer. Structural sidewall protection is critical to provide protection from fragmentation, and it also supports the roof and potentially supports a pre-detonation layer. Use of a pre-detonation layer is one method employed to cause early detonation of the RPG/mortar threat before contact with the protection layer, thus reducing the effectiveness of the threat. To this end, RXQ seeks assistance in identifying existing materials capable of providing expedient protection from the aforementioned class of threat for mobile and fixed small footprint assets.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>Desired Technology Capability Specifics</p>
<p>This request is for the identification of sources that can supply expedient protective systems that provide sidewall and overhead protection to include pre-detonation capabilities. For this effort, sidewall protection is defined as a material or combination of materials that can afford fragmentation protection to an asset as well as support the load of an overhead protection component and/or pre-detonation layer, if needed. Overhead protection must provide a similar protection level as the sidewall protection, but may work in conjunction with a pre-detonation layer.</p>
<p>AFRL/RXQ is interested in systems that have the capability to effectively and efficiently provide protection from fragmenting munitions and small shaped charges. These systems must provide the aforementioned protection for assets with small footprints (&lt; 2000 ft2) and provide for expedient setup (erectable within 24 hours without the use of heavy machinery). Potential systems, components, and materials must be tested and proven to provide ballistic protection for one of two threats of interest; or both threats if an entire system is provided. The first threat is fragmentation with the ballistic protection required to be provided is equivalent to a 3,000 ft/s V50 for a 2 grain right circular cylinder (RCC). The second threat of interest is a small shape charge with the energy equivalent of &lt; 4 inches penetration in rolled homogenous armor (RHA). The small shape charge is the main overhead protection threat, and the fragmentation threat is for sidewall protection. Systems must also be proven to withstand wind speeds of at least 120 mph in accordance with UFC 3-310-01, 25 May 2005 including Change 2, on 5 December, 2007. It is desirable for systems or materials to also have been tested against shaped charge jets or similar threats. Systems sought are not limited to specific designs. For example, potential solutions may be retrofits that take advantage of mounting points on existing structural components on buildings or stand-alone units such as tents or supported walls to protect vehicles. Solutions for only one type of protection (e.g. sidewall, overhead, pre-detonation) will also be welcomed. System modularity is not required, but is highly desirable as it could be adapted to protect multiple assets. Cost of material and total system will be considered and therefore should be provided.</p>

<DESC><p>Data Fusion (DF), Cross Domain Solution (CDS) and User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) INDUSTRY DAY</p>
<p>The purpose of the Industry Day is to assist with the Development Planning for Data Fusion (DF), Cross Domain Solution (CDS) and User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) in support of the 624 Operations Center. The 624 OC requires full spectrum situational awareness of both kinetic and cyber space to effectively exercise command and control of cyber forces to support Air Force and Joint missions. In order to provide meaningful information that will enhance situational awareness, discrete variables are needed to be individually considered for correlation, aggregation, or other forms of analysis that will reduce the cognitive burden of operators and facilitate effective course of action (COA) development and decision making for classified and unclassified information. The Industry Day will be held in the MITRE Facility, Bedford, MA 01730. Specifics are provided in following paragraphs:</p>
<p>1. CONFERENCE: The conference will take place on 13-14 March 2012 from 0730 - 1800 hours (EDT) at the MITRE Facility, Bedford, MA 01730. The conference will be UNCLASSIFIED.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance is limited to no more than four (4) representatives per company. Companies/individuals must convey interest, POC and the names of individual(s) attending no later than 12:00 PM (EST) 27 February 2012.</p>
<p>Points of Contact: Dr. Tim Greene and Ms. Cassandra Carlson<br />Email: cassandra.carlson.ctr@hanscom.af.mil <br />Phone: 781-225-3179</p>
<p>2. MASS BRIEFING: The Capability Planning Division will give a mass briefing to all registrants regarding the DF, CDS and UDOP Development Planning effort beginning at 0800 on BOTH days. The mass briefing will be the same on both days; therefore there is only a need to attend one day.</p>
<p>3. ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS: The Capability Planning Division will entertain separate 30 minute one-on-one sessions. If you would like to discuss all three topics (UDOP, DF, and CDS) you will have to do so within 30 minutes. Due to time constraints, we have to stick to the scheduled 30 minutes. The sessions will be held between 0930-1800 hours, on 13 &amp; 14 March 2012. Interested parties must reserve a time slot. Time slots are on a first-come, first-reserved basis. Reservations must be made by 1200 hours ET, 27 February 2012 via the email address above. Please provide a primary time slot request and two alternate time slots. A confirmation e-mail with an information package will be sent once your slot has been confirmed. The audience will be government leadership, cyber engineers and program management leaders.

Youare notified that Organizational Conflicts of Interests (OCI) requirements are included. Request for Information Organizational Conflicts of InterestNASA/JSC is requesting information from industry regarding potential organizationalconflicts of interest (OCI) arising from the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle ProgramIntegration Contract (MPIC). The nature of the work anticipated under the MPIC may create a situation where therecould be the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizationaland Consultant Conflicts of Interest.  Each potential offeror should review FAR Subpart9.5, Organizational Conflicts of Interest in light of NASAs anticipation of OCI issuesand consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision tocompete for the MPIC.  Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the MPIC will include the followingtypes of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive.   Requirements definition for future hardware/software	development   Trade studies on program decisions that could affect	future procurements,budgets, and schedules	Access to other NASA contractors proprietary information	Access to NASA data not readily available to the public	Impaired ObjectivityA link to the NASA Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest has been posted to theMPIC procurement website at:  http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/mpcv/    .  Pleasereference this document for additional information about NASAs policies with respect toOCI issues.  You are requested to provide electronic responses via e-mail tojsc-mpic@nasa.gov.  Your response is requested by 4:00 p.m. local time on March 1, 2012. Potential offerors are requested to address the following questions: 1.	What type of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any,should you choose to propose on the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle Program IntegrationContract MPIC? 2.	What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues thatyou identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experiencewith other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc.3.	Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed MPIC thatwere not identified in this RFI (assuming any were identified)?4.	Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the MPIC that wouldcause you to decide not to propose on the potential MPIC RFP?NASA intends to assess any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offerorsproposed OCI mitigation strategy, responding to each company who submits a mitigationstrategy in writing.  NASAs response will simply be an attempt to preliminarily examinepossible circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI.  It will not be aconfirmation that, in fact, an OCI will ultimately exist or that an offeror cansuccessfully eliminate or mitigate an OCI.  Furthermore, the response in no way alters orinterprets the application of FAR 9.5, Organizational and Consultant Conflicts ofInterest as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission,should a potential offeror elect to submit a proposal in response to an RFP issued undera solicitation for MPIC.  Subsequent to the initial submission and response, theGovernment will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI.The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes,to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only.	NASA willnot affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public,but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy,and therefore such information may be recognizable to the potential offeror who submittedit.  Any information submitted in response to this RFI that is marked as ConfidentialCommercial or Financial Information will be considered as voluntarily submitted inaccordance with the Freedom of Information Act.The Government intends to release the names, addresses, and points of contact of allrespondents unless specifically requested not to do so by the respondent.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK</span></strong></p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>A comprehensive research program to assess the abundance and spatial distribution of marine mammals, sea turtles, and sea birds in US waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean has been established as an inter-agency agreement (IA) between the Bureau of Ocean Energy&nbsp;Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) and NOAA National Marine Fisheries&nbsp;Service (NOAA Fisheries Service).  The research program is called Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS).</p>
<p>The goal of AMAPPS is to coordinate the data collection and analysis efforts of the NOAA Fisheries Service Northeast and Southeast Fisheries Science Centers and the US Fish and Wildlife Service Division of Migratory Birds to accomplish six primary objectives:<br />1) Collect broad-scale data over multiple years on the seasonal distribution and abundance of marine mammals (cetaceans and pinnipeds), sea turtles, and sea birds using direct aerial and shipboard surveys of coastal US Atlantic Ocean waters;<br />2) Collect similar data at finer scales at several (~3) sites of particular interest to NOAA partners using visual and acoustic survey techniques;<br />3) Conduct telemetry studies of sea turtles, pinnipeds and seabirds to develop corrections for availability bias in the abundance estimate and to collect additional data on habitat use and life-history, residence time, and frequency of use;<br />4) Explore alternative platforms and technologies to improve population assessment studies;<br />5) Assess the population size of surveyed species at regional scales; and<br />6) Develop models and associated tools to translate these survey data into seasonal, spatially-explicit density estimates incorporating habitat characteristics.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Protected Species Branch (PSB) of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) for the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a requirement for data from satellite tags on 20 juvenile and adult loggerhead sea turtles in the southern U.S. Mid-Atlantic region, ideally off of Virginia and northern North Carolina.  Additionally, the requirement includes additional work to assess sea turtle availability bias by 1) conducting experimental detection trials, 2) comparing estimates of availability bias based on aerial survey data verses satellite tag data,  and 3) using simulations to evaluate various methods for combining sea turtle behavior and line transect data.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>As a part of the AMAPPS initiative, the NEFSC seeks to obtain information from 20 satellite tags on loggerhead sea turtles captured (via dipnet or other appropriate means) in nearshore or inshore Mid-Atlantic waters.  NEFSC wants to improve the estimation of availability bias for loggerhead sea turtles in Mid-Atlantic waters.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the personnel and materials necessary to perform the following services in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p>Supply data from satellite tags on 20 loggerhead sea turtles tagged in Mid-Atlantic waters off Maryland through northern North Carolina.</p>
<p>Capture, sample, handle, and tag twenty (20) loggerhead turtles in accordance with the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Task 1.  Contractor Vessel Requirements</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide  a seaworthy vessel for capturing and sampling loggerheads in offshore waters.  The vessel  shall be:</p>
<p>1.	Capable of staying offshore for ten (10) sampling days, <br />2.	Possess a small deployable inflatable boat for turtle capture, <br />3.	Provide a method to transfer the turtle onto the deck of the contractor vessel, <br />4.	Possess  a sighting platform that is raised higher than the main deck to ensure juvenile and adult loggerhead turtles can be sighted from a distance <br />5.	Possess a flat main deck that is large enough to complete the biological sampling. <br />6.	The vessel shall be available for a sufficient number of days to capture 15 loggerheads or a maximum requirement of 10 sampling days.</p>
<p>Task 2.  Contractor Sampling Gear Requirements</p>
<p>The contractor shall supply all necessary gear to sight, capture, tag, and sample 20 loggerhead sea turtles.  Satellite tagging protocols shall describe the protocols which will be used to provide a thorough cleaning of the carapace prior to tag attachment.  Satellite tags shall be attached to the loggerhead turtles using AnchorFix-1 epoxy.  Additionally, the contractor vessel shall have the following gear:</p>
<p>capture gear (dip net, etc), <br />binoculars, several small golf cart sized tires and other appropriate restraint devices, disposable gloves, <br />phlebotomy supplies for taking approximately 12 ccs from the turtle and separating it into 1 red topped vacutainer, 2 green topped vacutainers, 2 HVC tubes, 2 ISTAT cartridges, and 4 glass slides; <br />one standard and one microhematric centrifuge; <br />cooler for storage and shipping, <br />a refractometer for measuring total blood solids, <br />sharps container, <br />a thermometer for measuring cloacal temperature, <br />a stopwatch, <br />a Doppler device for monitoring heart beat, <br />flexible and rigid measuring devices for providing curved and straight measurements, <br />a scale suitable for medium and large loggerheads (roughly 50 cm CCL to 100 cm CCL), cleaning supplies which includes   Betadine, alcohol, and sterile cotton wipes) for preparing a sterile area, <br />flipper tags and applicator, <br />PIT tag scanner, applicator,/tags, biopsy punches and vials with DMSO, <br />instruments to scrape keratin and vials for storage and shipment, <br />vials to store and ship epibionts,  <br />thermometers for measuring air and water temperature, <br />camera for taking digital pictures, supplies to clean the carapace and apply the satellite tag  which shall include scrubbing pads, metal putty knives, rough and fine grit sandpaper, acetone, caulk gun, 2 tubes of AnchorFix-1 epoxy per turtle, rags, wooden tongue depressors, brightly colored electric tape, paper towels, rags and, and extra batteries for all electronic equipment.</p>
<p>Depending on the vessel, it may be necessary to provide a canopy or other shading device so that the sea turtle can be shielded from the sun or light rain while on board the vessel.   It is suggested that  a portable ISTAT and multiple hand-held VHF radios be supplied.  Ideally the contractor would have an existing ESA permit which covers the capture, sampling, handling, and tag application.</p>
<p>Task 3.  Contractor Vessel Capture, Sample, and Tagging Procedures</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this, the contractor shall supply a minimum of four (4) qualified contractor vessel crew personnel.  In past work when we captured turtles via dipnet, we needed AT LEAST four qualified personnel (but we always operated with more).  When in the presence of turtles, one  contractor vessel crew member shall operate the large vessel, one contractor vessel crew member shall stationed in a crow's nest and use binoculars to keep track of the location of a turtle and communicate its position to both vessel operators, one contractor vessel crew member  shall operate the small vessel, and one contractor vessel crew member  shall be stationed in the small vessel and operate the dip net. Both  contractor vessel crew personnel in the small vessel shall have substantial upper-body strength in order to move the large dip net through the water and to capture a large loggerhead turtles.  Captured loggerhead turtles may be heavy  at approximately 250 lbs.) and large at  approximate 100 cm curved carapace length.  The contractor shall provide details about how turtles will be boated and released safely in the scientific approach.  After the loggerhead turtle is captured, the contractor personnel  shall safely bring the turtle on board to harmlessly and efficiently handle, sample, and tag the loggerhead turtle.  When loggerhead turtles are on board, the contractor shall provide the personnel to have  one data recorder, one turtle handler, and one turtle sampler, and one turtle tagger working as a team.  If more than one turtle is brought on board the contractor vessel, the contractor shall increase the number of turtle handlers and samplers.  The contracted staff shall have passed an approved fishing vessel safety course, which includes having been trained by a USCG certified trainer.  NMFS may supply one person to assist with capture.</p>
<p>The contractor shall capture, sample, and tag 15 loggerhead sea turtles in nearshore Mid-Atlantic waters, within 2-20 miles offshore of Maryland through northern North Carolina.    The timeframe for proposed capture and sampling shall be justified.  An ideal time for the fieldwork (capture, sampling, tagging) may be in early in May as loggerheads begin to migrate into the area.  The size distribution of captured loggerheads shall be roughly proportional to the size distribution of loggerheads inhabiting the Mid-Atlantic nearshore waters.</p>
<p>The handling and sampling for the fifteen (15) near shore loggerheads shall include the following:  <br />Epibiota removal; <br />Count and survey; <br />Instrument and epoxy attachment  which includes the satellite tag); <br />Mark and flipper tags; <br />Mark and PIT tag; <br />Measurements; <br />Photograph and Video; <br />Blood sample and analysis for health assessment; <br />Blood samples and  preparation for subsequent stable isotope analysis; Fecal Sample; <br />Scute Scraping Sample (for subsequent stable isotope analysis); <br />Tissue Sample which shall include including skin for subsequent stable isotope and genetic analysis; <br />Handle, hold, and transport; <br />Weight; <br />Monitor and record heartbeat, <br />Cloacal temperature, <br />possible Cloacal lavage, <br />Lesion swab, <br />Clean pre-existing wounds.</p>
<p>Once the above duties are complied with, the contractor shall return the turtles safely to sea, and submit the biological samples to NEFSC for processing as directed by the COTR.</p>
<p>Task 4 Data Collection</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a complete dataset from  five (5) additional satellite tags deployed on loggerheads in inshore or nearshore Mid-Atlantic waters between Maryland and northern North Carolina.  The contractor shall provide the satellite tags and pay the ARGOS fees for these 5 turtles.  To fulfill this portion of the contract, the contractor may supply data from tags previously deployed since January 2010) or tags that will be deployed in the future, so long as they are deployed prior to October 1, 2012.  Tags deployed between March 2011 and April 2012 are preferred because this time period coincides with other NEFSC satellite tagging efforts)  It is ideal but not necessary for the contractors to supply sample these 5 turtles according to the same protocols used to sample the 15 nearshore turtles (as above).  The contractor-supplied satellite tag dataset must provide the average and standard deviation duration for surfacing events and for dive events.  Additionally the contractor satellite tag datasets must provide the average percent of time spent within the top meter and within the top two meters.  It is very strongly preferred that the tags provide all of the same information, in the same format, as is being provided by other tags funded by the NEFSC (&gt;50 tags, all of which are built by Sea Mammal Research Unit and parameterized similarly).  The parameterization of satellite tags used to support the 2011 loggerhead abundance estimate (NEFSC SEFSC 2011) can be found in the appendix of "2010 Annual Report to the Inter-Agency Agreement M10PG00075/0001: A Comprehensive Assessment of Marine Mammal, Marine Turtle, and Seabird Abundance and Spatial Distribution in US Waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean" by the NEFSC and SEFSC, available from NEFSC, Heather Haas, 166 Water Street, Woods Hole, MA 02543.</p>
<p>Task 4.  Samples and report</p>
<p>The contractor shall send samples, supply data, and write a draft and final report.</p>
<p>Contractors shall use a NMFS-supplied data sheet template for the non-telemetered data.  Completed datasheets should be transferred to electronic format and returned to NMFS in hardcopy (original or photocopy) format as well as in electronic spreadsheet format.  Flipper tag information should be reported directly to the Cooperative Marine Turtle Tagging Program (with CC to NEFSC).  All telemetered tag data will be uploaded into a NMFS Oracle database.  The contractor shall send biological samples (blood, skin, keratin, epibionts, etc.) to the appropriate contacts, as determined by NMFS.</p>
<p>3.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance (for the base) shall be 1 year from the date the contract is awarded.</p>
<p>4.  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS and DATA AGREEMENTS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a report on vessel suitability and readiness that consists of documentation of chartered vessel and suitability of vessel and crew to facilitate study objectives.</p>
<p>The Contractor must provide weekly reports to the COTR summarizing the research efforts during the time the fieldwork is being completed. Additionally, the contractor shall provide updates on the progress when requested. All data must be provided when requested and at the conclusion of the study.</p>
<p>The contractor shall produce a final report which includes the methods used for capture, handling, and sampling; the data collected; a discussion on any unusual or unexpected events, as well as a list of recommendations for improving similar projects in the future.  So long as the essential information (above) is included, the report may be brief and does not need to be in journal format.  Quantitative analysis is not being requested in the final report.  A draft of the final report shall be submitted to NEFSC within 45 days after the completion of fieldwork. The final report shall be submitted to NEFSC within 45 days after Contractor's receipt of the draft report back from NMFS/NEFSC. Both the final report and its draft shall be delivered in electronic format to the COTR at the Protected Species Branch, NEFSC, 166 Water Street, Woods Hole, MA 02543. All submitted products will be reviewed by the COTR for completeness within 45 days of receipt by NMFS/NEFSC.</p>
<p>All data released to NEFSC by the contractors in this base project will become the property of NEFSC, and NEFSC will have exclusive publication rights to this data for the first three years after the completion of this project.  NEFSC will invite the contractors to collaborate on the subsequent analysis and development of manuscripts (to be submitted to peer-reviewed journal).  The contractors are not obligated to collaborate on subsequent manuscripts, and it is not anticipated that there will be funds to support this portion of the collaboration.</p>
<p>II. OPTION ITEM REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>5.  OPTION ITEM</p>
<p>Optional Item Contract Line Item (CLIN) 0002</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Producing reliable abundance estimates is a key component of the protected species stock assessment plan (NMFS 2004).  In 2011 the SEFSC and NEFSC worked jointly under the Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS) to produce a preliminary abundance estimate of loggerhead turtles from Maine through Florida (NEFSC SEFSC 2011).  The estimation of the surface abundance was calculated using the computer program Distance (version 6.0, release 2, Thomas et al. 2009). The AMAPPS study is unique because of its broad scale and the explicit use of contemporaneous sea turtle surfacing patterns to model availability bias.  If sea turtles are not available to be seen by aerial survey observers because they sea turtles are diving deep below the surface, the abundance estimate will be negatively biased unless sea turtle behavior is incorporated into the analysis.  Availability bias  is a substantial source of bias (Marsh and Sinclair 1989); analytic methods for assessing availability bias should be developed and incorporated into the analysis of line transect data (Buckland et al 2004).</p>
<p>Although line transect methods are often applied to marine animals (Buckland et al 2004), application of these methods to sea turtles has been minimal in comparison to marine mammals.  There are several factors which make it difficult to model sea turtle availability bias and to combine sea turtle surfacing behavior with aerial survey data.  Sea turtle surfacing behavior is highly correlated to environmental conditions (perhaps more so than endothermic marine mammals) and differ by an order of magnitude in space or time (NEFSC SEFSC 2011); sea turtles are relatively small and do not have large (whale blow) cues to aid in detection; and sea turtles can have very long dives.  Typical methods (such as double platform) may be insufficient to estimate the abundance of long-diving animals because these animals can be completely missed while the observers pass (Okamura 2006).  In marine mammal simulations, when diving time was long, the magnitude of bias can be nearly 50% and the interval between the 5th and 95th percentiles did not include the true population size (Okamura 2011).  There are several methods (Laake et al 1997, Schweder et al 1999, Okamura et al 2011, Skaug et al. 2004; also see Buckland et al 2004) which could potentially be used or modified to model sea turtles well, but the appropriateness of these methods for sea turtle applications can only be accessed through simulation modeling.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>When discussing the shortcomings of the preliminary 2010 loggerhead abundance estimates, NEFSC and SEFSC (2011) recommended that more experiments be conducted to determine the approximate depth at which loggerheads are available to be detected by aerial observers.  In addition to depth, sea turtle availability to aerial observers may be related to other variables such as turbidity and their orientation in the water (angle of ascent/descent).  According to existing satellite tag data, loggerheads in the Mid-Atlantic are dry and at the surface ~ 10% of the time; &lt;1m deep ~33% of the time, and 1-2 m deep ~ 7% of the time.  We suspect that under certain conditions, turtles may be available to be seen within the first 0.5 m and under other conditions (offshore) turtles may be available to be seen within the first 2 meters.  Because so much time is spent near the surface, it is important to clarify what proportion of the near-surface animals are available to be detected.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The primary objective of  CLIN 0002, is to assess sea turtle availability bias by 1) conducting experimental detection trials, 2) comparing estimates of availability bias based on aerial survey data verses satellite tag data, 3) using simulations to evaluate various methods for combining sea turtle behavior and line transect data.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTES</p>
<p>Task 1: Experimental Detection Trials</p>
<p>The contractor shall deploy twenty (20) model turtles in turbid areas  which includes the Chesapeake Bay and in clearer areas  which includes the Mid-Atlantic offshore at various depths and various angles.  The contractor shall repeatedly fly over the models with a survey plane and conduct the detection trials in accordance with  AMAPPS observing protocols.  Turbidity levels shall be estimated from satellite-derived data and other reliable sources.  Based on the experimental results, the depth at which turtles were available to be seen shall be estimated.  The contractor shall focus on assessing availability bias, which occurs when turtles are not available to be seen.  Perception bias occurs when turtles are available to be seen but are missed by observers and perception bias is accounted for in AMAPPS analysis by using double platform survey methods.</p>
<p>Task 2: Estimate availability bias</p>
<p>The contractor shall estimate availability bias using two methods.    The contractor shall duplicate sea turtle aerial surveys in the Mid-Atlantic region  in conjunction with line transect methodology to estimate availability bias.  The contractor shall utilize existing aerial survey data or plans for surveys in 2012.  The contractor shall propose additional  surveys to achieve a sample size capable of robustly estimating availability bias.  The survey work shall ideally occur in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region.</p>
<p>The contractors shall estimate loggerhead availability using existing satellite tag data.  This component will use data from the 20 (15+5) satellite tag data from the base section of this SOW and compatible tags previously deployed by the NEFSC.  In addition to calculating a point estimate and variability of availability bias from the satellite tag data, the contractor shall address the shortcomings of NEFSC SEFSC 2011 by  analyzing the spatial, temporal, and individual variability in surfacing behavior.</p>
<p>Task 3: Evaluate methods for modeling availability bias</p>
<p>The contractor shall use simulation modeling to evaluate various methods for combining sea turtle behavior and lines transect data.    The contractor shall build a simulation model with a range of sea turtle surfacing patterns and use the model to test several methods for incorporating availability bias into line transect methods.  The results shall provide information on which methods are best suited to sea turtle applications.</p>
<p>5b. Optional Item CLIN 0003</p>
<p>Task 1:  Experimental detection trials</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct experimental detection trials and analyze data to determine the depth at which turtles were available to be seen and its relationship to turbidity levels.  The protocols used by the flight crew shall be similar to the AMAPPS protocols, including flight attitude..  The contractor shall supply an appropriate airplane  pilot,  two (2) to four (4) observers, and  one (1) to two (2) data recorders.  The contractors shall fabricate  twenty (20) variably-sized, 3-dimensional models of loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and green sea turtles.  The contractor shall create a subsurface anchoring system  to ensure turtle models can be reliably anchored at various depths.  Prior to the flight days, the contractor shall test the models to ensure the reliability of the anchoring system.  In order to deploy and retrieve the turtle models, the contractor shall supply a seaworthy and appropriate vessel].  The contractor shall provide all necessary safety equipment for all contracted personnel and one NOAA representative (should NOAA choose to send a representative).  Prior to analysis, the contractor shall enter all data into an electronic spreadsheet, and perform quality control checks on the data.</p>
<p>Task 2:  Estimate availability bias</p>
<p>The contractor shall estimate loggerhead availability bias from aerial survey versus the satellite tag data.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide data from duplicate sea turtle aerial surveys in the Mid-Atlantic regions to estimate sea turtle availability bias by using line-transect survey methodologies.   If additional flights are required to estimate the loggerhead availability bias, the contractor shall provide the necessary material and labor.  Additionally, the contractor d shall follow AMAPPS protocols (as described in NEFSC SEFSC 2011.  to the extent possible).</p>
<p>The contractor shall estimate loggerhead availability using existing satellite tag data. In addition to calculating a point estimate (and variability) of availability bias from the satellite tag data, the contractor shall address the shortcomings of NEFSC SEFSC 2011 by also analyzing the spatial, temporal, and individual variability in surfacing behavior.</p>
<p>Task 3:  Evaluate methods for modeling availability bias</p>
<p>The contractor shall use simulation modeling to evaluate methods for combining sea turtle behavior and line transect data.  In this component, the contractor shall build a simulation model with a range of sea turtle surfacing patterns and use the model to test at least 3 methods for incorporating availability bias into line transect methods.  The results shall provide information on which methods are best suited to sea turtle applications.</p>
<p>5c. Period of Performance (OPTION PERIOD)</p>
<p>The period of performance (for the option) shall be 2 years from the date the contract is awarded.</p>
<p>5d. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS and DATA AGREEMENTS (OPTION)</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a report on aircraft and vessel suitability and readiness that consists of documentation of chartered craft and suitability of craft and crew to facilitate study objectives. Report shall be delivered not later than 7 days prior to start of fieldwork.</p>
<p>The Contractor must provide weekly reports to the COTR summarizing the research efforts during the time the fieldwork is being completed. Additionally, the contractor shall provide updates on the progress when requested. All data must be provided when requested and at the conclusion of the study.</p>
<p>The contractor shall produce a final report which includes a detailed description of the methods (including a copy of all the statistical and simulation code), raw data (in electronic format), results, and list of recommendations for future research.  So long as the essential information (above) is included, the report may be brief and does not need to be in journal format.</p>
<p>A draft of the final report shall be submitted to NEFSC within 18 months after the completion of fieldwork. The final report shall be submitted to NEFSC within 45 days after Contractor's receipt of the draft report back from NMFS/NEFSC. Both the final report and its draft shall be delivered in electronic format to the COTR at the Protected Species Branch, NEFSC, 166 Water Street, Woods Hole, MA 02543. All submitted products will be reviewed by the COTR for completeness within 45 days of receipt by NMFS/NEFSC.</p>
<p>All data and results from this shall become the property of NEFSC, but publication rights will be jointly held by the contractors and NEFSC for the first three years after award of this contract.  The contractors are under no obligation to prepare manuscripts intended for submission to peer reviewed journals, and it is not anticipated that there will be funds to support this portion of the collaboration.  If the contractors choose not to participate in the development of manuscripts to submit to peer review journals, authorship standards (typical in the scientific community) should be followed.  This will&nbsp;likely result in the contractors being the lead authors and NEFSC being secondary coauthors.  If the contractors choose not to participate in the development of manuscripts to submit to peer review journals, the NEFSC will prepare the manuscripts and invite the contractors as coauthors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.  SPECIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (BASE and OPTION).</p>
<p>The COTR has determined that the final report to be delivered under this contract comes under Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-554), also known as the federal Information Quality Act of 2002.  Consequently, there are additional requirements for documenting methods and providing data.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the electronic copy of the final contract report from the COTR, the NEFSC Editorial Office will subject the report to the NEFSC's standard scientific and technical manuscript review procedures in order to assure the quality of the data and information in the report.  Based upon the NEFSC's review of the report, the NEFSC Editorial Office can request additional documentation from the contractor to assure the quality of the data and information in the report.  The contractor is obligated to provide any such requested additional documentation.  In particular, when preparing a final report on research activities and/or findings, an effort should be made by the contractor to fully document the methods (including any statistical analysis) and to fully cite the references associated with the research.</p>
<p>By acceptance of this award, the contractor or recipient of this contract agrees to convey to the Government and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide right to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and distribute copies of the full and final report to the public.</p>
<p>7.  QUALITY ASSURANCE/PROGRESS/COMPLIANCE</p>
<p>The COTR will be responsible for determining that the work is performed as required.  This is based on monitoring the progress of projects to which the contracted personnel are assigned.</p>

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.<br><br>PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as "Sensitive but Unclassified" or "For Official Use Only".<br><br>BACKGROUND:<br>The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.<br><br>INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:<br>1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.<br>     a.  System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.<br>     b.  Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.<br>     c.  Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.<br>     d.  High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).<br>     e.  High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.<br>     f.  All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.<br>     g.  Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.<br>     h.  Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.<br><br>2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.<br><br>3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.<br><br>4.  Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training.<br><br>5.  Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battlespace 2 (VBS 2) into the system.<br><br>HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY:<br>Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.<br><br>PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as "Sensitive but Unclassified" or "For Official Use Only".<br><br>BACKGROUND:<br>The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.<br><br>INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:<br>1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.<br>     a.  System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.<br>     b.  Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.<br>     c.  Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.<br>     d.  High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).<br>     e.  High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.<br>     f.  All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.<br>     g.  Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.<br>     h.  Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.<br><br>2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.<br><br>3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.<br><br>4.  Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training.<br><br>5.  Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battlespace 2 (VBS 2) into the system.<br><br>HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY:<br>Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

<p>The offerors must provide up to two (2) references for each project listed. For each reference, the contractor must include the reference's name, title, project, email address, and telephone number.

<p>In addition, the government may consider the offeror's past performance on any other relevant contract within the past five (5) years, of which the government has knowledge or becomes aware of as a result of references or other means.</p>
<p>This negotiated procurement will be accomplished by using FAR Part 15.3, Source Selection Procedures, which will result in the award of a firm-fixed price contract. Technical abilities shall be significantly more important than price. Offerors will be evaluated in the following order: (1) Environmental impact plan; (2) Experience and past performance of prime contractor and key subcontractors; (2) Experience, past performance and qualifications of key personnel; (3) Management/technical approach.</p>

<a href="mailto:martin.bushey@usace.army.mil">USACE HNC, Huntsville</a>
<DESC><br>Effective 21 February 2012 , The United States Army has released a Request For Proposal (RFP) and is now soliciting proposals for worldwide design-build and construction capabilities for Access Control Point (ACP) construction and equipment installation. The functions to be provided include a range of efforts to include entire ACP design and construction, ACP construction from completed designs, and specific ACP infrastructure or equipment upgrades. This contract is intended to provide a mechanism for Access Control Point repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, additions, construction, equipment procurement/installation, and maintenance services on installed equipment/systems at Government installations and facilities. ACP work includes, but is not limited to, roadway and traffic island construction; lighting and guard booth installation; canopy, passive barrier, gatehouse, search area and visitor control center construction; and active vehicle barrier, closed circuit television, and electronic security systems installation. The contractor may be required to survey the problem areas, evaluate and recommend solutions, develop and implement work plans in a timely manner within negotiated costs.<br><br>The Government seeks to award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order<br>Contracts (MATOC) for Design/Build Construction. The NAICS code is 237310: Highway, Street, and Bridge<br>Construction. The small business size standard is $33.5 Million. The total estimated shared contract capacity of all awarded contracts is $230 Million. The Government intends to award a target of five (5) contracts as a result of this solicitation and the estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twenty-four (24) months with 3 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each. Additionally, the Government may exercise an option under contract clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, for up to an additional six (6) months, for a total contract duration not to exceed of 66 months. The Government reserves the right to award more, less, or none at all. The minimum obligation will be $2,500.00 and this amount will be applicable to the base period only.<br><br>This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process. In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as "Offerors") may submit certain specific performance capability proposals,<br>demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction/construction only IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select a target of eight (8) Offerors to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process. The Government reserves the right to select more, less, or none at all. <br><br>In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, including the proposed task duration, a preliminary schedule, and a price proposal. The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award a base contract to the responsible Offerors, whose proposals conform to all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposals are determined to represent the overall best value to the government, considering design/technical approach; specialized experience; schedule/key personnel; price and price related information; and small business participation. The Government will award the initial task order to the Offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the best overall value to the Government, unless funds are not available to award. In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee to the Offeror selected for award of the task order. The Government will also award the minimum guarantee to other Offerors selected for award of MATOC base contracts but not selected for award of the initial task order.<br>
