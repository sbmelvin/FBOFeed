<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) / National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/Division of National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (DHANES) in Hyattsville, MD, intends to award a sole source firm fixed price Purchase Order to Beckman Coulter, Inc. of Brea, CA. The award will be for a base period and one option period, and the contractor will provide 24/7 maintenance services on three Coulter DxH 800 hematology instruments which perform Complete Blood Count measurements as part of data collection in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). NHANES utilizes three mobile examination centers (MECs) which travel to 15 different locations across the United States. High quality, 24/7 maintenance for the DxH 800 hematology machines is critical to the mission of NHANES because of the importance of consistent standards ensuring the validity of data over time, the time sensitive nature of the project, difficulties presented in rescheduling patients and the impossibility of retesting.
<p>In addition to providing 24/7 x 365 technical hotline support, a nationwide network of trained certified field service engineers and application specialists, comprehensive preventative maintenance visits in accordance with the manufacturing recommendations, factory qualified replacement parts and PROservice remote diagnostic capabilities, the contractor will designate a service representative to perform calibration and verification of the DxH 800 hematology machines when an MEC arrives at each site. Additionally, the designated service representative must be available to respond to requests for technical support in a timely manner should any malfunction occur at any time of day, night or weekend. Beckman Coulter is the only company that can meet NHANES' maintenance requirements with regard to the proprietary DxH 800 hematology equipment in use. Attempting to utilize another maintenance company would risk the success of the program and the integrity of the data collected.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Sciences Office at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of driven and nonequilibrium quantum systems.  The DRINQS program aims to demonstrate that the gains in coherence times that can be achieved in such systems can be exploited to improve the capabilities of quantum sensors and devices of importance to national security. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.

<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E126, Bethesda, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology &amp; Genetics (DCEG), Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program (EBP), Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB) plans to procure on a sole source basis follow-on services required to measure Longitudinal Analysis of Aflatoxin and Gallbladder Cancer from Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, 615 North Wolfe Street, Baltimore, MD 21205.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $15.0M.</p>
<p>Period of performance will be twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to measure AFB1-adduct levels in pre-diagnostic blood samples from GBC cases and non-cases in order to test the hypothesis that aflatoxin exposure is associated with GBC.</p>
<p>In 2012, gallbladder cancer (GBC) accounted for an estimated 178,000 new cancer patients and over 142,000 deaths globally. Geographically, GBC rates are strikingly variable, with the highest rates in south-central Chile and northern India. Although GBC is the most common biliary tract cancer, knowledge of GBC etiology remains limited. Gallstones are a major risk factor for GBC, but little is known about other risk factors that contribute to the development of GBC among gallstone patients.</p>
<p>Aflatoxin has been hypothesized to increase risk of GBC. Exposure to aflatoxin is associated with increased risk of liver cancer and has been shown to increase cellular proliferation in the biliary tract of monkeys and humans. The excretion of aflatoxin into bile can lead to high concentrations in the biliary tree, and aflatoxin exposure has been associated with gallbladder carcinogenesis in primates.</p>
<p>The NCI recently demonstrated a strong association between circulating aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-lysine adducts and GBC in humans with odds ratios (OR) of 13.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.3-47.9) for GBC versus population-based controls and 9.4 (95% CI: 2.8 to 37.2). The NCI then verified and extended this novel association using samples from the Shanghai Biliary Tract Cancer Study focusing on the comparison between GBC and gallstones to demonstrate the association of aflatoxin with GBC independent of gallstones. Among 250 GBC patients and 250 controls with gallstones, AFB1-lysine adduct detection was nearly 3-fold higher in GBC patients (OR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.87-4.54).</p>
<p>The NCI sees a consistent association between aflatoxin exposure and GBC in two independent populations. The NCI propose to evaluate the association prospectively using pre-diagnostic blood samples from two existing cohorts.</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;SYNOPSIS - OTPS CLS Services</p>
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a Sole Source basis with Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems of Orlando, FL for the procurement of Operational Test Program Set (OTPS) Contract Logistics Support (CLS) for the Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) and Transportable Consolidated Automated Support System (RTCASS) for a period of five years (1 year base plus 4 one year options). The Government is anticipating a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee contract. The requirement will consist of all services, materials, non-GFE equipment and use of facilities necessary to ensure system component availability and system performance of the following CASS Offload II OTPS': RADCOM E2C, CAT IIID E2C, RADCOM EA6B, CAT IIID EA6B, HTS EA6B/EA18G, DTB EA 6B, MH-60R OWEGO, NEWTS &amp; HTS F/18.</p>
<p>The required services are to meet Fleet demand by performing depot-level repair, replacement, overhaul and/or modification, maintain component reliability, improve parts availability/fill rate/logistics and requisition-response time, conduct obsolescence solutions based on the analysis, and monitor the equipment's configuration. Services for each OTPS shall include, but not be limited to all subcomponent, subassemblies and ancillary gear associated with each individual OTPS. Included in this support are obsolescence tracking and mitigation, as well as possible engineering investigation/logistics documentation update support.</p>
<p>Performance of all of the above efforts is contingent upon the Navy supplying copies of all the OTPS', CASS stations, and CASS Ancillary Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the contractor in order to perform this effort.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division (NSWC-PCD) intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to Reliable System Services Corporation (RSS), 746 North Drive, Melbourne, FL 32934 for systems engineering, integration and test support of the RT-1944A/U SeaLancet Tactical Network Radios&reg; . This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. RSS is the sole developer and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for these items. As such they are the only source with sufficient knowledge of the radio design and functionality to perform the requirement. After extensive testing and trade studies, these RSS radios were integrated into the MVCS Tactical Cabinets which created the baseline system. This system is already installed onboard LCS sea frames. Replacing these units with another product or manufacturer will not only duplicate the effort and delay the delivery of the tactical cabinets due to required testing and studies, integrating a new product could potentially invalidate the testing that MVCS has already completed on the legacy unit. The replacement may also introduce new problems and interface issues. The Government did not purchase or acquire the rights in data and design or a technical data package (TDP) for these RSS items because they are commercial items developed under SPAWARSYSCEN Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) topic N04-078, titled "Specification for the RT-1944U Communications System" dated 20 July 2004 (Contract N6553804M0128). Follow-on orders were not competed. RSS is the only source capable of meeting the requirement.<br />The Request for Quote (RFQ) number is N61331-18-Q-JK02. This purchase will be made under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government, per attached justification.

<CONTACT>Lisa A. Fisher, Phone 843-760-3356, Fax 843-760-3356, Email lisa.fisher@ati.org
<DESC><br />The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">pre-announcement</span> </strong>for a Request for Project Proposals (RPP) focused on<strong> Drug Treatment for Traumatic Brain Injury (DTTBI) - to rapidly advance the development of TBI drug candidate prototypes, through focused Phase 2 clinical trial testing, to produce a TBI drug that has been fully characterized and ready for Phase 3 trial. The end goal of DTTBI is a commercial TBI drug product that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat moderate - severe TBI.<br /></strong>&nbsp;
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MTEC:</span></strong><br />The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) by providing cutting-edge technologies and effective materiel life cycle management to transition medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations. MTEC is a biomedical technology consortium collaborating with multiple government agencies under a 10-year renewable Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), Agreement No. W81XWH-15-9-0001, with the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA). MTEC is currently recruiting a broad and diverse membership that includes representatives from large businesses, small businesses, "non-traditional" government contractors, academic research institutions and not-for-profit organizations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Background:</span></strong><br />Treating traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the top priorities for the Department of Defense (DoD). The DoD and the military services require solutions to fill the capability gap to treat TBI as close to point of injury as possible. The current standard of care for TBI remains supportive in nature, based on management of symptoms, with no drug therapies that address the brain damage. Despite numerous clinical trials on potential therapies, there is no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug therapy for the treatment of TBI. TBI has been shown to increase long-term mortality and reduce life expectancy. Estimated economic costs of care for TBI are &gt;$75B per year according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Therefore, it is important to develop a therapy that will decrease lost duty time and mitigate the life-long disability and rehabilitation costs associated with these post-injury conditions.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overall Program Objective:</span></strong><br />The overall objective of the Drug Treatment for TBI (DTTBI) program is to rapidly advance the development of TBI drug candidate prototypes, through focused Phase 2 clinical trial testing, to produce a TBI drug(s) that has been fully characterized and has the best chance for success in a Phase 3 trial.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) is seeking proposals for utilization of an already established and experienced TBI Clinical Consortium (TBI CC) that will enable the rapid development and clinical testing of TBI drug candidates currently in FDA-regulated clinical development. Through this RPP, the DoD will establish a contractual relationship with an existing TBI CC, and fund the evaluation of several drug candidates (potentially in collaboration with non-DoD sources of funding) in Phase 2 clinical trials.</p>
<p>Drug candidates for consideration must have already successfully completed Phase 1 clinical studies and will be jointly selected by the TBI CC management, associated subject matter experts, and the DoD Government Steering Committee. It is the DoD's expectation that the TBI CC shall design and execute focused Phase 2 clinical trials on multiple TBI drug candidate prototypes, to enhance the Phase 2 data set and reduce the overall risk of future investment into a Phase 3 clinical trial.</p>
<p>The deliverable at the end of the award's period of performance is to demonstrate efficacy in Phase 2 clinical trials with at least one TBI candidate drug and recommend its continued development toward FDA regulatory clearance. The overall end goal of the DTTBI program is a commercial drug product that is approved by the FDA to treat TBI.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Financial Framework: <br /></span></strong>The DTTBI MTEC award has a Milestone and Deliverable dependent incremental funding structure, with a total of approximately $25M over a five-year period of performance.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Administrative Information:</span></strong><br />The MTEC RPP for DTTBI is anticipated to be released no later than mid-February of 2018. Please note that MTEC membership is required for the submission of a full proposal in response to a future MTEC RPP for DTTBI. To join MTEC, please visit http://mtec-sc.org/how-to-join/</p>

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Technology Application Contracting Office (TAKO) intends to procure life cycle sustainment and engineering support services for the Voice and Data Recorder (VADR) using a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery -Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The anticipated contract will provide Operational Flight Program (OFP) software, hardware, integration, testing, to include the procurement of additional VADR units, as required. The proposed source is GE Aviation Systems LLC, 3290 Patterson Avenue, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 49512-1991. The associated NAICS code is 334511.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. GE owns the technical data rights for the VADR and they are unwilling to sell the technical data package at this time. To reverse engineer or wholly replace all of these units would result in substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delay.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capabilities statements or proposals received within the closing date set in this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All interested, capable, and responsible sources that would like to respond to this pre-solicitation synopsis are encouraged to provide a statement of interest along with supporting documentation to Contract Specialist, Latisha S. Blake, via email at latisha.s.blake.civ@mail.mil no later than 11:00 am EST on Wednesday, 21 February 2018.</p>

<DESC>PROCUREMENT TYPE: Sources Sought/ Market Survey for Sources to Provide Services<br /> NAICS CODE:<br /> 561, Administrative and Support Services, 561110, Office Administrative services
<p>Title: Proactive Obsolescence Management</p>
<p>Synopsis/Market Survey:</p>
<p>The Army Integrated Logistics Support Center (ILSC) is seeking to resolve material availability concerns for parts facing obsolescence, End-of-Life production, and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS). The lack of resolution in material availability creates extraneous cost burdens for CECOM and compounds scheduling delays and ultimately operational readiness. According to the Defense Standardization Program Office the cost of DMSMS resolution is at its lowest limit when approved parts are sourced as opposed to redesign. Material availability issues are inevitable in every weapons system and a proactive approach to DMSMS remediation improves cost, schedule, and performance for Program Managers and the Sustainment Center. The services will be procured via a three-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract and consist of the following items (national stock numbers (NSNs), part numbers (PNs). The primary place of performance for shall be Contractor location (offsite).</p>
<p><br /> This is a market survey to locate viable sources who can provide services related to those items:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide contractor personnel to the ILSC to support material availability and provide courses of action for Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS), End-of-Life, long lead time and obsolescence remediation. <br /> Below are some of the items (representative samples) that we would like the contractor to find:</p>

<DESC>The Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) program conducts research, development, testing, and evaluation to foster nationwide interoperability and advanced communications and operations technology for the nation's public safety community as part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) mission.  PSCR currently has an active research program studying various aspects of location-based services, including indoor mapping, localization, and navigation.  PSCR has sponsored both internal and external research in these areas.  In addition, NIST, with funding from PSCR, recently joined the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) at the Associate membership level to facilitate collaboration with its OGC network of over five-hundred companies, universities, and government agencies.<br /><br />OGC organizes annual testbed activities as part of their Innovation Program to provide a venue for creating and advancing solutions to complex geospatial challenges through open frameworks and standards.  Testbeds provide a unique platform where sponsors can outsource the rapid generation of prototypes and test environments with leading organizations in their field.  Testbeds result in more than just prototypes.  Depending on the level of success and need, new updated standards are often produced, in addition to guides, overviews, and best practices for solving leading edge geospatial problems.<br /><br />NIST is seeking qualified sources to be able to source and operate activities in OGC Testbed to address key problem statements related to indoor mapping and navigation for first responders.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;" lang="EN">See attached Statement of Work for more details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

<DESC><p>This is a Request for Information (RFI). <br /><br />This is a Sources Sought Technical Description to determine the availability and technical capability of small businesses to provide the required products/services. This is not a Request for Proposals. Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this Notice. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice or otherwise pay any person's costs incurred responding to this Notice.<br /><br />Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is conducting a sources sought action for the procurement of services in support of the Heavy Lift Helicopters Program Office. PMA-261, a program under the Program Executive Officer, Air ASW Assault and Special Missions Programs, supports multiple H-53 variants including the CH-53E, MH-53E and the CH-53K helicopters. The H-53 assault support missions include the lift and movement of cargo and troops/passengers; the tactical recovery of downed or damaged aircraft; and the lift of heavy, bulky equipment and supplies by external suspension. The In-Service (ISV) variants (CH-53E and MH-53E) have numerous modification programs. The aircraft inventories to be modified vary by Operational, Safety, and Improvement Program, depending upon kit modification production lead-time. The CH-53E has a seven blade main rotor and a four-blade canted tail rotor, and is powered by three T64-GE-416/416A/419 turbo shaft engines. The CH-53E is capable of both land and ship based transport of heavy equipment, supplies, and personnel. The MH-53E is similar to the CH-53E with additional capabilities for Airborne Mine Countermeasures, Vertical On-Board Delivery, and Special Missions that require a longer range and more precise navigation than the CH-53E. The overall goal of the modifications is: increased communication and navigation; integrated mechanical diagnostics and condition-based maintenance, propulsion and power; degraded visual environment mitigation; survivability and sustainment initiatives; and fleet operation and safety performance in the H-53E community. The CH-53K is an ACAT 1D program in Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) with Full Rate Production planned for Fiscal Year 2019. PMA-261 programs range from the System Development and Demonstration phase to the Operations and Support phase.<br /><br />There are multiple Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) and functional areas that are supported by this effort.

The CPS database information is shared with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies.

(b) Each Contractor whose contract award is estimated to exceed $100,000 is required to register with the NIH CPS database at the following web address: https://cpscontractor.nih.gov. Help in registering can be obtained by contacting CPS Support E-mail (cps-support-l@list.nih.gov) or by calling (301) 451-2771. Registration should occur no later than thirty days after contract award, and must be kept current should there be any change to the Contractor s registered representative.

(c) For contracts with a period of one year or less, the Contracting Officer will perform a single evaluation when the contract is complete. For contracts exceeding one year, the Contracting Officer will evaluate the Contractor s performance annually. Interim reports will be filed each year until the last year of the contract, when the final report will be completed. The report shall be assigned in CPS to the Contractor s designated representative for comment. The contractor representative will have thirty (30) days to submit any comments and re-assign the report to the VA Contracting Officer.

(d) Failure to have a current registration with the NIH CPS database, or to re-assign the report to the VA Contracting Officer within those (30) days, will result in the Government s evaluation being placed on file in the database with a statement that the Contractor failed to respond.

CONTRACTOR SECURITY INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS:




CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:

All Contractor Nursing and Nursing Support Services personnel who require access to the Department of Veterans Affairs  computer systems shall be the subject of a background investigation. This requirement is applicable to all subcontractor personnel requiring the same access. The Department of Veterans Affairs Memorandum dated February 8th, 2008 (10N1-23) provides additional guidance and clarification specific to Contractors  investigations. In all cases, access (physical and computer) cannot be granted until officially notified by Security Investigations Center (SIC), Little Rock Arkansas. Access can be granted prior to receiving final adjudication results. 

 1)   Position Sensitivity   The position sensitivity for each Contractor position is determined by the VA utilizing PDT (Position Designation System Automated Tool) at www.opm.gov/investigate/resources/position/index.aspx. Each position will be designated at the high, moderate, or low risk level, depending on the position s potential for adverse impact to the integrity and efficiency of the services (CFR 731.106). Multiple positions may be documented on a single form. Risk levels determine what level of investigation is required.

NOTE: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) PIV Program Office will be implementing the 2009 rollout of the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) program across the enterprise to more than 200 VA sites. This new policy will most likely require all Contractors to be fingerprinted at a minimum, regardless of their position at the VA.

 2) Background Investigation - The level of background investigation commensurate with the required level of access may be either a Special Agreement Check (SAC), is National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) (low risk), Moderate Background Investigation (MBI) (moderate risk), or Background Investigation (high risk). Non-citizen contract personnel appointed to low risk positions will be subject to a National Agency Check with Law Enforcement and Credit Check (NACLC).

Contractor Responsibilities:

  (a)  The Contractor shall bear the expense of obtaining background investigation(s), regardless of the final adjudication determination. A Bill of Collections shall be generated by the VA after final adjudication determination has been received. Final adjudication results may take up to six months but are normally received within 90 days after submission.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<p>The Open Period for JANUARY is JANUARY 1, 2018 to JANUARY 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG02 and must be located within Region 2.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<DESC><br />FY18 St. Louis River Slip 3 and Slip C Remedial Cap
<p><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Detroit District is seeking contractors for the FY18 St. Louis River Slip 3 and Slip C Remedial Cap, Duluth, MN project.</p>
<p>The scope of work requires the contractor to provide all work, materials, equipment, labor, supervision, management, and administration to construct a remedial cap in two slips in the Duluth-Superior harbor. Both of these slips have areas with sediment concentrations for contaminants of concern above the respective clean up levels. <br /><br />Slip 3 construction involves a limited amount of sediment leveling to reduce grade changes as well as dredging a 900 square foot area outside of the capping footprint and placing material in the deep portions of the capping area. Leveling activities will be followed by construction of a subaqueous cap over approximately 0.88 acres in the slip.<br /><br />Slip C construction involves construction of a subaqueous cap over approximately 6 acres of the slip where sediment concentrations for contaminants of concern are above the respective clean up levels.<br /><br />Both subaqueous caps will be comprised of two layers. Layer A will consist of dredged material from the federal navigation channel. Layer B will consist of 6-inch thickness of imported aggregate. <br /><br />All work must be completed from the water, including transporting material. If the contractor would like to access the slip by land they will be responsible for gaining their own access agreements.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of construction is between $1 Million and $5 Million.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, Dredging and Surface Cleanup Activities, which has a size standard of $27.5 Million in average annual receipts.</p>
<p>This is NOT an Invitation for Bid. This announcement is for planning purposes only. Qualified companies are encouraged to respond. The response to this notice shall be in summary format and shall not exceed six (6) pages, including the attached response form. In order to determine the extent of industry interest and experience in the project, interested contractors shall present the following information:</p>
<p>1. A completed Sources Sought Information Request Form located in this "Sources Sought" notice on www.FBO.gov.</p>
<p>2. If applicable, identification and verification of the company as a Small Business, HubZone, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business, and/or Woman Owned Small Business, subject to verification by the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p>3. A letter from the firm's bonding company verifying that the firm can be bonded up to the amount of this project (construction bonding level per contract and aggregate construction bonding level, both expressed in dollars).</p>
<p>4. Past Experience - provide descriptions of two projects substantially complete or completed within the last ten years which are similar to this project in size, scope, and dollar value.<br />Qualified companies, regardless of their size or socio-economic status, are encouraged to respond. No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this sources sought or Government use of any information provided. The Government will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments.</p>
<p>All companies that are interested in responding are invited to submit their information via email only to the Contracting Branch at LRE-Quotes@usace.army.mil<br />and Carlette.L.Williams@usace.army.mil.</p>
<p>Responses must be provided in either Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat PDF format. Please submit responses no later than the time stated in this notice on www.fbo.gov.

<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>AN/FSQ-209(V)1, commonly referred to as the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Intelligence Processing Center Version 1 (IPC-v1), is the battlefield intelligence system that hosts DCGS-A software at US Army Fixed Site facilities. It provides fully integrated and timely intelligence on the battlefield. The DCGS-A IPC-v1 is the core framework for a worldwide distributed, network centric, system-of-systems architecture that conducts collaborative intelligence operations and production. The system is housed in the DCGS-A Fixed Site facilities and consists of privately hosted servers and storage arrays.</p>
<p>This RFI is focused on identifying commercial items to upgrade/replace the DCGS-A IPC-v1 enterprise data warehouse component, also known as the "Brain", as well as introduce several additional analytics and system management functions. Specifically, Capability Drop (CD) 2 focuses on the modernization and enhancement of the DCGS-A data warehousing capabilities resident at Military Intelligence (MI) Operations Battalions supporting Army Service Component Commands (ASCCs) by providing a scalable solution that provides an adaptable Data Management Architecture (DMA), automated analytics, and common core services.</p>
<p>Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Capability Manager - Foundation (TCM-F) has developed, in conjunction with the Intelligence Center of Excellence (ICoE), a draft Capability Drop requirements document outlining the operationally relevant requirements for DCGS-A's enterprise data warehouse and analytics capability.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI may be used by the Government to determine invitees for a market research product demonstration based on criteria such as: number and quality of the responses, magnitude of CD-2 requirements a solution can currently meet, additional capabilities of interest to the Government, overall technical risk, and availability of resources.

<DESC>This solicitation is being advertised as a noncompetitive sole source solicitation as provided under FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), Lower Colorado Regional Office (LCRO) has a requirement for under water sonic telemetry equipment.  The proposed vendor is Sonotronics Inc. Sonotronics equipment is currently in use by other government researchers in the region, and this allows for seamless sharing of information, equipment, and collaboration which is an added benefit to the government and region. Other manufacturer's products are not compatible with what is already in use and it is not economically feasible to replace the current equipment since the transmitters currently in use are surgically implanted in fish and cannot be replaced.

The NAICS for this action is 334513, Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables, which has a small business size standard of 750 employees.

Award is anticipated in February 2018 and the resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price purchase order.  

All responsible sources may submit a quotation, capability statement, or proposal, by Friday, February 2, 2018, which shall be considered by the agency.

Questions and other documents may be submitted to Austin Sachs via e-mail at ksachs@usbr.gov or via facsimile at (702)293-8332.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to award a sole source requirement to Adair Ranges, Inc. (345 W. 32nd Street  Yuma, AZ 85364-8107) for firing range facility usage.  The Customs and Border Protection, Office of Field Operations (OFO), San Luis, Arizona Port of Entry (POE) has a requirement to secure firing range services for the full training and qualification needs of mission personnel.  Given the unique requirements of the range to be provided, and the lack of existing facilities that can meet - or be upgraded to meet - the necessary capabilities required for this service, this action is limited to a single available contract provider.  Further reasons detailing why this requirement has been determined to be reasonably available from only one source are included in the attached justification and approval.
<p><br />This proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i).  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by <strong>Friday, February 9, 2018 at 8:00am Arizona time</strong>.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any vendors who believe they can provide the range services required and can provide proof of ability to meet the requirements should email their company's capabilities information to the attention of Contract Specialist Benjamin Dorgan by <strong>Friday, February 9, 2018 at 8:00am Arizona time</strong>.  Only email submissions sent to the following address will be accepted: benjamin.j.dorgan@cbp.dhs.gov.  Information submitted should fully support the company's capability to provide the required firing range services to meet the requirements of the OFO San Luis POE.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) </strong></p>
<p><strong>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Uniform Contract1.0 Description</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><strong>1.1 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through Customs and Border Protection (CBP), is in the process of re-competing the requirement for the DHS National Uniform Strategic Sourcing Contract for agencies under its aegis. DHS is interested in incorporating commercial and industry logistics practices that support this type of procurement in order to ensure quality uniforms are delivered to uniformed employees in a timely manner. To accomplish this, DHS intends to make industry a partner in all facets of the acquisition process, specifically by considering existing market capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses for the acquisition of this indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) will allow DHS to incorporate industry input into the initial stages of the procurement. The proposed contract will be for a period of 7 years in support of the DHS National Uniform and Quartermaster Support Services Program. The following is basic information on the Government's contract vehicle format and service needs:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>-Contract Vehicle: IDIQ; Firm-Fixed Price Line-Item Basis, Mandatory Buy (with exceptions) for all components of DHS (Customs and Border Protection, United States Coast Guard (USCG), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), United States Secret Service (USSS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD)) as well as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>-Provide quality uniform items for approximately 135,000 employees both in the United States and overseas</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>-Manage a customer website for making uniform selections, managing employee allowance accounts and tracking reporting data</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>-Provide Quartermaster services as appropriate to specific components</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>-Additionally, the following are needed capabilities for any Uniform contract:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>-Quality uniforms made to specifications with minimal defect rates</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>-Timely delivery to uniformed employees with little wait time between order and receipt</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>-Innovative uniform technologies to support DHS's diverse mission needs in various environments and climates</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>-Must be capable of sourcing a large number of COTS items</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>-Security of uniform items and DHS branded items</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>-Compliance with applicable laws such as Kissell Amendment</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>-Long return window, without charge to employees</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>-Emergency uniforms available when needed</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1.2 If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized (advertised) on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website: https://www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.2.0 Background and Requirements</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><strong>The current DHS contract began in September 2014 and continues through September 2019. DHS is seeking feedback with regards to requirements and the RFP package in order to identify potential areas which could be modified to allow for more open competition without sacrificing uniformed employees' needs. By building industry partnerships early on in the acquisition process, DHS hopes to improve the contract vehicle in the long run.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.1 Delivery Date: Contract start is expected to begin by September 2019 and continue for a seven year period. The proposed contract will likely include a base period of 5 years with two one-year options.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.2 Delivery Period and Condition: Full delivery and uniform ordering website opening is expected approximately two weeks after Fiscal Year funding is received, which has historically been between November and January. (Note: Other components may only require a "read only" webpage for their line items. This allows for ease of ordering by those components.) Several contract deliverables may be due prior to the start of uniform deliveries such as First Article prototypes.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.3 Limitations: Uniform/textile suppliers must meet applicable laws including but not limited to the Kissell Amendment and any future law or Trade Agreement changes or additions affecting DHS uniform policies.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.4 Security Requirements: DHS branded items are considered a security concern and must be accountable and secured at all times.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.5 Uniform Fulfillment Requirements: DHS will require that 90% of Allowance Account orders (for any component) must be shipped within 14 calendar days (this includes items that require customization like name tapes, patches, and other branding).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.6 Backorder Requirements: Orders for items placed on backorder (those items not shipped within 14 days) must be shipped within 60 days.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.7 Disincentives: The Government is considering methods to incentivize performance. If the vendor is unable to meet the key performance indexes (like those mentioned in 2.5 and 2.6), the vendor shall credit the Government 1% of total monthly invoice value for that period for each Key Performance Index which fails to meet the requirements.<br /><br />3.0 Requested Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>The requested information is sought to support the government cost estimate (GCE) and implementation timelines; and identify available uniform providers and innovative logistics solutions in order to expand competition opportunities.<br /><br />4.0 Responses</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. Plan to identify and incorporate new and emerging technologies into uniform and textile design and improve quality standards,</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8. Data and account management plan and best practices employed; including a plan for sharing and exchanging data near real time (NRT) with Government and Government systems.</strong></p>

The intent is to allow potential offerors the opportunity to provide insight into factors that may impact the acquisition of Uniform items so that the Government can make educated cost/benefit decisions to open competition.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding to the Government. The Government has not made a commitment to procure any of the RFI requirements discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought.

<SOLNBR>140F0318Q0016
<CONTACT>Bashizi, Chantal
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 3, Bloomington, MN intends to award a sole source firm fixed price order under authority of FAR 6.302-1, Other than Full and Open Competition procedures, and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition procedures to Iowa Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Des Moines, Iowa. This requirement is for managing chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal disease of white-tailed deer that was recently been detected in Iowa's wild deer herd. Specific actions include: population estimation of deer in areas where CWD has been detected; tissue sampling from harvested deer so CWD testing can be conducted; the establishment of special hunt zones and issuing of extra deer harvest licenses; and conducting outreach/educational meetings for landowners, hunters, and distributing educational materials to the public. The areas of Iowa affected by the recent detection of CWD, and where these actions will take place, are in close association with lands owned and managed by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Driftless Region National Wildlife Refuge (refuge), and will reduce the likelihood that CWD infects wild deer found on the refuge.  The proposed work will complement work already being conducted by the Iowa DNR. 

The Iowa DNR has management authority for wild white-tailed deer within the state of Iowa and has the lead role in monitoring deer populations and disease prevalence within those populations by establishing and enforcing deer harvest regulations, conducting outreach and education with the public regarding deer management. Because of this jurisdictional framework, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and a limited number of other government agencies and tribes, have a limited role in assisting and complementing the efforts of the Iowa DNR in these activities.

 There are no other entities (government agencies, tribes, non-governmental organizations, private businesses) capable of conducting all of the activities described here that are currently being done by the Iowa DNR at the scale of interest (northeast Iowa). Additionally, no other entities have the legal rights or responsibilities for conducting many of the activities described here (deer harvest management). The limited number of activities that could be done by other entities (e.g., deer population estimation; tissue sampling from harvested deer for disease monitoring) would be prohibitively expensive because it would represent additional costs to do work that is already being done by the Iowa DNR.
These activities have followed a decision based framework and reaching a critical phase where continued work with Iowa Department of Natural Resources will ensure the activities are carried on smoothly at the scale of interest due to jurisdiction issues.  The North American Industry classification (NAICS) code is 924120. 
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, firms with expressed interest and capability are encouraged to respond.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA)<br />GEORGE C. MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER (MSFC) <br />OCCUPATIONAL MEDICAL SERVICES</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</p>
<p><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to request 1) feasibility input on the Government's approach to a revised requirement 2) to determine if there are two or more capable small businesses that can perform the revised requirement for the follow-on contract to the current Environmental Engineering and Occupational Health Services Contract. It is incumbent on you to use your best judgment in responding to this Notice. The Capability Statements received in response to this notice may lead to a Small Business set-aside if two (2) or more Small Businesses can be determined by the Government to be capable of performing the tasking as described in this RFI's known and potential requirements and in the Draft Performance Work Statement (Attachment 01). Please note that all interested parties, large and small businesses, are encouraged to respond.</p>
<p>A. Background</p>
<p>The predecessor contract is NNM13AA80C with HPM Corporation. The PWS is comprised of Program Management, Environmental Compliance, Occupational Health and Industrial Hygiene. The contract is performed on-site at the Medical Center, MSFC Bldg. 4249. The contract has a five-year period of performance and expires October 31, 2018. It is a firm fixed price mission services contract with an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) component. The current value of the contract mission is approximately $4.3M per year. Budgeted amounts are comprised of: Environmental Compliance on-site Support ($.95M/year), Occupational Health (Industrial Hygiene, Health Physics, and Respiratory Protection) ($1.25M/year), and Medical Center ($2.1M/year). Information relating to the current EEOH contract may be requested via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) from: https://www.nasa.gov/FOIA/index.html.</p>
<p>In support of shaping a new approach to the follow on contract, MSFC released RFI number NNM17ZPS003L posted June 28, 2017. This RFI requested feasibility input on three possible cost saving options for performance of program management, occupational medicine, preventive medicine, acute medical care, and emergency medical response services at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and requested suggestions for same. Subsequently, the Government modified cost savings Option a. "to provide at no cost, or reduced cost to the Government, the medical surveillance exams and work related acute care visits for civil servants and Contractor personnel in exchange for charging fee-for-services for preventive health exams and non-occupational acute care visits to the MSFC community, and the Redstone Arsenal Community." This revision now included the Redstone Arsenal Community as a potential population for health services.</p>
<p>Respondents were invited to provide a listing of the types, and respective amounts of information industry may need to develop a business case to support the revision to "Option a." The information requested is at Attachment 02.</p>
<p><br />B. RFI Notice Objective</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to request 1) feasibility input on the Government's approach to a revised requirement 2) to determine if there are two or more capable small businesses that can perform the revised requirement for the follow-on contract to the current Environmental Engineering and Occupational Health Services Contract.</p>
<p>C. Description of Known and Potential Requirements</p>
<p>The basic requirement is for purchase of commercial medical services in support of the MSFC Occupational Health Program on-site at the Medical Center Building 4249. The requirement includes performance of all OSHA and NASA-specific physicals and initial treatment for all work related injuries for all covered personnel. In addition, it includes all Industrial Hygiene program requirements (see covered personnel in PWS at Attachment 01).</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to phase-out the initial requirement to perform approximately 900 on-site Contractor OSHA and NASA-specific physicals from the basic requirement during years 2-5 of the contract. This phase-out will create excess capacity within the medical center. As a cost savings initiative, the Contractor will leverage the excess capacity (equipment) under the Use and Charges clause in their contract, FAR 52.245-9 to provide on-site Contractor OSHA and NASA specific physicals, in exchange for an equipment rental fee to the Government. The Contractor will negotiate separately with on-site Contractors for performing the OSHA and NASA-specific physicals as they are phased out of the contract.</p>
<p>Unlike the current contract, the basic requirement does not include performance of any voluntary civil servant physicals or acute care. However, MSFC is required under NPR 1800.1 to offer voluntary physical examinations to civil servants. Therefore, under Use and Charges the Contractor will offer the excess capacity at the Medical Center to conduct voluntary physicals for civil servants. Because civil servant physicals are already covered by health benefits, the Contractor will accept responsibility for billing fee for services which includes private medical insurance for any voluntary civil servant physicals conducted under Use and Charges.</p>
<p>Excess capacity for conducting medical services may also be offered to the Redstone Community at large. For any commercial service undertaken under the Use and Charges clause, the Contractor is responsible for collecting payment.</p>
<p>The medical services Contractor will undertake the responsibility for advertising uses for the excess capacity at the medical center to include the capacity to conduct OSHA and NASA- specific physicals, voluntary physicals, and acute care. MSFC will allow the Contractor's use of store stock for advertising pamphlets and brochures, and MSFC will advertise clinic capabilities using center electronic social media sites and to the Redstone Community Health Promotions Council (CHPC).</p>
<p>The medical services Contractor will undertake the responsibility to secure HIPPA data (if housed at the Medical Center) that results from the use of excess capacity at the Medical Center under the Use and Charges Clause (e.g. for the Contractor OSHA and NASA-specific physicals, for voluntary physicals, and for acute care) to include maintaining a secure server to store HIPPA data and a secure internet connection to transmit and receive HIPPA data.</p>
<p>Unlike the current contract, the basic requirement does not include performance of any Environmental Compliance functions.</p>
<p>D. Input Requested</p>
<p>As a result of the preceding, the Government requests either an expression of interest in the form of capability statements, or an expression of disinterest in the form of feasibility inputs (see Table F-1 at Attachment 03) addressing the following approach:</p>
<p>A Firm Fixed Price Contract with and Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity component for:<br />i. Occupational Medical Services, for approximately 350 civil servants and 900 MSFC on-site Contractors (with the number of on-site Contractor OSHA and NASA-specific physicals to be phased out from 900 to 0 during years 2-5 of performance, according to a TBD schedule in the contract) and work-related injury visits for civil servants and Contractors.<br />ii. Industrial Hygiene, Health Physics, Respiratory Protection<br />iii. Program Management</p>
<p>With the Opportunity for:<br />i. Leveraging excess capacity under Use and Charges clause FAR 52.245-9 for providing commercial services for OSHA and NASA-specific physicals to on-site Contractors (under separate billing arrangements with contractors).<br />ii. Leveraging excess capacity under Use and Charges clause FAR 52.245-9 for providing commercial services for on-site voluntary health maintenance exams for civil servants (billing "fee for services" to include private medical insurance as payment).<br />iii. Leveraging excess capacity under Use and Charges clause FAR 52.245-9 for providing commercial services for on-site voluntary health maintenance exams, and non-occupational acute care visits to civil servants, on-site Contractors, and the Redstone community (billing "fee for services" to include private medical insurance as payment).</p>
<p><br />E. The Capability Statement shall succinctly address the following three items to demonstrate the Contractor's capability to perform the requirements of the Performance Work Statement at Attachment 01 and in this RFI.</p>
<p>1. Demonstrate your ability to manage as prime Contractor, the type and magnitude of the PWS. Cross reference to specific past performance examples.</p>
<p>2. Demonstrate your technical ability, or potential approach to achieving technical ability, to perform the requirements of the PWS with at least 50% of the cost of the contract for personnel, with your own employees. Include your ability or potential IT approach to segregating and safeguarding HIPPA data collection, storage, and transmission. Include your ability or potential approach, to segregating cost for commercial activity under Use and Charges, and cost for effort under the contract PWS. Cross reference to either specific past performance examples, or specific evidence of how you will achieve technical ability by the 1st day of performance.</p>
<p>3. Demonstrate your capacity, or potential approach to achieving capacity, to conduct the requirements of the PWS. (Capacity refers to matters such as magnitude of the tasking, the amount of equipment, supplies, or facilities involved, and the size of the staff needed). Cross reference to specific past performance examples, or specific evidence of how you will achieve required capacity by the 1st day of performance.</p>
<p>F. Also provide the following:<br />a. Company name, <br />b. Website Address<br />c. POC information<br />d. DUNS<br />e. Business Size for the corresponding NAICS code (s) Facilities Support Services -561210, Other Scientific and Consulting Services -54169, All Other Miscellaneous Ambulatory Health Care Services-62199</p>

<p>ADDENDA TO FAR 52.212-2:</p>
<p>a. FAR 52.212-2(c) is not applicable to this solicitation.</p>
<p>b. BASIS FOR OFFER. This is a competitive acquisition in accordance with FAR parts 12 and 13. The Government will submit an offer in the form of a purchase order to the quoter that represents the best value to the Government. Quotes will be evaluated as described below.</p>
<p>(1) Solicitation Requirements. All quotes submitted will be reviewed for completeness to determine if they contain all information requested in the addenda to FAR 52.212-1. Quotes that are incomplete or missing information may be considered non-responsive and excluded from the evaluation.</p>
<p>(2) Price Evaluation. The total evaluated price will be determined by adding together the extended amounts quoted for each line item. The extended amounts will be confirmed by multiplying each line item quantity by the quoted unit price. If there is a conflict between the quoted unit prices and extended amounts, the unit price shall be used to determine the total evaluated price. Any discounts identified in the quote will be included in the evaluation of the total evaluated price. No advantage will accrue to a vendor who submits a quote for an unreasonably low price. The lowest price quote may not necessarily be selected. Failure to propose for any line item may cause the vendor's quote may be considered non-responsive and excluded from the evaluation. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness of the quoted price.</p>

A quoter will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably if they do not have a record of past performance in PPIRS-SR under the PSC of the items being purchased.</p>

(t) System for Award Management (SAM). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, â€œdoing business asâ€ name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of Paymentâ€ paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the â€œSuspension of paymentâ€ paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the
Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>Requirement<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), requires Bordetella-Free Weanling Baboons.</p>
<p>Background/Statement of Need<br />Pertussis is an acute, highly contagious, potentially life threatening respiratory disease, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The underlying factors leading to the failure of public health measures to control pertussis disease using currently licensed vaccines are poorly understood. A more complete understanding of this disease and of the mechanisms of vaccine-mediated protection is a critical public health need.  Currently, the baboon model of pertussis, developed in the laboratories of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), is the only animal model of pertussis that recapitulates the disease as observed in human patients. The use of this animal model to study the relative effectiveness of vaccination with experimental pertussis vaccines and the testing of candidate therapeutics requires the delivery of weanling baboons to the CBER primate facility.</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements:<br /> - Bordetella-Free Weanling Baboons <br /> - Vaccinated with FDA provided vaccines (within 1-weeks prior to each vaccination cycle) at 2, 4, and 6 months of age before delivery to CBER<br /> - The contractor shall draw blood and perform nasopharyngeal washes upon enrollment into the study and prior to each vaccination. The nasopharyngeal washes and sera shall be sent to CBER laboratories.<br /> - The contractor shall provide age-matched baboons in three deliveries (between 6-8 months of age at time of delivery)<br /> - All baboons shall be examined by a licensed veterinarian, Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) as defined by the Animal Welfare Act Regulations (9 CFR, Subchapter A, Part 1 - Definition of Terms), experienced in Non-Human Primates (NHP) medicine and surgery, and found to be in good health prior to shipping accompanied by a certificate of health for each baboon<br /> - Baboons shall be shipped by USDA-licensed carriers and the Contractor shall be responsible for meeting all requirements associated with shipment and delivery of animals<br /> - Shippers shall comply with Animal Welfare Act Regulations regarding the transportation standards for NHP, Title 9, Subchapter A - Part 3 -- Transportation Standards.<br /> - Contractor shall maintain liaison with carrier personnel in order to assure the animals receive proper care in accordance with USDA standards and guidelines during transit</p>
<p>Animal Welfare, Delivery and Acceptance Criteria:<br />Animals shall be of the age, gender and weight as specified above<br />Animal shall be free of exposure to Bordetella<br />Animals shall arrive in good health<br />Acceptance of animals shall be made by the supervising veterinarian at the quarantine facility upon completion of a quarantine entry physical</p>

<p>Contractor Performance Evaluation (s)<br />In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 42.15, FDA will complete annual and final contractor performance evaluations.  Annual evaluations will be prepared to coincide with the anniversary date of the contract.  Additional interim performance evaluations may be prepared at the CO's discretion, as necessary. Final performance evaluations will be completed upon contract expiration.</p>
<p>FDA will utilize the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) in order to execute annual and final contractor performance evaluations. CPARS is a secure Internet website located at https://www.cpars.gov/main/cparsmain.htm. FDA will register the contractor in CPARS upon receipt of the name and email address of two (2) individuals who will be responsible for serving as the Contractor's primary and alternate CPARS contacts.  Once FDA registers the contractor in CPARS, the Contractor will receive an automated CPARS email message which contains User IDs and instructions for creating a password.</p>
<p>Once a performance evaluation is issued, the Contractor's primary and alternate CPARS contact will receive an email instructing them to logon to CPARS in order to review the performance evaluation.  The Contractor has 14 calendar days from the date of performance evaluation issuance in which to review the evaluation.  If the Contractor is in agreement with the performance evaluation outcome, the evaluation becomes final.  Should the Contractor be in disagreement with the performance evaluation outcome, rebuttal comments must be submitted via the CPARS within 30 days from date the evaluation was issued by FDA.  Any disagreement between the CO and the Contractor will be referred to a contracting official one level above the CO, whose decision will be final.</p>
<p>Copies of each performance evaluation and contractor responses, if any, will be retained as part of the official contract file and will be used to support future award decisions. Evaluations will also be stored for a 3 year period (6 years for construction) in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov.</p>
<p>Contractors may obtain CPARS training material and register for on-line training at https://www.cpars.gov/main/cparsmain.htm. There is no fee for registration or use of the CPARS system.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>
