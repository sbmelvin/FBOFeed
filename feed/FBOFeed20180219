<p>The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is seeking the following information:   Potential Respondents shall describe how they would propose to successfully provide these services, assuming that all services provided by Respondent would be accomplished in accordance with all applicable U.S. laws, regulations, policies, and procedures.</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI). In preparation for an upcoming anticipated procurement, the NESDIS Field Delegate is conducting market research to identify potential sources and determine the optimal procurement strategy for acquiring the Services.<br /><br />The Office of Satellite and Product Operations (OSPO) is part of the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS).  NESDIS is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Department of Commerce.  The U.S. National Ice Center (NIC) is part of OSPO and represents NOAA in the IICWG.  The OSPO Director is currently the Co-Chairs of the IICWG.   The IICWG Co-Chairs relay heavily on the Secretariat's services to maintain the functioning and effectiveness of the organization.</p>
<p>The International Ice Charting Working Group (IICWG), formed in October 1999, is a working group of the world's national ice services to promote coordination of operational sea ice and iceberg information services to better meet the needs of their national and international maritime clients. Through collaboration and cooperation in data sharing, standards, training, product development, research activities, and the delivery of information services, the IICWG aims to enhance the safety of maritime operations in ice-covered waters.</p>
<p>The IICWG works actively with the satellite community to ensure a continuing supply of observations for ice monitoring. Interaction with the community is a regular feature of the IICWG meetings and continues throughout the year. The IICWG has commissioned one report outlining requirements for ice monitoring, contributed to several others and made regular representations to the space agencies and satellite operators.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Secretariat for the International Ice Charting Working Group (IICWG) is to improve the business continuity, coordination and visibility of the IICWG by ensuring the annual IICWG meeting is planned, delivered and the results are captured and distributed to the membership.  The role of Secretariat has improved information management and dissemination within membership and to external agencies which ensures that the business of the IICWG has good visibility and priority within the membership during the intersessional period.</p>
<p>The objective of this RFI is to collect market research information regarding the availability and capability of qualified businesses.

<p>Demonstrated technical knowledge and engagement in the ice analysis field as an internationally recognized expert is required to fulfill the requirement.  With NOAA serving as a chairmanship for North American Ice Services this year and as the co-chair of the IICWG, The Agency has agreed to provide the Secretariat support for the IICWG.</p>
<p>The support requires an individual with in depth knowledge of the mission and objectives of the working group as well as a personal, working relationship with the member countries and representatives.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

Due to a scheduled move of Consulate to NCC in summer of 2017. Riyadh has removed Consulate Jeddah by exercising a Modification to the contract. Now, the move has delayed to summer on 2018 for about 9 months. Consulate Jeddah still require the same service to maintain the current Consulate Compound. Initiating new contract is not feasible in terms of period of performance, logistics, timing and price. Therefore, the contracting office has determined to proceed with the same contractor based on same terms and scope of work of ongoing competed contract SSA 70015C0004, either by issuing monthly or quarterly Purchase orders.<br />
