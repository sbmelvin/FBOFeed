THIS IS A SYNOPSIS AS REQUIRED BY FAR PART 5.2 – THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE/PROPOSAL.  VENDORS SHOULD NOT SUBMIT FORMAL QUOTES/PROPOSALS UNTIL THE RFQ/RFP IS POSTED TO THIS WEBSITE.  45 CONS/LGCB has a requirement for professional structured writing skills for Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI).  The Military Writing Skills Program (MWSP) is an academically structured military writing program specifically designed to improve the military writing skills of DEOMI’s Equal Opportunity Advisor Course (EOAC) students.  The course concept is designed and intended to be a freshman-level, technical writing class for military members.  This assumes some degree of proficiency/skill on the part of the students such as a fundamental grasp of grammar and sentence structure rules.  Although focus is on basic grammar, structure, and style of writing, the goal should be to adapt these lessons to the military style of writing and prepare all future Equal Opportunity Advisors to function in a staff environment.  The Writing Improvement Network (WIN) classes are intended to assist those students who need additional fundamental training.  The WIN’s focus is on re-emphasizing the basic grammar, structure, and styles of writing.  It aims to be a more informal tutorial approach.  This program in its entirety shall provide students with a foundation of military writing skills to prepare them for the written communication requirements they are expected to encounter as Equal Opportunity Advisors.  This service will be conducted at Patrick AFB, FL.  Period of Performance is 1 May 05 thru 30 Sep 05.  Four one year options may be awarded.  The government intends to make a single award to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.  This proposed procurement is a 100% small business set-aside.

It is advertised with a Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 8200, business size of $5.0M and a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 611710.  GSA Schedule holders for this item/service are encouraged to provide us with their GSA Schedule number.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 1 April 05 at www.eps.gov .  Proposals may be submitted via hard copy, fax (321-494-5136), or e-mail.  NO HARD COPIES OF THE SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED FOR ANY REASON.  Anticipated award date will be on or around 18 April 2005.  Point of contact is SSgt Michael J Carlson, 45 CONS/LGCB, 1201 Edward H.

<DESC>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design Federal buildings of outstanding quality and value, buildings that give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  

In this context, the GSA announces a solicitation for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a new multiple tenant Land Port of Entry facility to be occupied by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS-CBP) and the GSA.

<SOLNBR>IFIB-ACT-05-40
<RESPDATE>041705
<ARCHDATE>04182005
<CONTACT>David Newsom, Trade & Industry Analyst - NATO Company Certification, Phone 202-482-7417, Fax 202-482-5650, Email dnewsom@bis.doc.gov
<DESC>The NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT) has released a notification of intent to issue an Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) concerning its plan to hire a contractor(s) to explore new concepts and emerging technologies in order to better manage the design, construction and maintenance of NATO Base Camps to be used by the Deployed Joint Task Force (DJTF)/NATO Response Force (NRF) Headquarters (HQ) during expeditionary operations and to facilitate the hand/take over of the NRF HQ at rotation.

The experiment should consider the NRF missions and Minimum Military Requirements (MMR), NATO multinational environment and formations, the NATO member national laws and regulations, the possible scenarios, and the force protection requirements and common standards of construction (to include sewage, electric, water and power systems and CIS). Further elements to be considered are, force protection, lack of Host Nation Support (HNS), lack of availability of local contractors, the impact of international contractors employment, environmental issues, cost effectiveness and lessons learned.

The deliverables will be a proposal on the design and construction of deployable base camps, which encompasses all the possible necessities of the different NRFs at a MMR, thus achieving maximum interoperability and cost effectiveness and recommendation of possible additional modules (or technologies) for the NRF/DJTF HQ base camp, including a strategy for continued improvement.

This program will be funded by the NATO Military Budget Committee for an estimated $300,000 (1 year base period + 1 year options). Contract selection will follow established International Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures. Partial Bidding is not authorized.

ELIGIBILITY

Eligibility includes companies which have performed similar contracts within the last five years substantially similar in scope to the requirement described in the solicitation.

<DESC>The Marine Corps System Command (MCSC) intends to issue a sole source, five year  Indefinite Delivery  Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), minimum $5M – maximum $30M contract to Scientific Research Corporation (SRC) to fabricate and integrate forty-eight (48) Team Portable Collection System Multi-Platform Capable (TPCS-MPC)  Team and Ground Platform Integration Kits (PIKs).  SRC is the only integrator capable of meeting the required delivery schedule to include the delivery of six (6) kits on or before 31 December 2005 and the remaining kit delivery prior to September 2007.   
This effort will include procurement, fabrication, integration, factory testing, and delivery of the 48 TPCS-MPC systems.  The TPCS-MPC system includes the Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) electronics suite of equipment and a Ground Platform Integration Kit (PIK) .  The primary integration efforts will include the fabrication of the PIKs, system cables, and equipment enclosures.  Integration will also include the installation and factory acceptance testing of the electronics suites.
System Description
The TPCS-MPC will provide the next evolutionary enhancement to the TPCS signals exploitation components and provide a multi-platform functionality for Marine Corps SIGINT operations.  The TPCS-MPC program leverages past TPCS core development efforts, and other service tactical SIGINT system efforts as well as leading edge commercial-off-the-shelf/government-off-the-shelf/non-developmental item (COTS/GOTS/NDI) SIGINT technology insertion.  The TPCS-MPC production effort will not be a “new system development” effort, but rather a systems integration process with primary focus on rapid procurement of readily available COTS/GOTS/NDI technologies and plug-and-play capabilities requiring limited integration to allow rapid production and fielding.  The TPCS-MPC will be the medium element of the full and evolving assortment of tactical SIGINT equipment encompassed by the Marine Corps Family of SIGINT Systems (FOSS) for Light, Medium, and Heavy SIGINT/EW Operational Concepts.
SIGINT Suite
The SIGINT suite component of the TPCS-MPC encompasses those elements of the electronics suite that can be “team transportable” and operable at a stationary site.  The electronics suite of equipment is installed into the Ground PIK.  The SIGINT suite includes equipment enclosures, special purpose SIGINT receivers, scanners, laptop computers, antennas, a telescoping mast, a generator, and all necessary interconnecting cables. The contractor shall deliver 48 SIGINT suites.
Ground PIK
The Ground PIK component of the TPCS-MPC encompasses those ancillary hardware components to facilitate installation of the SIGINT suite onto an organic, non-dedicated High Mobility Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  The PIK provides for the secure installation of the SIGINT components in a rack-mounted configuration into the HMMWV.  The Ground PIK includes a COTS hardtop shelter and external antenna mounting platforms for the HMMWV.  The PIK also provides a power interface with the vehicle’s electrical power source.  The contractor shall deliver 48 Ground PIK. 




This solicitation will be negotiated on a sole source basis with SRC in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  SRC is the original designer of this effort and is the only source capable of meeting the Government’s accelerated delivery schedule to include 6 kits on or before 31 December 2005.

<DESC>CONTACT Barbara Johns,Logistics Management Specialist,732-532-3032.  Title:  Replacement of DOSR subsystem of the GUARDRAIL Common Sensor System 2 CECOM GUADRAIL weapon system teams plans to enter into an agreement for replacement of the Drop On Signal Receiver (DOSR) subsystem that is used on the GUARDRAIL Common Sensor System 2.  The ultimate goal of this market research would be a contract for dev elopment of a replacement for this system.  The current subsystem has numerous vanishing vendor issues and a high sustainment cost.  The contract would also provide for follow on to procure the replacement and for a limited sustainment contract.

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center - Keyport (NUWC) is soliciting for the Advanced Tactical Display Center (ATDC).  This display is used as the display console for the Tactical Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TTWCS) aboard US Naval CG and DDG vessels. The console is the user interface for Tomahawk missile mission planning. The ATDC(V)5 is a fit-function replacement for the ATDC (V)3&4. The ATDC(V)5 is composed of two top-level assemblies; a structural frame and an enclosure housing all of the electronics of the system. Within the structural frame assembly the primary components are the sub-assembly framing pieces (including extruded aluminum frame, desktop, and monitor housing), two flat panel monitors (FPD), an integrated keyboard and trackball, and foot switch. Within the electronics enclosure the primary components are the AC to DC power supply, PS2 extender/amplifier, two fiber optic red-green-blue (RGB) converters, and coaxial and fiber optic cables.  The ATDC(V)5!  design consists of framing and electronics focused on a strong structure with the optimal level of stiffness.  This allows components (electronics, keyboard, and flat panel displays) to remain functional during normal shipboard operating conditions or in the presence of a blast event.  The frame is a bolt together design consisting of commercial off the shelf (COTS) materials and various machined parts.  The COTS material is a high-strength aluminum extrusion utilizing a T-slot design for bolting purposes.  The machined work is a product of design, analysis, and testing performed by NUWC - Keyport.  To reduce cost, non-COTS items are kept to a minimum and used only in places of critical importance.  This design has been qualified for MIL-S-901D, GRADE A, CLASS 1, TYPE A for shock and MIL-STD-167-1, TYPE 1, 4-25 HZ for vibration.

The selected A-E may be required to participate in a pre-fee meeting within seven days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days of the meeting.  The contract will be of the Indefinite Quantity type where the work will be required on an as needed basis during the life of the contract providing the government and contractor agree on the amount.  Each project contract will be a firm fixed price A-E Contract.  The Government will determine the delivery order amount by using rates negotiated and negotiate the effort required to perform the particular project.  The contract shall not exceed twelve months or $2,000,000 total fee; whichever comes first. The Government guarantees a minimum of $10,000.  The Government reserves the option to extend the contract for an additional two years.  There will be no future synopsis in the event the options included in the contract are exercised.  The project limitation is $900,000.  Estimated construction cost of project is between less than $5,000 and $5,000,000.  Estimated date of contract award is June 2005.  Proposals may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  The following selection evaluation criteria, in order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms: (1) Professional qualifications of firm and staff proposed for the design for electrical exterior primary distribution, substations, power generation, secondary distribution, and telecommunications systems and facilities in the Hawaii, Guam, and Pacific Ocean areas; (2) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of firm or particular staff members in the design for electrical exterior primary distribution, substations, power generation, secondary distribution, and telecommunications systems and facilities in the Hawaii, Guam, and Pacific Ocean areas; (3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; (5) Knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts and principles to facilities and infrastructure problems through an integrated design approach; (6) A-Es quality control program experience; (7) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; (8) Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.  For this selection criteria, the government will evaluate proposals based on two Sub-factors:  (A) Past performance in Utilization of Small Business Concerns and (B) Participation of Small Business Concerns in this Project; (9) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense shall also be considered, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had Department of Defense contracts. Include a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria on the SF 330, Part 1, Section H.  If necessary, continue on plain bond paper. For selection criteria (3) the government will also evaluate each firms past performance and performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection outcome.  For selection criteria (8), the Government will evaluate firms by:  In support of Sub-factor (A), (1) the offeror shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB, (2) Information on national awards received within the past three years for outstanding support to SB concerns, (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontracting plans, (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protege agreements under either the DOD or SBA Programs, (5) Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javis Wagner O Day Program and (6) Final SF 294s on projects completed within the past 3 years.  In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contract per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB and SDVOSB.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 05 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 74.8% to SB, 15.7% to SDB, 14% to WOSB, 3.1% to HUBZone SB and 3% to SDVOSB.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed SDBs and HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov<http://www.ccr.gov>.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego, intends to award two sole-source contract actions, one to Science Applications International Corporation of San Diego, CA and one to the Boeing Service Company of Huntsville, AL (teaming with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, NM). The contracts will procure research and development services for the implementation of a complete information technology enabled radiological and nuclear countermeasures system architecture,  the design and fabrication of prototype systems to utilize and interface with existing detection systems, and the development of plans for deployment, training, operation, maintenance and sustainment of the systems.  These two actions are follow-on to procurement contracts N66001-05-C-6005 (Science Applications International Corporation), N66001-05-C-6006 (Applied Research Associates), and other transaction agreement HSHQPA-05-9-0010 (made between Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Boeing Service Company). The contract actions represent a continuation of work initiated by the contractors under the competitive broad agency announcement BAA 04-01 "BAA for Radiological and Nuclear Countermeasure System Architectures Analysis" issued by the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency.  Through the initial contract efforts, the contractors have begun the research and development required to perform the initial architectures analysis.  The follow-on actions will implement the system architecture that is critically needed for homeland security.  The use of any other contractors would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that could not be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays in fulfilling vital security requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals. Government POC:  Terry Metz, e-mail:  terry.metz@navy.mil , telephone:  (619) 553-4467.  See notes 22 and 26.

This acquisition is for coordination and data management of the International Arctic Buoy Program under the United States Interagency Arctic Buoy Program (USIABP).  
 The Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) was established to foster collaboration between NOAA and the University of Washington. The University has served to promote collaboration between NOAA/PMEL scientists involved in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean Climate Studies. The physical research utilizes the semispectral primitive equation model, suitable modified with respect to mixing terms and boundary conditions, and supplemented by analytical calculations. These buoys are used in situ observations of ice thickness to fully understand the changes in the Arctic climate system. In 2004 the USIABP began deploying Ice Mass Balance buoys manufactured by the Cold Regions Research and Environmental Laboratory. The new buoys measure sea level pressure, surface air temperature, ice thickness and temperatures, and snow depth. From these measurements, it is estimated a number of other geophysical quantities such as ocean surface heat flux and heat storage The additional data set contributes to the NASA mission of modeling, analysis and prediction of climate variability and change. In situ ice thickness measurements can also provide valuable validation information for NASA’s new Ice Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite.  
 NOAA will provide funding for the Arctic Buoy program and the purchase of 5 ICEXAIOR & AWI buoys as required to maintain the International Arctic Buoy Program.
Offerors certain they can meet the requirements are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Release a Solicitation for NASA LWS Geospace Radiation Belt Storm Probes Investigations The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) intends to release an Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP) Investigations in June 2005.  These investigations will respond to the overall RBSP mission science objectives to provide understanding, ideally to the point of predictability, of how populations of relativistic electrons and ions in space are formed or changed in response to solar variations.  The RBSP mission will require a variety of instruments to be carried on a two identical spacecraft to be launched in the early 2011 with a prime mission of two years.  The launch services and spacecraft will be NASA-provided resources.  Additionally, investigations proposing to achieve related science objectives through participation in Missions of Opportunity may be selected if their perceived value to the LWS Geospace Program is high.  Proposals in response to this AO will be due 90 days after its formal release. Participation in this AO will be open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S. organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, NASA Centers and other Government agencies. An extended version of this announcement can be found on the Living with a Star Acquisition website at http://centauri.larc.nasa.gov/lws (select “Announcements”). NOTE: Potential proposers should be aware that the Announcement of Opportunity to be released in June 2005 could vary substantially from what is projected in this Notice. Questions or comments about this intention to release an RBSP Investigations AO may be addressed in writing or by E-mail to the NASA LWS Geospace Program Scientist:   Dr. Barbara L. Giles Ref.: LWS RBSP AO Earth-Sun System Division  Mail Suite 3Q39, Science Mission Directorate National Aeronautics and Space Administration Washington, DC 20546-0001 E-mail: Barbara.Giles@nasa.gov (subject line to read "LWS RBSP AO").

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. The Office of Military Cooperation-Afghanistan (OMC-A) Defense Operations  Sector (DOS) Air Corps Plans Team requests assistance in identifying candidate  solutions for  Presidential Airlift (PA) for the Islamic Government of  Afghanistan’s Ministry of Defense (MOD).  OMC-A is supporting the newly  established Islamic Government of Afghanistan (IGOA) to develop the MOD and  the Afghan National Army (ANA), which includes an Army Air Corps. The first  approved Air Corps mission is to obtain a Presidential Airlift capability to  transport the President within the country’s borders by Oct 2005.  The OMC-A  Air Corps Plans Team is interested in obtaining information from industry on  innovative, cost effective, enduring solutions that will form the basis of an  organic Afghan PA capability, and that have inherent flexibility or  scalability to support additional potential ANA Air Corps missions. See attachment for all details. This RFI should provide no basis for speculation that a Government contract  may result from any information submitted or that it will entitle the  submitter of the information any special consideration for any future business  with the Air Force.  The USG does not presently intend to award a contract,  but wants to obtain price, delivery, and other market information, or  capabilities for planning purposes.  The information obtained as the result of  this RFI is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a  solicitation.  It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request  for proposal, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the United States  government (USG).  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted  by the USG to form a binding contract. For more information on APAIRLIFT--RFI for Presidential Airlift for the Government of Afghanistan please refer to http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixslibr/APAIRLIFT/APAIRLIFT.asp

<DESC>Amendment 1 to solicitation is issued as follows:  (1) Government’s reply to contractor’s questions regarding the solicitation.  Question 1: Will GPO provide the contractor with unedited drafts of the yearly reports, or will the contractor receive a variety of background information to be distilled into a single clear, cohesive report? Answer 1: The second is correct.  The Contractor will receive a variety of data to be distilled.  Question 1:  How can the contractor access Applicable Documents b, c, and d to determine the level of effort the formatting will require?  Answer 2:  All of the Applicable Documents are unclassified and can be sent to anyone you  (Maria) designate.  Document A is only available in hardcopy, while Documents b, c, and d are digital and can be put on CD.  I submit that no one needs more that one or two of the documents, such as Documents c and d, in order to make an intelligent assessment of our requirements.  Unless you have a web-site or server where we can put these for ready access, I suggest that you offer to send the last two on CD to any who request them and to state that Documents a and b are physically available at the Geothermal Program Office, China Lake, CA for review.  Question 2: --Will the contractor receive the data as raw data that will be developed into charts and graphs, or will the charts and graphs be provided?  Answer 2:  The Contractor will be responsible for presentation of the data.  As described in the SOW, the Contractor is directed to use Applicable Document letter d as an organizational template.  Question 3: --Will the completed reports contain an index, as well as a table of contents?  Answer 3:  As described in the SOW, the Contractor is directed to use Applicable Document letter d as an organizational template.  Question 4: --Will the photos be provided electronically, as hard copy for scanning, or both?  Answer 4:  All photos are digital - jpg format.  Question 5: --How many pages will the final yearly reports be?  Answer 5:  How many pages will the Contractor require to properly present his review and evaluation of the data?  Again, as described in the SOW, the Contractor is directed to use Applicable Document “d” as an organizational template.   Question 6: --Will the reports be printed? Photocopied? Posted on a web site?  Answer 6:  As noted in Section 3.5 of the SOW, for each reporting year the Contractor shall provide the Government with one (1) paper and one (1) digital copy of the draft final FY04 Report to the GPO (through the COR) for review and comment and then one (1) paper copy and one (1) copy on CD of the final version of the Report in MS Word format compatible with standard PC platforms.  Question 7: --Without more detailed information on these questions, providing a firms, fixed price for each yearly report will be very difficult. Will an hourly rate suffice in addressing the cost of completing the specified tasks?  Answer 7:  No, an hourly rate will not suffice.  I know we can't term this effort a "follow-on contract", but the work completed last year by Contract N68936-03-P-0747 was done as FFP and the other six unsuccessful quoters from that solicitation were also able to propose with a Firm Fixed Price quote.  (2) Instructions to contractor when submitting quotes, as broken down by tasks in accordance with the SOW by Contract Line Item Numbers (CLIN) and by Sub CLIN.  The required tasks to the Base Year, 1st Option, 2nd Option, 3rd Option consist of the following line items:  (Provide your quoted price to the following  Sub Contract Line Item Numbers only).

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is seeking proposals from licensed, qualified engineering consultants to provide structural engineering and construction documents for animal waste pole-framed buildings and covered concrete slabs with side walls.

The proposed structures will provide a covered storage for manure during rain season to prevent manure washing off site.  The buildings will consist of wood framing members with posts embedded into the earth.  Floors, if part of that design, will consist of concrete slabs on grade.  The designs are to include structural and civil design (no electrical, plumbing, heating or ventilation).  Although the buildings in valid agricultural use are exempt from building permits, they must be designed to meet Oregon State Building Code requirements.  All work is to be completed during the period between February 1 and October 31, 2005.

This procurement is reserved for small business. Interested vendors should submit two copies of Standard Form 330 (SF-330) on or before 4:00 p.m. local time on February 11, 2005 to:

	USDA – NRCS
	Attn: Christopher E. Martin
	101 SW Main St.
	Suite 1300
	Portland, OR 97204-3221

NRCS will select the vendor most qualified for the projects described in this solicitation. The selected vendor will be required to submit firm fixed-price proposals for (1) design and (2) construction management with respect to each proposed structure. Award will be made to the selected firm upon successful negotiation of price. Payment will be made for the design phase upon completion of design, and payment will be made for construction management upon completion of construction.

<DESC>The California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Caltech/JPL), operating under a prime contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), seeks responses to a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the acquisition of a spacecraft in support of NASA's New Millennium Program (NMP). BACKGROUND: The Space Technology 8 (ST8) subsystem technology validation mission, as a part of NASA's continuing NMP being managed by JPL, will require the acquisition of a spacecraft, consisting of a spacecraft bus integrated with a JPL-supplied payload, and ground operations/system services. In order to select a provider of the ST8 spacecraft and associated ground operations/system services, JPL will be issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP). NASA has competitively-selected four (4) subsystem technology validation experiments for the ST8 flight mission payload. The ST8 Project Office is responsible for competitively-procuring a spacecraft bus to accommodate the technology experiments. Mission operations and ground system services will be included as part of the spacecraft solicitation and any resultant subcontract.  Given the cost constraints of the NMP ST8 project, modification to an existing spacecraft bus design is the anticipated approach. Although the ST8 mission represents the space flight validation of new technologies, this function will be entirely fulfilled through the technology experiment payloads. The spacecraft bus is not to incorporate new technologies. Some form of flight heritage or application of existing technologies will be required for all spacecraft bus components. The ST8 mission is co-manifested with the WISE mission on a Delta II with a targeted launch date from Vandenberg AFB, California, in December 2008. The mission requirements call for the flight system to be inserted into a sun synchronous elliptical orbit with an apogee above 1000 km altitude to provide a significant radiation environment for one of the ST8 experiments. The overall mission duration is planned to be six (6) months after completion of on-orbit checkout of the flight system. PRE-PROPOSAL BRIEFING: A pre-proposal briefing is planned for April 15, 2005 (two (2) weeks after the planned release of the RFP - location TBD). Those parties planning to attend this briefing should contact Danny Low for details. Mr. Low's email address and phone number have been provided below under the RFP POINT OF CONTACT section of this announcement.  RFP WEBSITE: The RFP will be posted on or about April 1, 2005 on JPL's NMP ST8 Project Spacecraft and Ground System Services RFP website at:   http://acquisition.jpl.nasa.gov/rfp/DL-2671-ST8  There will be a six (6) week proposal response time from the date of RFP issuance. The RFP website will be password protected; therefore, access to this site will be provided only through the RFP Point of Contact representative identified below. Responses will be considered from U.S. providers only.  RFP POINT OF CONTACT: Any inquiries associated with the above synopsis should be directed to the attention of Danny Low at either the email address of danny.low@jpl.nasa.gov or via a phone call to (818) 354-7397.

<DESC>The USMC is determining the feasibility of a Tier II Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) System in a common configuration that supports the requirements of (1) the Office of Under Secretary of Defense Mission Areas, (2) and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Universal Joint Task List (UJTL). 
Marine Corps Regimental and Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) ashore Commanders require an organic UAV to gain a persistent surveillance capability within their area of influence (27-50 nm).  Warfare against a concealed and distributed enemy requires detection, classification, and identification at lower levels than at previous times.  The Tier II UAV system will be operated and maintained at the regimental level and require minimal impact to current infrastructure.  This system will integrate with current C4 network architecture (Threshold), future network centric architecture (Objective).  The Tier II UAV system will specifically conduct:  near real-time Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA); intelligence collection; and convoy operations support.  This capability is needed to improve information support to targeting and target development, situation development, battle damage assessment, and battle management to include communications.  The need is for a day/night, limited adverse weather, multi-sensor collection system that provides needed, near real-time battle information that is unobservable from standoff airborne sensor systems and ground collection systems.
The TIER II systems comprise fully integrated components, including: air vehicle, sensor payloads, C4I interface systems, ground control systems, launch and recovery equipment, and automatic take-off and landing subsystems. The TIER II system will be expected to successfully operate within the mobility and transportability constraints of the Navy and Marine Corps.
With this in mind, Marine Corps Systems Command along with the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory is conducting a market survey to obtain industry input relative to its current capabilities to satisfy an urgent need identified by forces supporting current combat operations.  We desire any information on capabilities and performance of the respondent’s system/air vehicle as it relates to the capabilities in this document.  The system should be at a level of maturity to be utilized in a MCWL sponsored user analysis starting at the end of FY05/start FY06.
Please include in your response information addressing: (1) development status (design verification testing and design/configuration stability) of major subsystems and components; (2) production status of major subsystems and components; (3) availability of design and support documentation such as specifications of major subsystems and components; (4) capability to process and disseminate data; (5) concepts for system(s) load out on a MV-22; (6) business arrangements such as partners or team members who would participate in the production of the system/air vehicle.  
The Air Vehicle must be survivable operating in a non-permissive environment:  If available, (7) provide data on RF, IR, visual and acoustic signatures; (8) estimated production costs for an air vehicle with a Modular Mission Payload (MMP) that includes; electro-optical/infrared/laser range finder and/or IR marker payload and the ability to interchange with future payloads.  Also, the response should include the following specific data: (9) basis for structural design requirements; (10) performance limits (altitude/speed/range) envelope; (11) airspace anti-collision and recognition devices; (12) power required and drag polars; (13) empty and maximum gross weight table; (14) capable of takeoff and landing from an unimproved urban area. Provide data if available on: (15) launch and recovery method.
The response should include the following ground control station data:  (16) basis for control station design requirements; (17) performance limits; (18) human to computer interfaces; (19) estimated production cost for ground control station capable of simultaneous control of multiple air vehicles; (20) compatibility with existing and future Naval C4I systems to include net ready and joint interoperability; (21) open architecture capabilities; and (22) concepts for a common ground control station for Marine Corps UAVs.  
Payload information to include: (23) capability of EO/IR payload to support Tier II missions and provide actionable intelligence; (24) current and future payload capacity (weight and power); (25) recommended future payloads such as communication relay and signals intelligence, including expected costs and schedule.
Information in your response should also address logistics support requirements for both 12 hours continuous operations per 24 hour period for 30 days and 24 hour continuous operations for 10 days; (26) recommended maintenance concept; (27) reliability, maintainability (R&M) data; (28) Training in man hours; (29) Manpower breakdown for system operations and maintenance in man-hours per flight hour; (30) Support Equipment;  (31) hardware, and computer resources;  (32) Packaging, Handling, Storage and Transportation (PHS&T); (33) Facilities, and (34) Supply, to include obsolescence mitigation; and (35) compliance with the DOD single fuel initiative. 
System maturity, as evidenced by demonstrated performance and flight data of major subsystems and components from off-the-shelf systems/air vehicles is highly preferable; lengthy development alternatives are not desired. Interested parties should be willing to allow a site visit by a Government team to review system documentation and related design/test data.  Interested parties should submit a written statement of interest, including a description of the item(s) considered to meet the criteria herein, with the above requested supporting unclassified data, by close of business 9 May 2005, to the Commanding General, MARCORSYSCOM, ATTN: (BMADS PM ADWS, Maj G.

<DESC>Robotic Lunar Exploration Program/Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Micro-Electromechanical System Inertial Measurement Units (MEMS IMU) Request for Information THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. Overview RLEP desires the use of the new MEMS gyro and accelerometers as a technology demonstrator for current and future interplanetary missions.   The use of MEMS technology is to minimize the power and mass needs found in traditional gyro technology such as Ring Laser Gyros, Fiber Optic Gyros, and Hemispherical Resonator Gyros. Requested Response RLEP requests that interested parties provide inputs and suggestions as to how best to acquire three axis, rate and acceleration sensors with the following simultaneous requirements: 1.	Less than 10 watts of total steady state power (including temperature control) 2.	Mass of less 1 kg 3.	Angular Random Walk of 0.03 deg/(hour)^1/2 4.	Bias of 0.001 deg/sec (0.06 deg/hour) 5.	Scale Factor of 10-20 ppm 6.	Angular White Noise of 1 arcsec 7.	Operating temperature -10 C to +50 C 8.	survival temperature -30 C to +75 C 9.	MTBF &gt; 2 years 10.	Radiation total dose 10 krads with 100 mil Al shielding 11.	Radiation Single Event Latchup (SEL) and Single Event Upset (SEU) are to be mitigated through circuit design or radiation hardened parts 12.	Identification of dynamic range and quantization of MEMS IMU output values 13.	Delivery of 1 ETU by 6/1/2007 14.	Delivery of 1 Flight Unit by 12/1/2007 Deviations of the requirements can be considered when clearly identified with proposed alternative requirements from the RFI responder.   The two goals of this RFI are to determine  1.	What is the cost to meet these requirements? 2.	What are the capabilities of a MEMS IMU as a function of total MEMS IMU project cost? Discussions of attitude rate and acceleration sensor system-wide options are encouraged if the overall reliability is improved.    A detailed discussion of how a MEMS IMU design will mitigate radiation effects (total dose, SEUs, and SELs) is encouraged.  This discussion is expected to greatly impact the cost and schedule of any MEMS IMU design.  Therefore, GSFC wishes to better understand the cost savings of using a MEMS IMU which can be used despite a very infrequent and short term (1 second) outage of attitude rate and acceleration data due to radiation effects.  Information submitted to GSFC in response to this RFI will be treated as strictly proprietary unless otherwise indicated.  No procurement is planned as a direct result of this Request for Information.  Information submitted in response to this Request for Information will be used for RLEP mission concept development activities.  Parties proposing concepts of interest to RLEP missions may be invited to submit more detailed information or to discuss their concepts further. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	 No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Technical questions should be directed to:  Jim Simpson at (301) 286-1139 or James.E.Simpson@nasa.gov.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a contract with the University of California, San Francisco, entitled “Collaborative Network for Clinical Research on Immune Tolerance” (also referred to as the Immune Tolerance Network or ITN).  The contract number is N01-AI-15416.  The period of performance for the contract is September 30, 2001 through September 29, 2006.   The Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) is an international consortium of over 80 investigators in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia dedicated to the clinical evaluation of novel, tolerance-inducing therapies in autoimmune diseases, asthma and allergic diseases, and rejection of transplanted organs, tissues, and cells.  To understand the underlying mechanisms of action of the candidate therapies and to monitor tolerance, the ITN has established state-of-the art core laboratory facilities to conduct integrated mechanistic studies, and to develop and evaluate biomarkers and assays to measure the induction, maintenance, and loss of tolerance in humans and animal models of disease.

The NIAID intends to negotiate with the University of California, San Francisco for non-clinical and preclinical studies to evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of selected compounds for the prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases, especially type 1 diabetes.  This work will include, but not be limited to: preclinical toxicology and pharmacology studies in animal models; production of batches or lots of candidate drugs for the conduct of  animal efficacy and human safety studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices; and studies to validate properties of test compounds.   

The development and use of assays and biomarkers to assess the induction, maintenance, and loss of tolerance in humans and animal models, and studies to determine the mechanism of action of tolerance induction strategies are major components of the ITN work statement.  To carry out this work, the Contractor has established sixteen (16) core laboratories that perform mechanistic and tolerance assays for all clinical trials conducted by the Network.  The preclinical and non-clinical work to be undertaken in the expanded statement of work will require the development and use of tolerance assays, biomarkers, and mechanistic studies, which will be integrated into ITN clinical studies, in accordance with current practices.  It is essential to perform this work in the ITN core laboratories to ensure the utility and comparability of such assays and surrogate markers within and across ITN clinical trials.
 
Potential Sources must demonstrate and document: 
1.	Ability to perform the required mechanistic studies and tolerance assays, and ensure the successful completion of assays and studies in development in humans and relevant animal models.
2.	Scientific and technical capacity and expertise to successfully move potential tolerance induction therapies for autoimmune diseases through preclinical evaluation to trials in a clinical immunology research network.

AUTHORITY: The original contract was awarded using full and open competition procedures.  NIAID intends to negotiate this one-time expansion under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) and HHSAR 306.302-1 (a) (2) (ii).  NIAID believes that the University of California, San Francisco is the only source with the requisite unique capabilities to accomplish this additional effort.  See Numbered Note 22.  No Collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is planning to consolidate a subset of the storage systems managed for NIST staff in Boulder, CO and in Gaithersburg, MD. The response to this Request for Information (RFI) is intended to help the OCIO refine the requirements for a proposed acquisition.  The purpose of this RFI is to determine (i) if there are sources capable of providing the government’s requirements; (ii) to determine   availability of commercial items or, to the extent commercial items are available that:  (A) Meet the government’s requirements; (B) Could be modified to meet the government’s requirements; or (C) Could meet the government’s requirements if modified to a reasonable extent. The goal is to implement a common storage solution that will meet the needs of users at both of the NIST campuses located in Gaithersburg, Maryland (~3000 staff) and Boulder, Colorado (~500 staff) as well as consolidating the 
storage infrastructure that is in place at each of these sites.  From the users' 
perspective, the goals are for a secure, rapid, and highly reliable access to their
own data and data that is to be shared with their colleagues from Windows 
XP, Linux, and Unix platforms.  No proposals are being requested or accepted under this synopsis.  Feed back addressing the clarity, feasibility, scope, and potential alternative means of meeting the government’s requirement is sought.  The anticipated North American Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 334112 and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees.  NIST will consider all comments, supportive or critical, but may or not use these individual comments, and in addition, those interested are requested to provide a budgetary estimate for the requirement specified below.  Interested sources are also encouraged to submit product literature in response to the RFI.  NIST will not pay for information or comments submitted, and will not recognize any costs associated with the submission of comments.  NIST is assessing the existence of sources and is requesting written comments from the industry no later than 3:30 PM, Mountain Standard Time, April 11, 2004.  Sources interested in providing comments shall respond in writing to Jacqueline Wright, Contract Specialist, DOC, NIST, MASC, MC3, Acquisition Management Division, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO, 80305.  Submittals may be made via email at jacqueline.s.wright@noaa.gov or by facsimile at 303-497-3163.  Telephone responses are not acceptable.  This is not a Request for Proposals, Invitation for Bid, or a Request for Quotes.
At the NIST Boulder campus there are approximately 700 user and group accounts 
with access to data on a clustered Windows file server. Approximately 3.6TB (Terabytes) of data are stored on this clustered Windows server.  An EMC CX300 SAN (Storage Area Network) with 6TB capacity supports this file server cluster. In addition, the Boulder campus also makes use of a Sun Solaris server. There are approximately 25 active Unix and Linux home and project directories on the Solaris server occupying 200GB of data. The Solaris server has a total capacity of 1.6TB on a JBOD (hard disks arranged in a drawer without a RAID controller). 
At the NIST Gaithersburg campus a Windows cluster with shared SCSI storage supports over 1900 users for home and project directories. Unix and Linux users are supported by a Sun Solaris server with approximately 3.2TB of net direct attached storage, with about 1TB currently used for over 800 home and project directories. A SAN utilizing DataCore SANSymphony software 
with EMC CX600 hardware is also deployed at the Gaithersburg campus but is not currently employed for general client data storage. The Boulder and Gaithersburg sites are currently linked by 4 multiplexed T1 lines, yielding 6 Mbits/sec bandwidth. 
Both sites use IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) for primary system and data backups:
(i)  In Gaithersburg, TSM consists of ~20TB of disk storage, IBM p630 series AIX servers, a 3584 Tape Library [12 Linear Tape Open (LTO) drives], and a Spectralogic T950 Tape Library (6 SAIT drives). Network connectivity is 2Gbit Fibrechannel and 1Gbit Ethernet.
(ii)   In Boulder, TSM consists of ~2TB disk storage, IBM B80 AIX server, 
and two 3583 Tape Libraries ( 7 LTO drives). Network connectivity is 1Gbit Fibrechannel and 1Gbit Ethernet.
Unless otherwise noted, all technical requirements are equally applicable to both NIST sites.
Availability and User Response Times:
-Users will have access to the data stored on the system 99.91% of clock time (i.e., unscheduled downtime due to hardware and/or 
software failures will be no more than 8 hours per year).  Explain how levels of redundancy lower or higher than our goal lead to different 
costs and configurations.
-Vendors are encouraged to provide literature of availability in currentinstallations or through published case studies or articles.
-For proposed solutions that employ clustering technology, provide the ability for one of the nodes to handle full or partial operations for both 
node's services while one of the units is being serviced.
-For proposed solutions that employ clustering technology, identify physical and/or logical limitations regarding the physical distance between nodes.
-Users of the new infrastructure will not suffer any degradation in performance as compared to the existing infrastructure.
Recoverability:
-Provide both manual and scheduled snapshot capabilities and enable system administrators to have fine-grained control over the scope and frequency of multiple snapshots. Explain software licensing costs pertaining to differing snapshot capabilities; our intention is to maintain 10 snapshots at any point in time.      
-Provide the ability to replicate data asynchronously across sites at specified intervals, with capability to throttle or control bandwidth, 
such as limiting replication to a percentage of full link bandwidth.
-Provide point-in-time recoveries within the time window of the on-line snapshots.
-Provide fibre channel connection between the proposed storage 
solution and the existing IBM TSM infrastructure.
-In the event of a major system or subsystem failure that requires restoration of user data from the tape media managed by TSM, it must be possible to restore a minimum of 1TB of data per 24 hours.
Client Access
-Provide for user clients to connect via 10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet, with the number of network interfaces appropriate to the number of clients at each site.
-Provide a unified filesystem that both Windows and Linux/Unix 
clients can simultaneously access. 
-Client authentication and access should be compliant with Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and Active Directory schemas.
-Provide filesystem/directory/file access controls that adequately address Common Internet File System (CIFS) and Unix differences and commonalities among groups, read/write/modify/delete controls, and implement file locking 
methods for concurrent user access. If your solution uses Samba for multi-protocol file access, please identify that fact.
-Provide a network file virtualization capability that enables
continued access to network-based files by end users even when the location of the network file changes, with no changes required by the end user.
Management:
-The system should be manageable through a single interface from multiple locations in a secure manner utilizing FIPS-compliant encryption (3DES or AES).
-Provide secure and authenticated web or command-based access secure shell (ssh)-compatible).  Management user authentication should be based on LDAP or Active Directory structures.
-Management of both sites' solutions from one graphical interface sharing one set of user and access controls would be preferable but not required. Separate but equivalent management interfaces is tenable. A system to lock or manage configuration changes should prevent concurrent management users from de-stabilizing the management software.   
-Provide for automatic expiration of passwords for access control and comply with the Commerce Department's password policies (see http://www.osec.doc.gov/cio/itmhweb/policy%20on%20password%20management.htm). 
-Provide the ability to set both soft (warning) and hard (absolute)storage quotas on a user's home or a group's project directories.
-Provide the ability to create notifications when the soft quota is reached.
-Provide the ability to create reports of storage usage by directory.
-Provide the ability to both grow and shrink the size of filesystems 
while they are in use.
-Provide the ability to upgrade and patch the operating system while the system is fully operational. Provide the ability to upgrade/patch firmware or ROM (commonly necessary for hardware components such as network interfaces, disk drives, and chassis) while the system is fully operational.
-Provide the ability to insert and remove ("hot-swap") disk drives,drive controllers, and power supplies from the chassis while the system is fully operational.
-Provide system management software features that include: 
configuration management controls, change history, configurable 
system logs, ability to roll back changes, multiple binary system images.
Capacity:
-For the Boulder site: Provide for 3TB of net user storage (without snapshots) with the capability to expand to a capacity of 32TB of net user storage.
-For the Gaithersburg site: Provide for 3TB of net user storage (without snapshots)with the capability to expand to a capacity of 32TB of net user storage.
Redundancy:
-Provide the capability to replicate the net user storage directly within the system (snapshot capability).
-Provide a configuration such that the loss of one entire disk drive in an array will have no effect on the integrity or availability of the data on the array to which the failed drive belongs.
Hierarchical Storage Management:
-A majority of current user data is static over a period of months.  Provide a configuration that allows us to mix Serial ATA (or equivalent-cost disk storage) with faster fibre channel technology disk storage (or equivalent).
-Provide features that will allow us to manually move data from 
faster/expensive storage to slower/inexpensive storage as well as to perform this function automatically according to criteria we specify.
Migration:
-A fundamental goal shared by both those who provide storage 
services and those who use those services is that migration from the current infrastructure to a new infrastructure shall require less than 48 hours of downtime (zero downtime would be optimal).
-Data integrity will be maintained during and after migration,
including access control structures of directories and files.
-Users' existing CIFS and NFS shares will be seamlessly migrated to the new system, retaining CIFS sharenames.
RFI Response:
-Identify which technical requirements above you can meet (and how you meet them) as well as those you cannot.
-Provide a rough quotation of a proposed solution to allow us to determine whether the scale of the solution is within general limits of our project budget.
-Enumerate details of which network technologies are supported by the NAS head (Gbit Ethernet, switched FC or FC-AL) and what kind of disk storage is supported behind the same NAS head (FC, SATA, iSCSI). Will the solution support the next generation of Ethernet, at 10Gbps, and FibreChannel, at 4 or 8Gbps, and if so, what is the process for that upgrade?
-What kind of CPUs and I/O backplanes does your solution use? How many CPUs are supported in one NAS head?
-Provide a rough quotation of the cost to expand the proposed
solution.  Beyond adding or replacing disks, what additional costs are associated with increasing disk storage, in increments, up to the solution's storage limit, i.e. licensing, firmware, controllers, disk enclosures?
-Include an estimate of the yearly cost of software and hardware maintenance, with 24x7, 4-hour response time, on-site and phone support, as well as the initial service or warranty period included with the initial purchase of the system.
-Provide a detailed description of the method for dealing with the interoperability of NFS and NTFS enumerated access control lists(ACLs). Describe what limitations Windows clients have in using files that have NFS ACLs, and limitations Solaris/Linux clients have using files that have NTFS ACLs.
-Include an architectural diagram of the solution proposed by your company so we may note the relationship of the system components to our existing network infrastructure.
-Identify whether there will there be any loss to metadata such as timestamps and permissions during the migration to the new system? Describe the migration method in detail.
-Explain how the proposed system can use the backup and restore 
capabilities of IBM's Tivoli Storage Manager, whether by direct 
client-based backup or whether via an intermediate host. 
Alternatively, what backup system is recommended or has been tested with this solution?
-Explain whether the proposed solution has been tested in conjunction with Legato or Veritas backup software solutions. Does the solution support NDMP(Network Data Mgt. Protocol)-based backups?
Capacity questions:
-What is the maximum useable capacity, in Terabytes, of the solution. What is the largest filesystem that can be 
created? On the fly, can filesystems and LUNs be expanded or 
contracted, and disk storage be added? 
-Replication questions: Does the solution support block-based data replication as well as file-based replication; disk-to-disk replication based on configurable policies (ie. size of file, file last accessed, etc.)?
-RAID questions: Is RAID done in software or hardware? What types of RAID are supported?
-Snapshot questions: Does the solution support block-based 
incremental snapshots?  Is there a maximum number of snapshots the solution can take? Is there a performance degradation while a snapshot is performed? Can snapshots be accessed directly by the end user?
-Include in the proposed rough cost what is necessary for your 
company's technical representatives to do pre-installation planning, full physical and software installation and configuration in concert with NIST team members, and training for approximately 12 NIST staff in the operation of the system.
-Supply an idea of the continuous and/or peak data 
throughput rate in Megabytes/sec or peak user transactions/sec as a gauge to estimate how the proposed solution may be able to handle the traffic during typical peak times during the work day from, for instance, many users logging in at the beginning of the work day.
-If it is possible, please detail how the proposed solution can manage or virtualize the existing EMC CX300 and CX600 SAN. 
infrastructure, or any other Fibre Channel-based or SCSI storage units that may be included in a storage pool.
-Explain the hardware upgrade path of the proposed solution.
-NIST requests a reference from one of your customers who has an equivalent system, and who will allow us to contact them for 
questions.

<DESC>The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) seeks information from commercial sources regarding their interest and ability to support the “Produce Department” needs of the agency. DeCA currently operates 250 military commissaries worldwide with annual sales estimated at $358 million. Of that total, 180 stores are located within the continental United States (CONUS), Alaska, and Hawaii. Within the latter group, the annual sales for the Produce Section are estimated at $300 million. DeCA does periodically close existing or open new facilities.

A military commissary is a Government facility providing grocery and other merchandise to authorized individuals, termed “patrons.” It is a facility designed and operated similar to commercial supermarkets. DeCA’s goals are to provide a significant price savings (approximately 38%) when compared to commercial markets; to provide courteous and informative assistance; to offer a variety of items in quantities and of a quality level to satisfy patron demands; and to provide products in a clean, safe, and wholesome environment. Overall management and operation of a commissary is the responsibility of the Store Director of each store, operating within Agency policy and standards.

DeCA currently obtains its CONUS fresh produce from various sources, including national, regional and local suppliers, through contracts established by the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) at the Defense Supply Center — Philadelphia (DSC-P), and salads and value-added products through Resale Order Agreements (ROA) established at DeCA HQ. Under these contracts, the vendors are responsible for providing and transporting products on both a short and long-term basis to the store location specified, whether through internal resources or through the use of distributors. DLA currently obtains fresh produce for the Far East through in-theater purchases and product transported from CONUS by air and surface and  for the European by in-theater purchases, except for salads and value-added products which are airlifted from CONUS under the ROA. When the product is received at the store, ownership of the product passes to DeCA. The product is received, stored, handle, stocked and merchandised by DeCA internal resources, for subsequent resale to the store patrons.

It is, and shall remain, the policy of the Government to provide the maximum practicable opportunity for small and small disadvantaged business concerns to participate in its acquisitions. This includes providing the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors, consistent with efficient contract performance.

DeCA seeks information from interested commercial sources on the following proposed scenario for DECA stores:

Scenario:  Provide all of the necessary products for the Produce Department 180 store locations within the CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii, and 70 stores located overseas.  The contractor or contractors that may receive awards under any resulting solicitation would serve as the primary point-of-contact for produce items, and would be responsible for all requirements from determination of appropriate stock assortment (as defined by DeCA) to product acquisition and store delivery.  In-store operations (receiving, storage, handling, stocking, merchandising, etc.) would continue to be performed by DeCA in-store personnel.




FedBizOpps - Request for Information (RFI)
DeCA - PRODUCE DEPARTMENT STUDY


DeCA is interested in receiving information from interested commercial sources that addresses the following, as a minimum:

1.  The concept that a commercial source would employ to provide the necessary products and or related services described under the scenario above.

2.  The concepts should include such things as:

a.	Proposed groupings of store locations. For example, although the requirement is to cover all 250 locations, there may be logical “groupings” or “clusters” for the individual stores by regions and/or countries.

b.	Methodology to be used for product selection, in each store or cluster. DeCA will specify a “core” list of products that must be provided (see Attachment # 3), and the contractor would be expected to supplement that list with additional products, based on other appropriate criteria. Information provided should include such things as the contractor’s plan to coordinate ordering, receipt, inspection, and transportation.

c.	Proposed strategies for providing measurable department sales, patron savings, and patron satisfaction data to DeCA management. Provide your strategy for product pricing that would allow for adjustment due to market fluctuations while maintaining the percentage of patron savings when compared to commercial markets.  Any contracted solution would need to be capable of interfacing with the DeCA automated business systems.

d.	Proposed strategies and methods for providing subcontracting opportunities to small and small disadvantaged business concerns..

f.	Other issues that DeCA should consider before pursuing this scenario.

Additional information regarding the specific interests of DeCA can be found at Attachment # 4, entitled “Produce Section Requirements”.

Attachment # 5, entitled “Business Information”, is to be completed by each respondent to this announcement.

Any questions regarding this initiative should be referred to the point-of-contact cited below.  Contact with the individual stores is discouraged. In the event that an offeror has specific questions or a need to visit a store or stores, that will be coordinated from a central location at Fort Lee, Virginia.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) BEING RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) PART 10, MARKET RESEARCH. 

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) seeks public comment on 
Section 508 Conversion Tool for Converting MS-Office Documents to Section 508-Compliant HTML.

This request for information is being posted on behalf of the Department of Transportation (DOT) Operating Administrations (OA) that are listed below:

Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST)
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)
Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
Maritime Administration (MARAD)
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
Office of the Inspector General (OIG)
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)
Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA)
Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (SLSDC)
Surface Transportation Board (STB)

BACKGROUND:

The DOT OA’s have varying processes for posting information on web pages.  Some have web teams that handle all of the development, testing, and posting.  While in other OA’s, program offices develop documents that need to be posted and forward them to the web team for testing and posting.  Regardless of the process, all documents posted on Federal Agency web pages must comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, which requires that information be accessible to people with disabilities.  For many documents, this can best be achieved by creating an HTML version of the document.  

The DOT uses Microsoft ® Office as its standard office automation suite.  The tools in the suite (e.g. Word, Excel, PowerPoint) have a native “Save as Web Page” feature that creates HTML that is coded in so that the documents can easily be opened back up in the tool in which the document was created.  Unfortunately, this HTML currently does not conform to the standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3) or the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards.

The DOT is exploring alternatives to the native “Save as Web Page” feature for documents authored and modified using Microsoft ® Office.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

At a minimum, the Section 508 conversion tool must:

1.	Have the ability to convert documents created using Microsoft ® Office (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) into HTML that conforms to:
a.	HTML 4.01 Transitional or higher, as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium
b.	Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards, Conversion includes but not limited to:
i.	Identify and apply headings to data tables,
ii.	Associate table data cells with their respective headings,
iii.	Provide the ability to insert alternative text to meaningful images,
iv.	Provide the ability to insert blank alternative text for decorative images (example alt=””),
v.	Provide the ability to textually describe charts and graphs,
vi.	Provide the ability to explicitly label embedded form fields,
vii.	Provide the ability to group embedded images/objects that collectively form a graph, chart, equation, formula etc. – Desirable, but not required,
c.	Render the compliant HTML to XHTML standards – Desirable, but not required;
 
2.	Itself be compliant with the applicable Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards;

3.	Be compatible with Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 2 or more recent; and

4.	Being a plug-in to MS-Office ®, as opposed to a standalone tool, is desirable, but not required.

OTHER:
There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. Responses are being solicited on how your approach / solution address our functional requirements.  Include product specifications (software / hardware) requirements and an estimated pricing on an individual and volume basis. NO SAMPLES / TRIAL VERSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED AT THIS STAGE.  The due date for the responses is May 6, 2005.     This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor’s information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified as such.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Attached document contains all hyperlinks for further information.  Responses including the specified documentation shall be e-mailed to: Angel.Delgado@fhwa.dot.gov or Rick.Murray@fhwa.dot.gov. No facsimile response will be accepted.

<DESC>Air Mobility Command (AMC), is hosting AMC Industry Day 2005 at Scott AFB, IL 1-3 June 2005.  The objective of this event is to provide a forum for industry and research conduits to present maturing technologies that can be rapidly fielded.  Our focus will be on available technology solutions to support warfighter’s operational capabilities.  The sight picture highlights
technologies ready for transition to the field within the next eight years to support the following topic areas:

·	FORCE PROTECTION 
o	Aircraft Survivability 
o	Air Refueling 
o	Precision Airdrop 
o	Autonomous All-Weather Landing

·	BASE OPENING
o	Force Protection
o	Operations Support in Austere Environments

·	INFORMATION SUPERIORITY

Briefing sessions are the primary medium for this forum.  Each day will have 8 briefing sessions (4 in the morning and 4 in the afternoon).  The nominal breakdown for each of the sessions is:

Brief - 40 minutes
Q&A - 10 minutes
Break - 10 minutes.  

We will hold the briefings in the Global Reach Planning Center,  on Scott AFB.  Audience attendance is limited to military, civilian government officials, and government contracted subject matter experts with signed non-disclosure statements so briefings can be open to "Proprietary Only" discussions.  Using the briefing session scheme described above, there are 48 time slots with the potential for up to 72.  This number depends on the response to this call for briefings.  In addition to the briefing sessions, Scott Club will exhibit/display tables and an ice-breaker for one-on-one interaction.
  On Thursday 2 June 2005, the Scott Club will be available for table-top displays and exhibits for interested staff officers and leadership to stop by when available.  The goal is to provide an opportunity for AMC staff to interact with Industry and Lab representatives on a one-on-one basis.  Also, after the 2 June briefing sessions, we will host an Ice-breaker in this open forum at the Scott Club to further provide opportunity for interaction.  Due to limited space and power availability, we only have room for 20 exhibits tables and limited poster board presentations.
  If you intend to brief/exhibit/demonstrate a technology, we request exhibit requirements (to include space and power) and a two-page executive summary/abstract to us No-later-than 4:00 p.m on Thursday,7 Apr 05.  Due to the limited time slots available, a selection process will be applied, if response dictates, based on applicable topic areas.

STATEMENT OF WORK
A.   BACKGROUND:  To reduce the threat of exotic pest introductions in the United States, a primary responsibility of APHIS-International Services (IS) is to manage pest risks at the point-of-origin, i.e., off-shore.  One of the most damaging agricultural pest groups threatening U.S. agriculture is the Tephritidae family of fruit flies. APHIS-IS cooperates with foreign countries in surveillance and control programs of economically significant fruit flies including the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) and the Mexican fruit fly.  Other exotic and destructive fruit flies of immediate risk to the U.S. from Latin America and the Caribbean include West Indian fruit fly, sapote fruit fly, guava fruit fly and South American fruit fly.  The identification of sources and pathways of plant pests including these fruit flies is important for formulating efficient exclusion and mitigative strategies.   
To further safeguard U.S. agriculture, APHIS-IS has recently implemented the International Safeguarding Information Program (ISIP) that involves the placement of safeguarding specialists overseas.  The primary task of these specialists is to gather international pest information which is necessary to identify the risk potential of commodities exported to the United States.  
A.  OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE OF WORK:  To determine the probability of establishment and spread of fruit flies associated with changes in management strategies, and recommend appropriate mitigative strategies commensurate with the risk.  The objective is to provide the scientific basis for the off-shore component of APHIS’ fruit fly strategic plan that is currently being developed.  
To provide training to the new safeguarding specialists on emerging pest and disease situations and risk assessment methods for the purpose of enhancing performance and ability to gather relevant pest information that will be useful for evaluating and mitigating the threat of invasive species entry into the United States.   
The Contractor will be required to attend scheduled meetings at 4700 River Road, Riverdale, MD. The Contractor shall provide all labor, facilities and materials necessary for the accomplishment of this statement of work.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
'Expanded Affiliated Group' means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

'Foreign Incorporated Entity' means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This is an unrestricted procurement. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27. The U.S. Coast Guard Aircraft Repair & Supply Center (ARSC) intends to award a firm-fixed price contract.    

NOTE:  Drawings are not available.  A site visit will be required prior to submitting an offer.  Contact for site visit information is Mr. Gene Byrum, at 252.335.6246.  Award will be made to the low-price, technically acceptable offer, subject to the availability of funds.

This statement of work is for the manufacture of a center work stand for use in the sheet metal section of the HH60 product line at ARSC.  The stand shall be made to act as a center work platform between two aircraft.  The main platform of the stand should be 18 ½ feet long x 8 feet wide x 92 inches high.  The stand should include a set of removable steps that meet all OSHA requirements.  There should be lockable casters on each section.  The platform should have a set of form boards that run the length of the main platform and have the ability to extend approximately three to four feet to meet the contour of the aircraft.  The ends of the extendable boards should be equipped with some means to protect the aircraft from potential damage.  The extendable boards should extend and retract with a reasonable amount of force.  The stand should be equipped with plumbing or air, and hose reels (3) on each end.  There should be six electrical outlets (three each side) and four fluorescent work lights under the stand.  Shelving shall be installed under the staircase for storage.  The stand should have two gates on the forward section to mate with the existing system that is on that stands currently in the shop.  There need to be removable stanchions and chains on the sides.  These chains act as fall protection when there is no aircraft in that area.

The contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer when noncompliance's with any of the requirements set forth below are noted so that corrective action may be taken.  The contractor will within 24 hours after such notification give the Contracting Officer disposition instructions for such items.  If the contractor elects for the Coast Guard to correct the deficiency, the Coast Guard may assess the actual costs for correcting the deficiency.  The contractor agrees that the total actual cost may be deducted from the invoiced amount prior to payment.  An estimate of the cost for the Coast Guard to correct noted deficiencies will be provided at the time the contractor is notified of any noncompliance’s.

Early and partial deliveries are desired and acceptable as long as there are no additional charges to the government.

ACQUISITION REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR NEW MATERIAL ONLY.  The items being procured are end items.  Acquisition requirements are for new material only.  The items being procured are piece parts used in the repair of the ATF3 engine and associated components.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  Sources shall be certified by the FAA or the OEM.  ALL parts must be OEM certified or if the awardee is other than the OEM, the awardee must be capable of providing OEM manufactured parts with traceability.  Tracebility means that the awardee must be able to show a clear, documented, auditable paper trail for ownership and transfer of each part, from the OEM to the final vendor.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 


(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Sealed offers for the items to be provided shall be hand-carried or express mailed via UPS or Federal Express to the following location by 2:00PM (EST) 08 April 2005: COMMANDER, Attn: Ms.Stefanie Conway, CTQ, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester Street, VA, 22314-5010.  NOTE: Offerors are advised that proposals sent by conventional US Mail service are not routed directly to the above address.  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999).  Evaluation Factors:  Operational Effectiveness - Describe your ability to currently meet the performance requirements stated in this purchase description.  Ensure that your stated response addresses overall product compatibility, as well as any additional parameters not specifically cited in the purchase description.  Address any specific commercial or extended warranty provisions for the resulting product.  Past Performance - Provide specific examples of favorable recent past performance that illustrates evidence of your ability to produce, deliver, and warrant your product.  Ensure the past performance information includes names of technical and contracting officials, telephone numbers, addresses, e-mail, name of the product purchased, quantities, dates of the resulting contract, contract value, contract number and a description of the items procured.  Relative Order of Importance:   (i) Operational Effectiveness - Most important. (ii) Past Performance - Less important. Price - Evaluated, but not rated. Award shall be made to the offeror whose proposal presents the best value to the government.  In making its "Best Value" determination, the Government will consider overall technical and past performance merit to be of significantly greater importance than evaluated price.  However, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination will increase with the degree of equality in the overall merits of the proposals.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations.  FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.O.B. Destination.. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:     Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form. Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided. Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.                                STATEMENT OF WORK 1. DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The contractor will support the Defense Acquisition History Project by preparing a short monographic history of government labs and arsenals, 1945-2000, involved in the military acquisition process, focusing on their role in the dev elopment of major weapons systems and their primary components and their relationship with other defense organizations in these efforts.  The study should also encompass the growing role of private and commercial firms in this work as well as that of acade mic institutions.  This study will be completed under the direction of the Centers chief historian and in coordination with other project historians, comply with the Center of Military Historys Manuel of Style, and be available in an electronic format co mpatible to WORD word-processing software used by the US Army Center of Military History.  In addition, the contractor will assist in reviewing and revising those project chapters and studies that intersect with his field of expertise, participate in the m onthly project seminars focusing on various acquisition topics, and provide material for the project newsletter; the archival, oral history, and case study data bases; the transcribed oral history collection; and the hardcopy archives. 1.1	Based on guidance from the chief historian, the author will prepare a specialized study on the role of defense labs, arsenals, and similar institutions in the development of major weapons systems since the Second World War, with appropriate attention p aid to the issues of effectiveness, efficiency (costing), and timeliness (scheduling).  While an overview without the detail of a case study, the history should consider the interaction of these offices with one another, with similar private and commercial  firms, and with the larger defense acquisition and procurement organizations, paying special attention to trends and changes that impact on the acquisition process during the period.  The resulting study should be approximately 100 to 125 double-spaced ty pescript pages, to include source citations, follow the Centers Manuel of Style, and be available in an electronic format compatible with word-processing software used at the Center. 1.2	Based on direction from the chief historian, the author will review at least four project chapters of 50 to 100 pages, or their equivalent, for comprehensiveness, balance, accuracy, clarity, and grammar, and suggest or make revisions as appropriate.  T hese efforts will also follow the Centers Manuel of Style, and be available in an electronic format compatible with word-processing software used at the Center. 1.3	The contractor will participate in monthly seminars and similar meeting to discuss aspects of the Defense Acquisition History Project germane to the effort. 1.4	The contractor will support the periodic Acquisition History Newsletter with at least one page worth of information relating to his specific research. 1.5	The contractor will support the Projects Case Study and Oral History data publications by submitting appropriate material to the project archivist as it becomes available during the course of his research. 1.6	The contractor will support the Projects archival objectives by maintaining his own hardcopy archives and by nominating key documents for the Projects automated database and/or for their incorporation into the Projects archival documents volume, its  Web Site, and/or its newsletter. 1.7 The contractor will provide his own work space and IT equipment to perform the above tasks. 1.8 The contractor will turn in monthly reports outlin ing his progress during the past month and forecasting his major tasks for the next. 2. CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY: The Centers Chief Historian, assisted by the Chief, Histories Division, will provide overall direction of this work.  The Center itself will furnish certain supporting services, to include office supplies, reproduction servi ces, storage containers, and research assistance, to include the facilities of the Centers library and archives branch.   3. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 12 months.  4. EVALUATION CRITERIA:  LOWEST PRICE TECHANICALLY ACCEPTABLE PRICE FACTOR: The degree to which the proposed cost/price is reasonable, realistic, and competitive.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included with this notice. This commercial item acquisition is being conducted in accordance with subpart 13.5. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is HSCG23-05-R-DSA020 and it is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26. This solicitation is a small business set-aside. The NAIC code is 332992 and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) will award a firm-fixed-price, Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery type contract for the purchase of .40 caliber full metal jacket (ball) ammunition to support the USCG’s new service handgun (SIG SAUER P229R-DAK).  International convention identifies full metal jacket (ball) as the ammunition to be used by combatants who are party to the convention.  As such, USCG operations often involve deployment to hostile areas and are subject to said requirements.  Currently, the USCG does not have an established source of supply for .40 caliber full metal jacket (ball) ammunition either through the Department of Defense or other Federal Government agencies and as such, is seeking to put in place an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure the required ammunition.  The contractor shall provide the ammunition to the following standards:  Projectile caliber:  .40 caliber.  Projectile weight:  155 grains.  Projectile muzzle velocity:  1190 feet per second + 30 feet per second.  Projectile shape:  full metal jacket (ball).  Projectile construction:  lead core with a copper jacket.  Pressure:  The maximum pressure shall not exceed SAAMI specifications for the .40 S & W per ANSI/SAAMI Z299.3.  Cartridge:  The cartridge shall conform to the American National Standards Institute, Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute (ANSI/SAAMI) physical dimensions as defined in ANSI/SAAMI Z299.3 for .40 S & W ammunition.  Cartridge case construction: Cartridge casings shall be constructed of new, unfired brass.  Accuracy:  The desired Grouping shall have an average radius of no greater than 1.5 inches for five (5), five shot groups fired at a distance of 25 yards.  

The minimum quantity is 2,000,000 rounds over the life of the contract.  The maximum quantity is 2,000,000 rounds per year and 6,000,000 rounds for the total period of performance.  The period of performance shall be from date of award through 365 days thereafter, with two one-year option periods.  Prices for CLIN 0001 will be used for orders placed from contract award through 365 days (Base Period).  Prices for 1001 will be used for orders placed during Option Period 1 and prices for 2001 will be used for orders placed during Option Period 2.  The anticipated delivery schedule is 60 days after the initial award of the first Delivery Order for the first 200,000 rounds, with each increment of 200,000 rounds that are ordered to be delivered at a rate of 30 days thereafter for that Delivery Order and all subsequent orders.  No delivery should exceed 200,000 rounds at any given time, unless otherwise specified by the Contracting Officer.  Should Delivery Orders be placed prior to completion of a Delivery Order already in place, the first delivery date for that next Delivery Order shall be 30 days after the last shipment is shipped from the previous Delivery Order, such that there is not an overlap in deliveries from one Delivery Order to the next, unless otherwise specified by the Contracting Officer.  The technical point of contact is GMCS Tim Knight, (717) 605-8598.  The Contracting Officer is Ms. Jennie Peterson (202) 475-3215.

Offerors are required to submit at least 3 relevant past performance references.  Current, accurate, complete information MUST be provided to contact each reference.  This should include contract number, point of contact, phone number and email address for each contact.  These evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Total evaluated price will be calculated by multiplying unit prices by the maximum annual quantities and summing the totals.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
