<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters Division, Patuxent River, MD intends to award a Sole Source Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Honeywell International Inc. Defense and Space Electronic Systems, Albuquerque, NM for the procurement, management, and storage of an estimated quantity of 520 Low Voltage Deep Sync FIFO devices  (P/N: CU7C4285-15ASI).  The items will deliver and ship in place at the contractor's facility, Albuquerque, NM and be stored in a facility appropriate for electronic devices.  The Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA209) has a requirement to protect production and repair capability of the Advanced Multi-Purpose Display (AMPD) and Advanced Multi-Purpose Color Display (AMPCD) which is part of the Advanced Mission Computer and Displays (AMC&D) system for F/A-18 aircraft.  This commercial component of the AMPD and AMPCD is going obsolete.  The requirement to protect retrofit production and repair support necessitates the procurement of a life of type buy for the Low Voltage Deep Sync FIFO devices, along with the management and storage of the parts throughout production and lifecycle support.  There are no other known parts that meet form, fit, function replacement requirements.    Honeywell is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the AMPD and AMPCD as well as the designated repair facility, and as such is the only source capable of procuring, managing and storing these parts to protect retrofit production and life-cycle support of the AMPD and AMPCD.  This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."

<DESC>THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE IS BEING ADVERTISED AS A SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE.  The Request for Proposal will be issued on or about February 5, 2007. Full proposal will be found on Naval Facilities E-Solicitation site at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil/.  A pre-proposal conference and site visit is currently scheduled on or about 13 February, 2007.  The proposal due date is currently scheduled on or about March 22, 2007.

The size standard is $28,500,000.00.  This is a fully designed project with a construction project dollar range between $20,000,000 and $26,000,000.  The estimated performance period for design and construction is 554 days from contract award.

1. PROJECT TITLE:  CONSTRUCTION OF A CONSOLIDATED FUEL FACILITY AT NAVAL AIR STATION WHIDBEY ISLAND, OAK HARBOR, WA

2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION.  This is a fully designed project consisting of the following major categories of work:

(1)  Fuel Storage Tank Construction.  This project includes the construction of a large consolidated fuel facility consisting of three (3) 30,000 barrel above-ground steel tanks with floating pans to store JP-8 jet fuel.  These field constructed tanks will be built to the American Petroleum Institute API - 650 standards.  Two (2) 40,000 gallon commercial aboveground steel tanks will be built for JP-5 fuel storage.  Dual fuel pump & filter house, four (4) lanes of loading/unloading stations for fuel trucks, secondary containment structures, cathodic protection, automatic tank gauging, storm drainage, site utilities, fire protection, emergency generators, access pavements, fencing, lighting and security systems will be required.  At another location, this project upgrades fuel booster pumps to increase fuel transfer rate on the existing cross island pipeline which will connect the new consolidated fuel facility with the existing fuel pier for barge delivery approximately 6 miles away.        

(2) Fuel Operations Building Construction.  This project includes the demolition of an existing fuels operations building and construction of a new facility of approximately 3,400 square feet (SF).  The new building will house the fuel manager?s office, dispatch office, driver ready room, fuel laboratory and a small shop for limited repair to fuel trucks.  The new building also consolidates all the instrumentation related to fuel truck dispatch, existing pipeline leak detection system, new tank gaging systems, and other instrumentation related to pipeline fuel transfer operations.

(3) Decommissioning of Existing Fuel Farms.  This project will close, in place, 16 existing field constructed underground fuel tanks ranging in age from 50 - 60 years old.  The tanks are located at four (4) separate fuel farms; two (2) near the Seaplane Base fuel pier; and two (2) at Ault Field Naval Air Station across the island.  The existing fuel storage facilities includes approximately 13 concrete tanks at 250,000 gallons each, two (2) steel tanks at 560,000 gallons, and one (1) steel tank at 154,000 gallons.  The tanks will be cleaned, tank closure samples taken, and reports prepared.  The tank shells will be closed in place by filling with soil.  The tank pump houses and all aboveground features will be demolished.  Underground piping within the tank farms and one of the two cross island pipelines will be flushed, capped and operationally closed.  

(4) This contract will be structured to include a base bid item and several optional items.  The base bid item will be awarded.  Options will be awarded as funding is made available, either with initial contract award or up to 120 days after contract award.  The base bid item is for the Fuel Storage Tank Construction.  Option items will be the Automatic Tank Gauging Equipment for tanks 1 through 3, Automatic Tank Gauging Equipment for Tanks 4 & 5, Physical Security Equipment, Emergency Generators, Fueling Truck Rack Canopy and Weather Shelters, Tank Closure and Demo of Fuel Farm #1, #2, #3, #4, New Fuel Ops Building, JP-5 Tank Fueling System.

CHALLENGES:  NAS Whidbey Island is located outside the large metropolitan areas of Seattle and Everett Washington by approximately 60 to 90 miles.   Due to phased construction requirements (e.g., new facilities must be built, commissioned and the stored fuel transferred to the new facility before the decommissioning work can start), a lengthy construction period is anticipated.  Demolition of the existing Fuels Operations Building and other ancillary buildings may involve some asbestos and lead abatement work.

3. SITE ANALYSIS.  The project is located at Naval Air Station (NAS) Whidbey Island, Oak Harbor, Washington.  The new facility site will be located in undeveloped property adjacent to a fuel tanker parking area.  The area will require pre-loading of the existing soils over approximately half the project site due to varying subsurface conditions.  

4.  The Government will award one Firm-Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible, responsive proposer whose proposal conforms to the solicitation considered to be the ?best value? to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Proposers will be evaluated on:  Factor I:  Relevant Experience; Factor II:  Past Performance & Safety; Factor III:  Logistics Plan and Management Approach; and Factor IV:  Price.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiated with any or all proposers; use of tradeoff processes when it may be in the best interest of the Government; to consider award to other than the lowest priced proposers or other than the highest technically rated proposer; and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  Proposers should be advised THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  

The solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil, upon issuance.  Prospective Offerors must and should immediately register themselves on the web site.  Amendments will be posted on the ESOL web site.

Finally, Carleton Technologies will provide Operators and Maintenance training sufficient to provide the necessary information, skill development, and practical application required by the student to set up, check out, operate and perform preventative maintenance on the UUBA.   These UUBAs are being refurbished and reconfigured for delivery to the fleet.  This procurement also includes options to assemble, deliver, and support up to fifty-one (51) new UUBAs, and thirty-six (36) new NUBAs.  A NUBA is defined as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) MK 16 UBA with an upgrade kit installed.  The MK 16 is an analog, electronically controlled, fully closed circuit, mixed gas, constant par!  tial pressure breathing apparatus used by NSW during clandestine missi ons.  The upgrade will modernize the electronics to a digital system, increasing reliability while reducing dive setup time and cost.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Carleton Technologies is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the MK 16 UBA.  As the OEM, only Carleton Technologies can accurately perform all of the refurbishments and upgrades to the MK 16 to successfully transition the system to UUBA and NUBA respectively.  The Mk16 is a certified life support system.  As such, only approved components can be used on the system.  In summary, Carleton Technologies is the only responsible source due to their unique qualifications as sole manufacturer of the MK16 UBA.  Use of another company to refurbish and reconfigure the currently fielded UBAs would result in extensive re-qualification and certification testing which is cost and time prohibitive. Award will be made based on responsible proposal, on or about 30 Jun 07. Delivery will be mad!  e to NSWC PC. NAICS Code: 541990, Size Standard: 500 employees, PSC Code: 4220

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center , Division Newport, RI., (NUWCDIVNPT) has been tasked to lead the installation of submarine cables from sea-to-shore in San Clemente Island, CA to refurbish the capabilities of an existing undersea cabled system, Southern California Anti-Submarine Warfare Range (SOAR).  NUWCDIVNPT has also been tasked to do the same in Kauai, HI for the Barking Sands Underwater Range Expansion (BSURE) range at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF).  The cable route planning efforts to be conducted are highly dependent upon subsurface conditions.  Existing bathymetric data sets do not offer the required resolution or are missing data in areas crucial to the cable route planning efforts.  The determination of the water depth on the range will allow for the safe and accurate deployment of the submarine cables.  The determination of the water depth within and near the SOAR boundary and the BSURE boundary will require the collection of Multibeam hydrographic data.  The contractor shall conduct a Multibeam hydrographic survey in the deep waters located within and adjacent to the SOAR boundary.  As an option, the contractor shall conduct a Multibeam hydrographic survey in deep water located within and adjacent to the BSURE boundary.  The specific locations of the survey will be provided in the Request for Proposal.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee Completion type contract is anticipated.  Award will be based on Best Value with Technical Capability and Past Performance being the evaluation factors.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.

In reaching its decision OPP assesses potential risks of pesticide use, estimates the benefits of pesticide use, develops criteria and standards for regulation and record both its regulatory conclusions and their rationale.   In performing these duties the Office of Pesticide Programs receives numerous technical documents, studies, chemical descriptions, and product labels from pesticide firms and other sources, as well as generate substantial amounts of information about the regulatory decisions of OPP.  The receipt and subsequent retaining of all information used in the decision making process must be easily accessible for review.  Therefore, OPP has a requirement to produce images of study documents, pesticide products administrative documents (registration jackets), and pesticide product labels on CD; this requires conversion of paper documents to electronic documents for retrieval and retention.  The requirement also includes the destruction of hard copy study documentation through a secure facility and the operations of the Information Service Center.   The work is performed on-site at 2777 S. Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA. This is the pre-solicitation notice for this requirement. The draft statement of work and the FIFRCA security manual are posted at EPA's website http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adp_placement/10593/index.htm.

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY 07 should be submitted by 20 Feb 07; FY 08 by 01 Nov 07; FY 09 by 01 Nov 08, FY 10 by 01 Nov 09.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 September 2010, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details. 

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to support the development and operation of information management technology in accordance with AFRL Information Management technology goals. 

Information management (IM) is defined as a set of intentional activities to maximize the value of information to support the objectives of the military enterprise.  The quantum of managed information, referred to as a Managed Information Object (MIO), is comprised of a payload (e.g., document, imagery, or movie clip) and metadata that characterizes the payload context (e.g., topic, time, and location).  The MIO metadata is used in the information catalog that describes what information is currently available or may become available. An important factor that drives the effectiveness of the information management services is the degree to which the metadata describes the information available.  

The layers of services that form the information management infrastructure empowers an information space wherein information is managed directly, rather than delegating all information management responsibilities to applications that produce and consume information.  The information space is a collection of information catalogues and repositories that form the heart of an IM infrastructure.  Actors interact with one another indirectly through the information space and the layers of services that manage the information within the information space.  

There are four different types of actors interacting with the information infrastructure who are known as producers, consumers, federates, and managers. Producers are information space clients that add information to the information space that will reside in the persistent or transient information repositories.  Consumers are information space clients that requests and utilize the information within the information space based on client provided search or subscription criteria.  Managers are responsible for the policies, resource management, and maintenance services and processes that enable the information space to process information demands in a secure, timely, and reliable manner. Federates are other information spaces that virtually extend the contents of an information space by appropriately sharing information among the federate members.  The services and mechanisms that will enable the creation and operation of a federation is the focus of this BAA.  

A single universal information space is unlikely to be achieved in any sufficiently complex military endeavor and it will be necessary to have multiple information spaces where clients will need to reach across them to get information they require.  The desire is to have the spaces themselves connect to form a federation that allows one information space to be 'extended' by the contents of another.  The advantage provided by this class of federation is providing consumers a "single" information space.  Producers merely share information with its 'native' information space and the federation services ensure that it is shared appropriately with other spaces.  Having the spaces interact directly will require agreements between the respective information spaces that encompass trust management, confidentiality and integrity management, policy mediation, content filtering, information replication, and pass-through processing.

The concept of a shared information space is central to the AFRL Information Management vision.  Understanding how concepts for federating information across multiple information spaces and the technologies that can be applied in the unique military operational and tactical domains are of critical importance.  These information spaces will be organized and based on multiple factors such as geographic regions, functional requirements, organizational boundaries, and network topology/infrastructure.  The necessary modes of interaction will require higher-level services where service agreements between the infospheres manage the interactions in a seamless and efficient manner.  These information services connect information spaces together for the purpose of providing a 'single virtual' information space.  It is anticipated that different federation services and techniques will be necessary when federating between highly connected federates (Ethernet), loosely connected federates (airborne environment), or federation between both environments.  Identifying and addressing deficiencies in technologies in this area will be essential to achieving the DoD vision of Net-Centric Operations (NCO). 

AFRL/IF has been conducting research in the areas of information dissemination and management approaches which have been focused on the creation of a single shared information space.  This research has lead to the development of multiple information dissemination and management infrastructures conforming to the Infospherics (www.infospherics.org) Common API. A reference implementation has been developed in accordance to the infospherics API that enables the creation of a shared information space. This reference implementation will be made available (executable and/or source code) to all successful offerors interested in using the system as a research vehicle for experimenting with the proposed approaches for federation.

Additional reference information: 

1. "Joint Battlespace Infosphere: Information Management within a C2 Enterprise" http://www.dodccrp.org/events/10th_ICCRTS/CD/papers/065.pdf

2. "A Reference Model for Information Management to Support Coalition Information Sharing Needs"  http://www.dodccrp.org/events/10th_ICCRTS/CD/papers/274.pdf

All white papers should address solutions based on the development of non-proprietary, modular components (including the delivery of source code) that will be capable of being integrated into existing or emerging IM infrastructures. 

The objective of this BAA is to solve the technical problem of federating information spaces.  Successful white papers/proposals will focus on developing the following mechanisms in the listed order of importance.   The initial focus should be on developing the mechanisms for inter-federate sharing, followed by mechanisms to facilitate security and service requirements, followed by mechanisms to manage and enforce operational requirements, and conclude with mechanisms to mediate inconsistent data standards.  Proposals may address highly connected or loosely connected federates or both.  Shorter duration efforts should concentrate on mechanisms for inter-federate sharing.  Longer duration efforts should address a specific approach that encompasses some or all of the multiple mechanisms discussed.  The technical issues listed below identify specific concerns, but should not be used to limit or constrain innovative ideas.  Further, sub-elements of the four listed technical areas should not be considered individually or as a subset to be sufficient in scope to warrant consideration as a whitepaper or a proposal.

1.  Connect information spaces together establishing a 'single virtual' information space. 

    a.  Methods for seamless information sharing across information boundaries to satisfy both client demand and information management efficiencies. 

    b.  Methods for performing information discovery across information spaces without prior knowledge of the existence of that information.

    c.  Efficient methods such as information discovery, content filtering, information replication and pass-through processing as appropriate for addressing highly connected and loosely connected federates.

    d.  Analysis and experimentation that will be performed to assess and validate the hypotheses behind the proposed architectural approach.

    e.  Methods for managing the lifecycle of the federation, addressing formation, adaptation, and dissolution.  

2.  Security mechanisms for trust, confidentiality, and integrity.

    a.  Distributed trust mechanisms between information spaces

    b.  Role and policy mappings for discretionary and mandatory access.

3.  Information service agreements and policy mediation that enables the negotiation and specification of: 

    a.  Information sharing and enforcement obligations across information spaces. 

    b.  Service requirements and obligations

4.  Mediation of inconsistent data standards across information spaces.

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4.2M.  Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start approximately the second quarter of FY 07.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 07-$800K; FY 08-$1.2M; FY 09-$1.2M; and FY10-$1M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 30 months with dollar amounts normally ranging between $50,000 to $350,000 per year.  There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, in which criteria (1) through (3) are of equal importance and criteria (4) is of lesser importance than criteria (1) through (3), will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit, (2) Soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and methods to assess and evaluate it, (3) Openness of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and extent of a modular non-proprietary component approach and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Also, consideration will be given to the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:

<DESC>Development and commercialization of Silicon Carbide (SiC) Static Induction Transistor (SIT) technology supporting the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye Airborne Early Warning/Command and Control Aircraft AN/APS-145 Radar Upgrade and other key DoD Radar and Communication Systems.  The estimated dollar value of the basic contract is $1,600,000.00, and is based on a 1 year program.

Next generation DOD system requirements call for high power amplifiers that can provide higher RF power output in a smaller footprint.  These new requirements are beyond the capability of present technology, but are well aligned with next generation SiC semiconductor technology.  Current operational requirements include high power over the operating frequency range 960-1215 MHz and broader bandwidths. Vertical device structures used by the Static Induction Transistor (SIT) allow for the design of chips which can achieve the high peak powers needed to support the system requirements over the bandwidths needed. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) are interested in the establishment of a merchant production capability for Silicon Carbide (SiC) Static Induction Transistors (SITs).  The objective at program's end is for SiC SITs to become commercially available in order to support E-2D Advanced Hawkeye production and other potential DoD systems. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  

Key technical requirements of this program shall include the following characteristics: 

(a)	Establishment and qualification of a viable materials supply chain that includes a minimum of two SiC substrate and SiC epitaxial sources to support SiC SIT production; 
(b)	Capability to design, fabricate and test SiC SITs; 
(c)	Device fabrication line capable of processing 100mm SiC substrates; 
(d)	ISO certified quality system; 
(e)	Expertise in all aspects of SiC device design, modeling and simulation, device fabrication, DC/RF testing, assembly and packaging; 
(f)	Capability to conduct full DC/RF temperature dependent reliability testing; 
(g)	Demonstration, qualification and production of SiC SITs capable of operating at 100V producing high pulsed power operation greater than 1000 watts at UHF frequencies and tailored for insertion into E-2D Advanced Hawkeye AN/APS-145 Radar; 
(h)	Demonstration of production capability to support long term production requirements for E-2D Advanced Hawkeye AN/APS-145 Radar SiC SIT Power Transistors through 2016. 
(i)	SiC SITs shall be fully qualified with Northrop-Grumman Electronic Systems to support AN/APS-145 production builds beginning in mid 2008.  

Interested parties must identify their interest and capability in writing, and document the specific qualifications and capabilities as noted above that are essential to meet the technical requirements.  In addition, interested parties must also document the following qualifications:

(j)	Experience - Provide an outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed, or any in-house research and development effort or similar type of work that is currently being performed.
(k)	Personnel - Provide the name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientist, engineering, and other technical personnel who could be assigned as a principal investigator and/or project officer.
(l)	Facilities - Provide availability and description of special facilities required to performed in the technical areas under consideration.  
(m)	Other Qualifications - Provide other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area of procurement, which would enhance the government's consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received from this announcement will serve as the primary purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Statements of Capabilities are due electronically to the Air Force no later than 6 February 2007, and shall be forwarded to the following address: Gary.Victor@wpafb.af.mil. Address contractual questions to Gary Victor, Contract Negotiator, via (937) 255-5435; direct technical questions to John Blevins, Program Manager, via (937) 255-9872.  Responses received after this due date or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis and will not be considered.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) intends modify contract PBGC01-CT-03-0667 with Morneau Sobeco of Montreal, QC, on an other than full and open competitive basis.  Morneau Sobeco is currently responsible for modifying their proprietary Parameter-Driven Benefit Calculation Software (Ariel) to meet the needs of PBGC, provide software on the modified application and assist PBGC in the initial production implementation.  The anticipated modification to the contract will provide for additional training required in order for PBGC to accurately integrate pension plans into the application.    

The specific Integrated Training includes:  (1) an Overview of Ariel Parameters and Data Structure, (2) a condensed version of course listed in (1) above, and (3)  Basic Integration.  

In view of the provider's familiarity with the complexities of the modifications to their propritary software required by PBGC, extensive systems experience with PBGC's environment, and the time already spent in providing specialized training under this contract, it is PBGC belief that it would be in our best interest for the current provider to develop the customized and proprietary training needed to integrate PBGC actuaries.  This is not a request for proposal.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for a competitive quote.

<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information.  This announcement IS NOT A DOWN-SELECT OR QUALIFICATION SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL of any kind.  The applicable NAICS is 611430: Professional Development Training. All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any costs incurred that are associated with any submissions received from industry in response to this Market Survey, including travel costs.  All costs associated with this Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense. ______________________________________________________________________ Amended 1/19/2007:  The FAA had intended to release a draft Statement of Objectives and related documents by January 16, 2007.  As the draft documents are still undergoing Agency review, the FAA is unable to release them at this time.  The FAA will release the draft documents as soon as possible. In order to continue the productive dialogue with potential vendors on the Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solution (ATCOTS) and to ensure that all potential vendors understand the human talent and capital resources currently utilized at the FAA's Academy, the FAA is inviting all interested vendors to a Visit Opportunity at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City, OK on Saturday, March 3, 2007.   Vendors must express their interest in attending and provide the names of the individuals and a point of contact that will be representing their organizations to the Contracting Officer, at joe.carey@faa.gov no later than noon on February 15, 2007. It should be noted that this will likely be the only remaining opportunity for potential ATCOTS vendors to view the Academy. Vendors may also submit questions regarding the Academy resources, as it relates to the ATCOTS acquisition, prior to the visit, but no later than noon on February 1, 2007.  These questions, as opposed to ATCOTS normal process of responding only to the vendor submitting the query, will be disseminated with their answers publicly, although with identification of the requester removed. Vendors are also encouraged to submit requests with their questions to see or learn about any particular aspects of the Academy including physical space, capital equipment, procedures, etc.  Although the FAA cannot guarantee to accommodate every request, an effort will be made to do so, if deemed legally permissible, especially for those items requested by multiple vendors. The ATCOTS program office had intended to release a draft Statement of Objectives and related documents for industry comment sometime this week.  As the draft documents are still undergoing Agency review, the program office is unable to release them at this time and is targeting January 16, 2007 as the release date.  At that time, the FAA also anticipates releasing information concerning an Industry Day in the Washington, D.C. area.

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  This market survey is being conducted to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among eligible socially and economically disadvantaged business (SEDB) that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement using other Small Business competitive procurement procedures.  The principal North American industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 611710 Educational Support Services with a size standard of  $6.5 million.  Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA SEDB 8(a) certification letter (if applicable).    This market survey concerns the draft Statement of Work for Development and Revision of Airman Knowledge Training Handbooks.

All responses shall include the following: 1)	Comments/questions on the draft statement of work 2)	Completion of the attached Business Declaration Form 3)	Information concerning contracts, which are considered relevant in demonstrating ability to perform the proposed effort for a government agency or private company.  At a minimum, the description shall include the information below for contracts performed within the past three years:  Project title, customer name, project start and end dates, project value, client point of contact information including email address and phone number, description of the work performed, description of why the work is relevant to the proposed effort. This market survey is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute an RFP or a promise to issue and RFP in the future.  If/when a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any resulting solicitation.  This market survey does not commit the Government to contract to for any supply or service whatsoever.  The  Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this market survey.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) For Army Training and Doctrine Development Configuration/Training and Doctrine Development Tool (TDDC/TDDT) 11 August 2006 Version 0.6
Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is soliciting information on ways to provide the Army with a Training Development Tool utilizing an existing database consisting of tasks and training support plans developed by individual Army service schools.  The Army requires the ability to conduct analysis, design, and development of Army training products that are deposited into a centralized database. The centralized database of training products is available for discovery and delivery to users anywhere in the world. The training products developed support all levels of Army training and the three domains of Army training (Unit, Institutional and Self-development).
PEO STRI would also like information on how this provided capability would be maintained and fit within the Armys overall Training Information Architecture.

HISTORY:  The US Army develops, maintains and delivers training and Army doctrine to soldiers, teams and units deployed world-wide.  Training information includes courses, lessons, individual Soldier Training Plans, Combined Arms Training Strategies, and more.  Development of these products is based on tasks, which allow for the sharing of information between different products as appropriate and required.

The US Army Training Support Center (ATSC) developed a contract which was awarded to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) in April 1999, to produce an integrated solution for Army training and doctrine development, storage and delivery based  on the Army Training Information Architecture Operational Architecture.  This contract delivered a list of Army training and doctrine requirements, an Army Training Information Architecture (ATIA), and integrated information systems (Army Training Information Architecture, Migrated, ATIA-M).  The ATIA-M is largely a series of web-based Java applications using an Oracle database.  The Training Doctrine Development Tool (TDDT), was developed in the NET framework to provide training and doctrine developers a standalone product development and maintenance capability.  The TDDT interacts with the server-based ATIA-M Training and Doctrine Development Configuration (TDDC) for information storage, discovery and sharing/reuse.

An  Oracle database, known as the Digital Library Data Repository (DLDR), was established to host the combination of about 26 individual Army service school training products.  The DLDR provides the ATIA-M common information source.  ATIA-M applications use the combined database for content development (TDDC/TDDT), storage (Digital Library Data Repository), discovery and delivery (Individual Training Configuration, ITC).  Training and doctrine developers currently use a combination of the Automated Systems Approach to Training (ASAT) that is connected with an individual Army service school database (Sybase) and MS Word which is used to periodically populate the DLDR.

TDDT and TDDC fail to meet requirements.  Functional testing of the TDDT application conducted in the spring of 2006 identified significant areas of needed functional improvement.  Subsequent performance testing of the TDDC also identified areas of needed performance improvement.  A copy of the functional testing after action report is provided at enclosure 6, copies of enhancement and change requests submitted as a result of functional testing are provided at enclosure 5.  A copy of the 14 July 2006 TDDC performance evaluation report is provided as enclosure 1.

As a point of reference, the Training and Doctrine Development Configuration Assessment for TRADOC, dated 14 July 2006, asserts that the underlying Enterprise Java Bean (EJB)-centric design is overly complex for the system requirements.  Generally, there are four conditions where use of EJB may be appropriate, and the requirements allocated to the Training and Doctrine Development Configuration fit none of these conditions.  Accordingly, it is prudent to consider other solutions, which may apply a more efficient design in terms of system performance, interoperability requirements notwithstanding.  The report also indicates potential issues with database design in terms of tables and indexes and usability in terms of work flow.

TDDT and TDDC have had limited collective task training development supporting Future Combat System (FCS) training in the past two (2) years.  Interfaces with other Army training information systems for retrieval of essential information are being developed with the ATIA-M data repository, to include: the Digital Training Management System (DTMS) for unit training management; and the Army Learning Management System (ALMS) for individual training management.  A copy of the ATIA-M/ALMS interface requirements specification is provided for reference at enclosure 7.  Future interfaces with the Training and Doctrine Development Management System (TD2) and Course Level Training Model (CLTM) are envisioned to support Department of the Army costing and resourcing requirements.  Other interfaces with doctrine repositories, the Army Training Requirements Reservation System (ATRRS), and more, are anticipated to be required.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this RFI is: to obtain information; assess industry capabilities; solicit industry comments/recommendations in order to provide a functionally and technically satisfactory Army training design and development capability; and to make a recommendation to the Army for an appropriate solution that considers suitability of the current solution, considers emerging technologies, information system interfaces and existing data repositories.  We anticipate three broad potential courses of action: fix current implementation; develop a hybrid solution of current implementation and new technology; and a new/replacement solution.  The proposed solution should address the following as a minimum:

	Describe how the proposed solution is consistent with the current ATIA-M, and how it differs from the current ATIA-M TDDT/TDDC implementation; provide advantages and disadvantages of your solution.
	Evaluate the ability of the proposed solution to integrate with the ATIA-M, based upon a minimum of level 1 interoperability as described in paragraph 5.1 of enclosure 2
	Achieve business processes and provide capability to allow users to develop and render individual and collective training products as data objects, as outlined in the ATIA Use Case documentation provided at enclosure 3.
	Training development requirements, and system performance requirements, provided at enclosure 4.
	An agile software development methodology that accommodates changing requirements; providing iterative development and testing in advance of final testing, that should include performance load testing.
	Implement a high-performing framework that is user friendly and functionally acceptable, and interacts with the established database of electronic Army training and doctrine products comprised of finished/published publications and task-based data objects that may be shared.
	Single sign on capabilities using the Army Knowledge Online (AKO) for user authentication.
	The capability for continuity of training developer workflow, regardless of network connectivity, without reliance on branch specific, or multiple standalone databases.
	Migration of Service school data into the ATIA-M centralized database in a way that avoids unwanted data duplication.
	Performance and functional testing of the proposed solution to ensure the optimal solution is available to the Government, and the proposed solution satisfies functional and performance requirements.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  Interested parties are requested to review the ATIA interoperability documentation, TDDC performance analysis, Change Request documentation and ATIA requirements.  Written responses are limited to 12 pages and should include a rough order of magnitude and projected schedule for work to be performed.  Specific review/input is requested in the following areas:

Administrative:

a.	Provide company name, points of contact with phone number.
b.	Every page should have the company name, header, page numbers, date and if applicable version number.

Technical:

a.  Current capabilities.  Describe the current capabilities of your company and how it could fulfill the requirements described above.  Provide examples of relevant, implemented applications to demonstrate capabilities as appropriate.

b.  Unique capabilities.  Describe any unique capabilities beyond that described above which could be applied to support the  development, sharing and maintenance of Army training products.

c.  Past performance.  Years of experience in requirements analysis; and developing and/or deploying information systems that support development, storage, discovery, sharing, maintenance, and delivery of training and/or doctrine products in such a way that the resultant products were not over-engineered, nor under-engineered.

Written response to this RFI should be provided by 1400 EST, Monday, 2 October 2006,  via electronic mail to Contract Specialist, Gloria Bailey at:  gloria.bailey1@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC-PC), Florida is seeking sources for manufacture of Personnel Transport Modules (PTMs) for testing and evaluation on the Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC).  The application is for use on US Navy hovercraft. The PTM is used by the Navy to deliver combat ready Marines from ship to shore aboard LCACs (Navy hovercraft).  The PTM is a modularized and multi-configurable hard structure designed to secure to the open cargo deck of LCAC in order to protect its occupants from the elements inherent in a hovercraft environment, including wind, noise, sea spray, blowing sand, dirt, debris, and hot exhaust gases.  The PTM is designed as a deployable pack-up kit, and stows aboard amphibious shipping in one 8 ft x 20 ft ISO container.  The assembled structure provides seating with lap belts, lighting, a forced ventilation system, and is capable of accepting litters for Medevac operations.  The structure consists primarily of lightweight panels incorporating sealing and attachment means at the edges, and all PTM parts are lightweight and portable to allow transport and assembly on the LCAC deck by hand only, without need of crane or forklift.  Seven production PTM units were delivered to the f!  leet in 1997, and have been used and deployed continuously in various operations ever since. The Navy seeks full-up deployable PTM prototypes of alternate designs for testing and evaluation, in order to help determine design performance requirements for a future production procurement of PTM units in order to replace the aging PTMs of the current design.  The designs should offer a substantial improvement over the current PTM design, especially in the areas of assembly, sealing, corrosion-resistance and durability, noise attenuation, and ventilation.  Only prototype designs that have actually been fabricated and tested on LCAC or similar hovercraft/ air cushion vehicles will be considered.     This announcement will serve as a first step for evaluating alternatives and supporting In-Service Engineering Agent  (ISEA) research and development efforts.  PTMs prototypes could be acquired for test and evaluation purposes, in order to evaluate potential design changes and improvements compared to the current PTMs already in service with the US Navy.  Responses to this announcement should include a technical description and characteristics of the PTM design to be produced, and should document any previous testing accomplished on LCAC or other hovercraft.  They should also include estimated system procurement costs.  Descriptions should have enough information for the government to make informed decisions.  Information submitted shall be marked with restrictive legends as deemed appropriate by the potential offeror. Data with restrictive markings will be handled in accordance with the restrictions thereto. Interested firms shall respond with brief documentation showing the companys ability to fulfill the requirements described above.  Only prime contractors should respond.  A list of responding prime contractors will be furnished to potential sub-contractors upon request. The point of contact for this action is Mr. John Ducote, NSWC PC, Code: E32, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL 32407-7001, or email: john.ducote@navy.mil.  Responses to this sources sought should be sent to Mr. John Ducote at the address stated above, not later than March 7, 2007. This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the announcement will be published on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO), Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), and NSWC-PC Internet.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE

PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICE

This is a Request for Information ONLY.  No award will be made as a result of this submission.
As used herein, Provider refers to the entity that performs the psychological assessments and Contractor refers to the prime Civilian Police (CIVPOL) contractors.

BACKGROUND

The Department of State (DOS), through the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs? Office of Civilian Policing and Rule of Law (INL/CIV), has responsibility for international civilian policing programs.  INL/CIV currently works with three contactors ? Dyncorp International (DI), Civilian Police International (CPI), and Pacific Architects and Engineers-Homeland Security Corp. (PA&E-HSC) ? to recruit, train, equip, deploy and support U.S. law enforcement officers (current or retired or separated from service within 5 years) to serve as civilian police (CIVPOL) in international peacekeeping missions.  Most CIVPOL programs are sponsored by the United Nations (UN), but they are also sponsored by regional security organizations such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) or by coalitions of interested countries.  The U.S. currently has more than 1,200 total CIVPOL participating in missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan and East Timor.  
CIVPOL responsibilities vary by mission.  They may be in uniform, armed and have executive authority; serve as trainers and/or mentors; act as monitors or some combination thereof.  

INL/CIV also provides criminal justice and corrections experts and advisors to some of these locations through the same three contractors.

Living and working conditions vary.  In many instances, individuals will face rudimentary infrastructure, including a lack of the most basic items such as potable water.  While each mission is unique, officers may be required to be armed with a service handgun (9mm) and automatic rifle (5.56mm).  They serve in localities with political and civil unrest, and, as in Iraq and Afghanistan, with on-going insurgent hostilities.  In some missions, security threats may restrict freedom of movement or require officers to live on locked-down compounds and travel in armed convoys.  CIVPOL personnel must be capable of working long days for long periods of time.  These are unaccompanied assignments, so there is the added stress of being away from family and friends in an environment that may make communication difficult and sporadic.  

Currently, each of the three companies on contract with INL/CIV is responsible for the psychological testing, assessment and evaluation of applicants to programs for which they have the respective task orders.  Applicants for the CIVPOL program are pre-screened prior to arriving at a central selection and training site, and then undergo further screening at the training site.  Psychological evaluations are performed during both phases of the selection process.  The common practice is to sub-contract that work.    

INL/CIV seeks, through this request for information, to gauge the interest of potential providers of psychological services if there were a requirement for all three CIVPOL contractors to utilize one provider to perform psychological testing, assessment and evaluation of all applicants to all programs.  

REQUIREMENTS:

There shall be three separate and distinct components to this request for information, and responses shall address each component separately.

COMPONENT 1

The Provider would provide psychological testing, assessment and evaluation services to screen CIVPOL applicants prior to their employment with one of the contractors.  Such testing, assessment and evaluation shall determine the applicant?s suitability and adaptability for civilian police work overseas under conditions such as those described above.  Psychologists performing the evaluations would determine the psychological suitability of an individual for deployment on a CIVPOL mission and so advise the contractor and INL.  The provider would have to be prepared to defend that determination if so requested by the contractor or INL.  The provider would also make a determination, based upon professional expertise and customary and accepted standards as to the period of time which must elapse before an individual deemed unsuitable is eligible to reapply.  Specific areas that would need to be assessed as part of the evaluation include propensity for violence, safety awareness, integrity, substance abuse, attitude toward supervision, cultural sensitivity, judgment, problem-solving ability, adaptability/personality, stress management and risk avoidance.  This listing is not intended to be exhaustive, but is instructive.   A written assessment would need to be conducted and completed (this could be conducted on-line), and a preliminary evaluation made, prior to an applicant being invited by the respective contractors to participate in final pre-deployment selection and training.   Each candidate would also receive a face-to-face evaluation with a psychologist at the training site.  The psychologist doing the face-to-face evaluation would be provided with a copy of the written evaluation prior to meeting with the applicant.  The provider would prepare and maintain a written report on each applicant.

Provider would work with the three CIVPOL contractors, DI, CPI and PA&E-HSC, to provide appropriate individuals with written test instruments in a timely manner that allows time for the applicant to complete and return the test(s) and for the test(s) to be scored no later than 2 weeks prior to the scheduled start of the pre-deployment training.  Firms responding to the RFI should make recommendations as to the testing instrument(s) which should be used, with an explanation of the benefits of such instruments for this population and purposes.  Provider would be responsible for the scoring of the written instruments and would coordinate with the appropriate Contractor to ensure that all applicants attending the pre-deployment selection and training have satisfactorily passed the written testing, assessment and evaluation prior to such attendance.  Firms responding to the RFI must be able to demonstrate the ability to process up to 600 written instruments per month.  Provider would work with the appropriate Contractor on any other matters necessary to fulfill the contract requirements.

Firms responding to the RFI must be able to demonstrate the ability to perform up to 200 face-to-face psychological interviews during a 2-5 day period, up to twice a month.  Such interviews would be conducted at the pre-deployment selection and training sites, currently located in Leesburg, VA and Fredericksburg, VA.  Suitable office space for the interviews would be provided at the training site by the Contractor.  Such office space would need to allow for confidential interviews and be sufficiently furnished with chairs and desks to enable the performance of administrative functions necessary in conjunction with the interviews.  Electrical outlets capable of supporting a computer would be provided in each interview room, but computers would not be provided.  Provider would have access to the office space used by the Department for telephones, fax and high-speed internet connections.  Provider would be consulted with respect to scheduling of such interviews, but would not have control over the scheduling.  Provider would receive a minimum of four weeks advance notice of the scheduled interview dates.  

Firms responding to the RFI must be able to demonstrate that psychologists who would be performing the testing, assessment and evaluation have a thorough understanding of and experience with the candidate population (law enforcement), the job environment (dangerous, multi-cultural, high stress) and the living conditions (third-world conditions, away from family and friends).  All psychologists must have experience in interpreting the written (on-line) assessments proposed to be used.  All psychologists must have and maintain a current license to practice psychology in Virginia.  

The Provider would be required to maintain records for a minimum of five years with respect to all persons to whom the written testing, assessment and evaluation instruments are sent, including those who do not pass the written instrument and those who do not return the written instrument for scoring, and provide that information in a timely manner to INL and the appropriate contractor.  The Provider would provide administrative and logistical services necessary to support the psychological testing, assessment and evaluation.  

The Provider would be required to consult with INL/CIV officers as appropriate and necessary to provide guidance on respecting operational environments and other parameters relevant to the selection of CIVPOL officers for missions.  Provider may be required to travel to mission areas in order to fully appreciate the conditions under which the subjects will be working.  

The Provider would be required to ensure that psychologists performing the testing, assessments and evaluations have appropriate and sufficient malpractice insurance, and abide by American Psychological Association confidentiality guidelines, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the relevant state psychology board regulations. 

CIVPOL programs fluctuate constantly.  It is impossible to accurately predict how many psychological instruments and interviews would be required during the contract period.  For purposes of responding to this request for information, potential providers are requested to propose the method by which they would price the requested services.  Responders are encouraged to propose more than one pricing method.   

Responses submitted pursuant to this request for information shall identify the written instrument(s) that will be used for the initial assessment and the experience that the prospective provider?s psychologists have in scoring and interpreting it/them.  

Prior to submitting responses to this request for information, potential providers may wish to consult with one or more of the Contractors to gain an understanding of the average failure rate and rate of non-return for the written psychological instrument.  The Contractors are PA&E, contact Phil Stewart at pstewart@paegroup.com; Dyncorp, contact Dick Cashon at richard.cashon@dyn-intl.com; and CPI, contact Rita Sartori at rita.sartori@civilianpolice.com.

COMPONENT 2

Provider would, upon request of INL/CIV, provide licensed psychologists to provide: 1) expert services to monitor and evaluate CIVPOL operating, working, living and social environments as they relate to individual and group psychological health and ability to perform effectively; and 2) psychological counseling as appropriate to CIVPOL officers in the aftermath of a traumatic incident in mission.  This may require travel to mission environments, travel to military or hospital facilities in third countries and/or domestic travel on short notice.  Multiple trips may be required with respect to the same incident.

Both group and individual counseling may be required, as determined by the psychologist.

Such counseling is not intended to be the sole mental and emotional health support for officers in the aftermath of such events.  Nor is it intended to support long-term therapy/counseling needs.  It is intended to: (1) provide an assessment as to the individual?s ability to remain in mission if the individual is physically able to do so and expresses a desire to do so; (2) provide an assessment as to whether the individual requires additional counseling and/or regular counseling in order to cope with the incident; (3) provide an assessment for INL/CIV as to any special needs that should be addressed, both with respect to individual officers and to the contingent as a whole.  The Provider would work with INL and the Contractor to determine and meet the needs identified in the assessments.  

Travel costs are typically cost-reimbursable items subject to limitations established in the Federal Travel Regulations.  Per-diem would be paid subject to maximums established for Federal travelers.  

COMPONENT 3

Provider would create and conduct a Post Critical Incident de-briefing workshop that could be offered multiple times a year.  The workshop would be offered to officers returning from missions and their immediate families.  No decision has yet been made whether participation in this workshop would be voluntary or mandatory.  The workshop, or a modified version thereof, would also be conducted after significant incidents in mission involving death, serious injury and/or significant trauma ? such offering may be in the mission or in a nearby country, rather than in the U.S.  The workshop offered on a more routine basis to officers returning from mission would be in the continental U.S., but would not have to be in the same location time after time.

Providers should propose an agenda for such a workshop, including the changes that would be made from the ?regular? workshop for one tailored to a specific significant incident in mission.  Valuable information would include the criteria that would be used to select instructors/facilitators/group leaders/counselors or others participating in conducting the workshop; how prior mission veterans might be utilized to assist with conducting the workshop and the criteria that would be used to select those officers and the training that would be offered to them; what role, if any, State Department program officers could serve in such a workshop; and any other relevant details.
 
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

Pricing and capability should be based on a one (1) year base period and two (2) one-year option periods.

DELIVERABLES

Providers should include the following deliverables when submitting their information:
1.	After each day of psychological interviews during a pre-deployment selection and training session, the assessment for each interviewee with respect to psychological suitability for deployment and a summary and explanation of the interview results;
2.	A quarterly report that details the total number of written instruments sent to applicants, the failure rates on the written instrument and the non-return rate of the written instruments
3.	Proof of valid, current psychology license and malpractice insurance for each psychologist performing services pursuant to this contract.  This shall include those psychologists evaluating the written instruments as well as those performing face-to-face interviews and counseling.
4.	In the case of post-incident counseling, a list of individuals counseled, and the psychologist?s assessment with respect to the individual?s ability to remain in mission if the individual is physically able to do so and expresses a desire to do so; whether the individual requires additional counseling and/or regular counseling in order to cope with the incident; and any special needs that should be addressed, both with respect to individual officers and to the contingent as a whole.
  
SUBMISSION INFORMATION DATE/TIME? Submissions are due on or before February 21, 2007 at 3:00 pm EST.  Proposal may be submitted to P.L. Diggs via email at diggspl@state.gov or via fax at 703-875-6006.

POINT OF CONTACT ? Questions concerning this requirement shall be addressed to P.L. Diggs in writing via email.

GENERAL  a.   Scalable multi-channel data acquisition system capable of window triggering from any of its inputs and capable of accommodating from 30 to 40 channels. b.  IRIG-B time synchronization capability. c.  Automatic trigger/record/re-arm sequence. d.  Capability to record in segmented memory mode. e.  Remote status/setup/configuration capabilities including capability to download waveforms remotely through Ethernet, check status, and reconfigure the system. 2.  TRIGGERING a.  Any input channel may trigger the acquisition (in case of multiple transient recorders, only the transient recorder(s) where transients are occurring is(are) required to trigger). b.  OR window triggering.  Each chassis/scope has to trigger anytime of the signals being monitored leaves a predefined window.  Windows are defined by high and low threshold levels.  Windows for different channels on the same chassis/scope may be different. c.  Segmented memory should allow for 10ms-20ms time segments with zero dead time between subsequent segments. d.  System capable of recording up to 40 segments within two(2) seconds.  No dead time between acquisitions. e.  Capability to automatically skew the channels to compensate for different cable lengths. f.  Pre-trigger capability of 20 to 50% of the segment. 3.  ISOLATION a.  Fiber optic links are required to bring signals from the field to the transient recorders inside instrumentation room(s).  Fiber optic links will be required to transmit signals through different single mode fiber lengths, with the maximum cable run of about 1000 meters through at least two fiber optic bulkhead connectors. b.  Close-loop verification capabilities to allow end-to-end channel tests through the network. c.  Fiber optic transmitters will be out on the field next to the sensors and subject to environmental requirements:  estimated operating temperature from 0 to 70C and vibration similar to Shuttle launch environment.  d.  Fiber optic receivers will reside in instrumentation rooms where vibration requirements may be less stringent and the temperature will be controlled. 4.  SAMPLING   a.  Two types of measurements are expected, for which two sampling rates will be used: 20 to 25 Mega samples per second and 100 Mega samples per second, with analog bandwidths of 5MHz and 25MHz, respectively. b.  Digitizers should have built-in anti-aliasing filters, whether they reside in the fiber optic transmitter or in the transient recorder. 5.  DATA STORAGE a.  Transient recorders should be capable to store at least 80 segments locally. 6.  MISCELLANEOUS a.

<SUBJECT>Y -- Request for Proposals for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Vandenberg AFB CA
<DESC>FPS Advisory Group, LLC (FPS), acting on behalf of the Air Force Program Office-San Antonio, and the Headquarters Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), anticipates the release of its Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Privatization of Military Family Housing for the Vandenberg Air Force Base project on or about 02 February 2007.  FPS intends to employ a one-step RFP process. In their proposals, each prospective Offeror (or Offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references and access to financial resources, financial strategy as well as a description of its technical approach to the Vandenberg AFB project as described in the RFP.  FPS will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Highest Ranking Offeror (HRO) to the Air Force.   The HRO will then begin negotiations with the Air Force and complete additional remaining submittal requirements needed for closing the real estate transaction. These additional submittal requirements are also identified in the RFP.  The project involves a real estate transaction to privatize all of the military family housing for Vandenberg AFB. The Government will lease land and convey 1,336 existing housing units and other improvements by fee ownership to the Successful Offeror. The Successful Offeror will; demolish 633 units (including 132 Excess Units), renovate 703 units and construct 164 new units.  Included in the units conveyed are 835 MILCON units constructed between 1995 and 2002. 132 of the MILCON units are in excess of the HRMA demographics requirements.  Offerors may elect to designate as many as 132 of these units as Excess Units and continue to own, operate, and manage them after the expiration of the six-year Initial Development Period subject to the requirements and restrictions contained in the RFP.  The Successful Offeror will finance, plan, design and construct improvements, as well as own and operate the rental housing development for military families for 50 years.  The Government's goal is to provide military families access to safe, secure, quality, affordable, well-maintained housing in a community where they will choose to live.   An Industry Forum was conducted on January 4, 2007 at the Pacific Coast Club at Vandenberg AFB.  The Industry Forum slide presentation, attendance list and the Statement of Need are currently posted on the project web site; http://projects.pirnie.com/vandenberg%5Fmhp/sitevisit.cfm.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Information Exploitation Office (IXO), announces a Briefing to Industry (BTI) associated with the intended release of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 07-13, the Urban Reasoning and Geospatial Exploitation Technology (URGENT) Program.  The purpose of the BTI is to outline the URGENT Program technical goals and problems to potential Proposers.  All presented materials will be made available via Internet when the BAA 07-13 is published, along with a FAQ including all questions and answers.

The BTI is scheduled for Thursday, 1 February 2007, and will be held in Arlington, VA, from 8:30 AM to 2:00 PM.  Detailed information about the BTI may be found at: http://www.schafertmd.com/URGENT2007.  A no-cost, pre-registration for the BAA 07-13 BTI is required.  A list of attendees, including name, organization, phone number, and (optionally) specific teaming interest will be posted at that URL.  The deadline for the BTI pre-registration is 25 January 2007.  The full BAA 07-13 solicitation is anticipated to be released on or about 24 January 2007 through FedBizOpps.  Attendance is not required to propose to the BAA 07-13. Similarly, attendance will have no direct bearing on proposal evaluations.

The URGENT program will develop techniques for the rapid exploitation of EO and LIDAR sensor data at the city scale (100s square kilometers) to recognize urban objects down to the soldier scale (<1 cubic meters).  URGENT will apply image processing technology to geospatially registered 2D/3D data collected from airborne and terrestrial sources, yielding precise annotations for the objects in an urban area.  Traditional pattern recognition systems, biologically inspired computer vision technology, and machine learning algorithms are among the approaches of interest to the URGENT program.  The URGENT goal is to achieve a 100x increase in analyst productivity with equal or better accuracy compared to the unassisted human image analyst.

<DESC>PROJECT TITLE:  Broad Agency Announcement for FHWA Exploratory Advanced Research Program.

SUPPLEMENTAL DOCUMENTS: All interested offerors must read this BAA in conjnction with the supplemental Proposer Information Packet (PIP) posted at:  
http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/crt/initiatives/pip.cfm .

NEXT EVENT: Request for Pre-Proposals (DUE 2/28/07).

The information on this page is non-binding and is presented in the interest of providing the vendor community in general, and potential offerors with a greater understanding of the intent of this procurement.  Your inputs and comments are solicited and we welcome the opportunity to respond.  All relevant information affecting this procurement will be posted to this web page and updated regularly.  Interested parties are reminded that only the solicitation document is binding with respect to government requirements.  TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT: Dr. Steven B. Chase, (202)493-3038; steve.chase@dot.gov. SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT DATES: This BAA is open for one year from the date of the FedBizOps announcement (through January 18, 2008). While pre-proposals may be submitted at any time during the open period of this BAA, those proposers who wish to be considered for FY2007 funding MUST submit proposals via email by not later than February 28, 2007. See further instructions below. OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is soliciting for proposals under its Exploratory Advanced Research Program (EARP) for research and development projects that could lead to transformational changes and truly revolutionary advances in highway engineering and intermodal surface transportation in the United States. The objective of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to stimulate research and development in high risk, high payoff projects that address technology and knowledge gaps. FHWA is especially interested in building upon, adapting or otherwise leveraging and utilizing the research and development investments made by other Federal exploratory advanced research programs such as those of the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.     PROGRAM SCOPE: The program scope is intentionally ambitious and broad to address the wide spectrum of topics and objectives that the funded investigations will strategically support. Advanced research in a wide spectrum of science and technology areas is intended. All research is intended to have the common objective of addressing the technology and knowledge gaps described below. This program is intended to spur innovation and focus on high risk and high pay-off research and development projects.  Incremental advances and demonstrations or evaluations of existing technologies are not within the scope of this program.     The following focus areas are of particular strategic interest and relevance to the FHWA and proposals in all of these areas are highly encouraged. This guidance is offered to help Offerors in the development of proposals of particular interest to FHWA including: Highway Safety; Dramatic Breakthroughs in Planning and Environment; Innovative Solutions to Understanding and Applying  Transportation Policy; Innovative Solutions to Reduce Traffic Congestion; Innovative Infrastructure Solutions; Cross-cutting Exploratory Advanced Research.     The following sections provide amplification of each focus area (see also further detail in the PIP). These are not intended to be all inclusive, and all creative and innovative ideas and solutions will be considered.

HIGHWAY SAFETY:  

Over 43,000 people die on America's roadway every year and almost 3 million are injured.  The US DOT, States, localities and the private sector are all working to dramatically improve safety and reduce the numbers of fatalities and injuries by 20 percent by the end of 2008.  The ability to reach this goal has been constrained by a number of factors.  Current research and development programs at FWHA and other US Department of Transportation (DOT) agencies are directed at short-term safety improvement initiatives, as well as longer-term research, especially into Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) solutions.  Major research into the understanding of crashes, especially from the integrated perspective of the driver, vehicle, and infrastructure is underway as part of the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) II at the National Academy of Sciences/Transportation Research Board.  Exploratory advanced safety research proposals that would supplement and complement these existing research programs are sought.  Proposals dealing with the following areas are highly encouraged.

1. Enhanced understanding of the importance of the visibility of the roadway.  This could include improved understanding of various levels of roadway lighting, as well as minimum levels of sign and pavement markings visibility to the driver, both at night or daytime.  
2. Innovative technologies to detect the presence of pedestrians or other vulnerable road users either at designated/typical crossing locations, or at mid-block/unexpected areas; determine the potential conflict of the user and a highway vehicle; and development of methods to warn the parties in time to avoid a crash.
3. In concert with the States, vehicle manufactures and other in the private sector, create the parameters for a long-term ground traffic control system that would individually monitor all drivers and vehicles, their roadways, and environmental conditions; assess the likelihood of a crash or vehicle conflict on a real-time basis; utilize a communications system to warn of potential conflicts; and eventually have the capacity to take control of vehicles in unsafe circumstances that could not be prevented, but for such assumption of vehicle control.
4. Enhanced understanding of the relationship between the vehicle (all types) and the roadway, especially with regards to maximizing the friction capacity between the vehicle and road surface to improve vehicle control.

PLANNING AND ENVIRONMENT: 

Future traffic, both passenger and freight, is predicted to increase and highways will need to accommodate this increase. More will have to be known about how to plan new highways to avoid, minimize and mitigate the environmental consequences of constructing these highways; and how to deal with the property acquisition and management issues associated with these highways.

Good planning relies upon good data. This includes data on traffic volume, speed, time of day and time of year variations, spatial distribution of population, employment and commercial activities and similar items. These data items are used to calibrate traffic models and forecast future traffic. Many of metropolitan areas use traffic models as a basis for producing long-range, i.e., 20+ years, transportation plans.  These traffic models require the data on current volumes, speed, etc. Obtaining this data is an expensive task, so much so that some areas use what is, in effect, simulated data. 

Other related data, e.g., accident data and pavement condition data are used, These data are used to develop medium range metropolitan programs for highway and transit projects expected to be implemented in, typically, 5 years. The pavement related data acquisition for this activity is sometimes a mixture of the reports of various agencies (e.g., states, cities, counties, villages, park districts) depending on which agency has maintenance responsibility for the road. 

Environmental analysis and assessment relies upon measurement and monitoring of levels of various species of chemical compounds (or in some cases elements) in the water, in the soil and in the air in the vicinity of current and planned highways.  The monitoring is done both preceding environmental documentation of a highway action and as part of ongoing system analysis. One important use of such data is to calibrate existing predictive methodologies. As with traffic, each of the species would have a concentration that varied by time of day and time of year. Existing monitoring typically is done by state and federal resource agencies (e.g. US EPA, state air quality agencies). The quality of the data thus obtained may be suboptimum or for many species (e.g., complex toxins), entirely absent.  

The needs identified above are based upon the assumption that existing trends will continue. It can also be reasonably assumed that the trend of increasing traffic with time (passenger, freight or both) might be reversed. There have been several short-term reversals of this trend in the past (less travel during gas rationing during World War II and during the two gasoline shortages in the 1970s). 

Proposals addressing the following needs are highly encouraged.

1. Improve the data collected, systemize the data for easier use, and reduce the cost of the data collection for both the 20+ year planning activity and the 5 year programming.
2. Improve both the environmental data collected and reduce the cost of environmental data collection.
3. Develop an early prediction system that would indicate the potential for a reversal in the trend of increasing traffic based on technological change.

TRANSPORTATION POLICY:

This focus area is to understand the complex socio-economic interdependencies of surface transportation systems and the policies that create, maintain and operate these systems.  This research is also intended to develop the ability to model, analyze and plan surface transportation solutions over different spatial and time scales.

The innovations expected to result from this advanced research program, if successful, should provide policy makers with forecasting tools that can be used to predict possible transportation outcomes based on financial decisions, condition and performance of the existing transportation system and future transportation trends.

Proposals are encouraged that explore the interdependent relationships between surface transportation systems, innovative financial mechanisms used to fund major infrastructure projects, advanced modeling systems and tools that could be used to analyze and predict future impacts of various transportation scenarios. 
Proposals addressing the following specific topics are also highly encouraged.

1. Analytical Approaches to Multimodal Investment Analysis
2. Emerging Issues in Innovative Finance
3. Alternative Futures to Freight Mobility
4. Integration of Transportation Data from Multiple Sources
5. Travel Demand Response to Travel Pricing
6. Geospatial Data Acquisition for Highway System Performance Monitoring
7. Advanced Approaches for Identifying Fuel Tax Evasion Practices

TRAFFIC CONGESTION: 

The Texas Transportation Institute has estimated that in 2003, traffic congestion nationwide cost the economy over $65 billion per year,  a figure that has more than doubled since 1993.  This figure would be even higher if it accounted for the significant cost of unreliability to drivers and businesses, the environmental impacts of idle-related auto emissions, or increased gasoline prices.  Major sources of congestion on the highway network include bottlenecks, incidents, adverse weather, poor signal timing and work zones.  Congestion caused by these sources is difficult to mitigate due to the lack of mechanisms to control traffic demands and prevent gridlock where capacity limitations exist. This inability to control demand is exacerbated by the fundamental economic fact that individual motorists' price for transportation service does not reflect the full cost of congestion from their use of the highway facilities. The focus of this research area is to identify, develop and assess innovations that have the potential to dramatically reduce traffic congestion through significant operational and technological improvements. These innovations, if successful, should provide considerable relief to drivers and significantly reduce the costs of congestion.  

Proposals that focus on congestion mitigation exploring longer-term, higher risk ideas with the potential for dramatic breakthroughs addressing the causes and consequences of traffic congestion are specifically encouraged. Proposals addressing the following specific topics are also highly encouraged.

1. Research that addresses the gaps in understanding and knowledge of Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) and that develop new mobility concepts, validate driver behavior and acceptance, and assess the feasibility and mobility benefits through simulation studies based upon VII.
2. Research to investigate the adaptation of state-of-the-practice of heuristic methods used to solve complex optimization problems in other domains, such as such as military science, computer science, and enterprise integration with the objective of applying these heuristic methods to the domain of intelligent transportation systems (ITS).
3. Innovative approaches to generate origin-destination (O-D) tables. Of particular interest is the possible identification and adaptation of algorithms and computational methods used in other domains in order to identify an estimation model that can provide highly accurate O-D table data in real-time.
4. Research to investigate if advanced materials can be developed and incorporated into pavements to support network radio communication services.  This communication innovation could reduce the costs of communication for traffic management and other public purposes. This technology could also enable new applications such as automated and pervasive system condition and performance monitoring that would not be possible otherwise.
5. Research in effective data fusion, data mining, and non-parametric approaches for assessing highway conditions and performance that will overcome the existing gaps in data quality. 

HIGHWAY INFRASTRUCTURE FOCUS AREA:
 
Much of the FHWA's R&D in the infrastructure arena is currently focused on delivering short-term products as identified by the Agency's partners and stakeholders. There is also a need for research that supports the development of the next generation of highway infrastructure, addressing such issues as quality performance data, improved materials and systems, improved fabrication and construction practices, and new decision-making tools and models.

Proposals addressing the following needs are highly encouraged.
1. FHWA is interested in innovative or alternative materials that have the potential to reduce or eliminate shortcomings of existing materials; may enable broader use of innovative pavement and structural elements which have not found wide use for economic reasons, despite superior technical performance, and which may encourage the development of entirely new types of structures and pavements.
2. Improved performance of pavements and structures can occur in part through improved quality control of materials and construction.  Several breakthrough technology innovations in real-time quality control have been incorporated over the years into automated concrete and hot mix asphalt plants.  There is both a need and the potential for more such real-time quality control innovations throughout all elements (mix transport, placement, lay down, consolidation, curing, etc.) of the construction process.  Developing and implementing the innovations should result in savings gained from a better performing, more cost-effective constructed product and the use of fewer quality control and quality assurance personnel to measure and monitor quality.
3. The design and analysis of pavements and structures needs to be based on fundamental engineering to enable the optimized use of resources and contracting methods.  Innovative technologies and advanced computing power should be applied to enhance the understanding of the relationships between materials and construction to performance and provide the ability to predict the expected performance of structures and pavements.
4. Develop innovative ideas, techniques and tools for the collection, integration, analysis and interpretation of infrastructure management system data for efficient management of infrastructure assets and effective communication with owners and stakeholders.

CROSS-CUTTING EXPLORATORY ADVANCED RESEARCH:

It is recognized that there might be research topics and ideas that while not specifically addressing the topics listed above, should be considered. There are also research topics that are more fundamental or enabling in character and as such cut across the focus areas identified above. In fact, although presented within a specific focus area, several of the ideas presented above do cut across focus areas. In keeping with the Congressional intent of the Exploratory Advanced Research Program, the Federal Highway Administration is interested in any proposals for longer-term, high risk research that could bring about dramatic breakthroughs for improving the durability, efficiency, environmental impact, productivity and safety (including bicycle and pedestrian safety) aspects of highways and intermodal transportation systems. In submitting proposal, the Offerors are reminded that the intent of this program is to fund applied research that, while high risk and perhaps long term, is undertaken with a specific problem or need in mind. Basic research is not within the scope of this program.

GENERAL PROPOSAL INFORMATION:  
Offerors are required to obtain the Proposer Information Package (PIP) for this EARP BAA, available at:  http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/crt/initiatives/pip.cfm   

The PIP provides a more reader-friendly version of the information contained in this BAA, and provides additional information and detail on the pre-proposal and full-proposal format requirements, the submission process, evaluation and funding processes, and other general information. Proposals not meeting the format described in this BAA and in the supplemental PIP may not be reviewed. 

All administrative correspondence or questions on this BAA should be directed to the following email address:  benjamin.zaslow@dot.gov 

The FHWA has budgeted approximately $20.0 million over the next 3 years to fund this research program. Proposals will be evaluated using a two-part process consisting of pre-proposals and full-proposals. Offerors whose pre-proposals are of interest to FHWA will be invited to submit full proposals. Offerors who have been notified by FHWA that their proposals are not of interest may also submit full proposals if they wish. Multiple awards, typically of 12 to 36 month duration, are anticipated. The size of individual awards is anticipated to vary from $100K for short term efforts to as high as $3M for longer term projects. The FHWA may select for award all, none, or a subset of the acceptable proposals to construct a balanced program meeting its needs. The number of awards, and their dollar value, will vary depending on the merit of proposals received and their potential to lead to transformational changes and truly revolutionary advances in highway engineering and intermodal surface transportation. The Federal share of the cost of a project or activity carried out under this program is limited by Section 5101(b) of SAFETEA-LU to 50 percent, unless otherwise determined by the Secretary of Transportation. Offerors should prepare proposals with a baseline period of performance of 12 months and, if needed, with one or two options each with a 12-month period of performance. The FHWA anticipates that proposals funded in FY2007 would have an approximate award date beginning in May 2007. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSION OF PRE-PROPOSALS:

OMBUDSMAN NOTICE - NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).    Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.    Informal forum with the Ombudsman.    Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University (USU) located on the National Naval Medical Campus in Bethesda, MD has a requirement for a protein microarray printer.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotes (RFQ) for a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items and  FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to monitor FedBizOpps for any amendments to the solicitation.  This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-15.  This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses and the applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 325414-Biological Product Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.  All quotes are due January 30, 2007 at 2:00 PM EST.  Quotes may be either e-mailed, micreenan@usuhs.mil, faxed, 301.295.1716, or mailed.  The Government requires the best commercial warranty offered.

Interested vendors are to provide a quote for a protein microarray printer containing the following minimum features:

Printing of high quality protein microarrays requires an enclosed, high throughput, high precision, pin-based robotic protein microarrayer to aspirate samples from at least 4 microwell plates and dispense small volumes onto at least 50 slides.  This high capacity limits lot-to-lot variability, resulting in greater reproducibility. It must be able to print from 96 and 384 well source plates and must be able to print from less than 10 microliters of printing solution to conserve costly/precious samples.  To ensure the integrity of the source material, it must also have the ability to cool the source plates at least 10 degrees Celsius below ambient while not effecting the temperature of the printing area.  It must also have automatic humidity control with the ability to set the humidity to a desired setting and have that level maintained within 1-2%.  To ensure precise, high speed printing, the system must have a Telechem pin-compatible print head, capable of handling 48 pins at a time.  The printer must also physically hold the slides in place to ensure reproducibility between print runs.  Finally, to reduce cross-contamination, the printer must be equipped with a high pressure pin washing mechanism.  To permit use in a wide array of printing applications, it should also have highly flexible, user-defined printing patterns (including replicate placement) and user-selectable wash protocols.

Vendors may provide quotes on a new or demo product.  If a vendor quotes a demo product they must include a narrative on how the product has been used and for how long the product has been a demo.  If a demo is quoted, applicable warranty coverage shall be detailed.

The available funding for this requirement is $38,000.00.

Award will be based on the following evaluation factors:

1.	Technical-Vendors are required to submit product literature focusing on, but not limited to the following areas: Source Plate Capacity, Slide Capacity, Source Plate Temperature Control, Humidity Control, Source Plate Flexibility, Low Volume Printing Capability, Print Head Capacity, Print Speed, Print Pattern Flexibility, Slide Positioning Mechanism and Pin Washing Procedure.  Vendors must also provide their warranty plan for the system quoted (new or demo).  Failure to provide any of the listed information will result in a non-responsive quote.

2.	Price-Vendors are required to submit a quote for the protein microarray printer, including applicable shipping or handling charges.  Quotes must be valid for 30 days after RFQ close date.


Vendors must also submit a completed copy of 52.212-3-Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.  Failure to do provide a completed copy of 52.212-3 will result in a non-responsive quote.

STATEMENT OF WORK
Emergency Call Management System

Background:

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) work place must prove a safe and secure environment for the staff, but this requires more than just guards and metal detectors.  Emergencies can occur in the work place requiring responses from outside organizations.  This requires an emergency call management system.  The system must be capable of support the FEMA HQ operations which include staff working in the Design Center, Patriot Plaza, Crystal City and other locations in the Washington, DC area.  This disbursement of personnel adds a new dimension to the emergency call system requirements.  The system must be able to identify the caller, provide the location, and route the call to the appropriate 911 centers to ensure the responsible emergency support staff is notified in a timely manner.

Services Required:

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) requires a 911 Call Emergency Management System that can support the requirements to identify the caller, determine the location, notify the responsible 911 call emergency responders, and provide the capability to accept changes as personnel move, are reassigned and change the emergency information for 911 calls.  The changes are required to route the calls to the appropriate personnel in multiple locations. Emergency 911 calls made from any FEMA location i.e. Design Center, Crystal City, Patriots Plaza, 999 E St. NW, and FEMA Headquarters will be directed to the security guards at that location, to the lobby guard desk at FEMA Headquarters, and to the appropriate 911 center. 

The call will prompt an audible alarm on the computer screen and identify the person, the phone number and location including building, floor, room or cubicle number where the call is originating from. If electronic format maps are available the location can be super imposed on the map if preferred by the Safety and Security Office. The call can be recorded while the guards are determining the nature of the emergency. If deemed necessary the call can be allowed by the guards to proceed automatically to the appropriate 911 call center. 

The emergency call management system will include the necessary hardware components, installation, PBX integration, populating the personnel database, building of the Optivity Telephony Manager (OTM) database, integration and implementing the OTM database into the HQ PBX, training 6 technicians, and providing maintenance and support for one 1 year from implementation.

The procurement will provide the The Resources Information Technology Program Office (RITPO) with mission critical soft ware maintenance Support. RITPO request this action from MKS Software Inc. for maintenance support for the Source Integrity Enterprise, Integrity Server, and Integrity manager software products in support of CCQAS.

Any company that believes that it can meet these requirements is invited to submit written notification to the Contract Specialist within 15 calendar days from the date of the publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficie nt detail to demonstrate the companys ability to meet the requirement.  Information may be sent by email to the Contract Specialist at: john.fitzsimmons@amedd.army.mil .  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, responses r eceived from responsible businesses prior to close of business on 2 Febuary 2007 will be evaluated.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source order.  See numbered Note 22. Justification and Approval For Other than Full and Open Competition Maintenance for Product Software Developed by MKS Software, Inc. 1.  Contracting Activity.  The requiring activity is the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), MHS RITPO, Falls Church, VA.  The contracting activity responsible for this action is the United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort D etrick, MD. 2. Description of Action.  Approval is being requested to procure by other than full and open competition a follow-on contract for MKS Software License Maintenance to support Central Credential Quality Assurance System (CCQAS) project. Purchase will be mad e with O&M dollars, $12,765.03 on a Firm Fixed Price arrangement.  The period of performance is 16 November 2006 to 15 November 2007.      3.  Description of Supplies or Services.  CCQAS is the Military Health Systems (MHS) Web-based credentialing, privileging, risk management, and adverse action system centrally managed at the Resources Information Technology Program Office (RITPO).  CCQAS tracks information for the Army, Air Force, and Navy Active Duty, Reserve, and Guard components, as well as civilian and contract providers employed within the direct care system.  CCQAS is available via the World Wide Web from any location, at any time, t o approved users.  The Military Health System (MHS) must track and maintain medical credentials for more 100,000 military and civilian health care providers spread across more than 700 Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs).  The MHS must effectively manage credential information to ensure rapid deployment of privileged health care providers during both peacetime and wartime.  CCQAS was implemented to enable the DoD to efficiently and effectively manage and share this information.  In order to provide the req uired TIER III Maintenance and Sustainment services for the CCQAS System, the TIER III Vendor requires this software license to: 	Access complete historical validation of all changes made to source code and documents on the MKS server located at DISA-SATX. 	Access MKS central repository for storage and retrieval of source code and documents. 	Protect against multiple developers simultaneously working on the same code and allowing branching or forking of the development thus aiding the team development effort. 	Track issues/change requests received by developers. 	Formalize workflow of issues as they pass through approval, code modification, testing and production. The product being purchased is the MKS Maintenance Software from MKS Software, Inc.  MKS is the original software manufacturer and is the only vendor capa ble of providing these software products and upgrades at the level of quality required by the Government. This is a software license and maintenance needed in continuing support of the CCQAS program.   4.  Authority Cited.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302.1, only one responsible source. 5.  Reason for Authority Cited.  The RITPO requires specific and unique skill levels, as well as a thorough working knowledge of the CCQAS applications configuration management and coding process.  MKS Software, Inc. is the sole developer and only source capable of providing the necessary license and maintenance for their software product. The nature of the requirements dictates that the contractor must utilize MKS Software, Inc. maintenance support to avoid negative impacts to the CCQAS configuration mana gement application.  6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition.  There is only one responsible source capable of providing required software and maintenance. 7.  Actions to Increase Competition.  For the reasons set forth in paragraph 5, USAMRAA has no plans at this time to compete future contracts for the types of supplies/services covered by this document.  If another potential source emerges, USAMRAA will as sess whether competition for future requirements is feasible.  8.  Market Survey.  A formal market survey was not conducted.  A market survey was not conducted for reasons stated in paragraph 5 above. There is only one responsible source capable of providing required software and maintenance to software developed by M KS Software, Inc. 9.  Interested Sources:  To date, no other sources have written to express an interest. 10.  Other facts:  N/A This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are b eing requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

<DESC>This modifies the previous combined Announcement/Solicitation in the following ways: 1)  After review, it seems our Solicitation title was mis-leading. Inquiries suggested that it was believed we were seeking a company to convert our entire radio systems.  We are NOT seeking a company to do that.  The third paragraph states, "Under this BPA, work will be performed to ASSIST with the conversion of IMR park radio systems . . . "  and then is followed by a fairly specific description of work.  Please note this distinction when responding. 2)  In Line Item #11, please note that the service monitor of the test equipment needed is NOT the Aeroflex #2390 but the #2975. 3) We are not seeking to purchase materials, specifically radios.  Please refer to our description of work.
