<DESC>The U.S. Army, Army Contracting Command - New Jersey, on behalf of the Product Director - Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (PD-TMDE), anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about January 27, 2014 for the Full Rate Production (FRP) of the Next Generation Automatic Test System (NGATS). The Government intends to solicit this requirement through full and open competition, resulting in the award of up to three (3) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts.  If multiple awards are made, the Government intends to down-select to one contractor after the first delivery order and in accordance with the evaluation criteria laid out in the RFP.  The contract will have a total period of performance of five (5) years, divided into five (5) one-year ordering periods. Along with the FFP procurement of the NGATS, a FFP engineering services line item will be included to permit technology insertion and/or system upgrades, if applicable, during the course of contract performance. The applicable NAICS code is 334515. <br>  <br> Description of Action: <br>  <br> The Next Generation Automatic Test System (NGATS) is the latest addition to the Integrated Family of Test Equipment (IFTE) developed and managed by the Product Director Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (PD TMDE).  NGATS is a reconfigurable, general-purpose, mobile, deployable, Automatic Test System (ATS) designed to provide off platform sustainment support to all Army weapon systems.  This flexible testing platform will provide diagnostic maintenance of Current and Future Force electronic systems and will standardize the Army's Automatic Test Equipment (ATE).  The NGATS tests Line Replaceable Units (LRU) and Shop Replaceable Units (SRU) isolating failures to the component level. <br>    <br> The contractor shall perform all tasks necessary to ensure the manufacture and delivery of the NGATS in accordance with the Statement of Work. These tasks include, but are not limited to: planning and scheduling production; procurement or production of components; conducting engineering assessments of test data, hardware and the production process as necessary to assure on-schedule production; selection of appropriate production processes to ensure the TDP requirements are attained; testing of components and assemblies for verification of requirements; qualification of suppliers; and monitoring of subcontractors. <br>  <br> The NGATS FRP TDP is restricted to: Distribution Level D. If a RFP is issued, interested parties shall submit an executed copy of the DD Form 2345 in order to obtain the NGATS TDP(s). Furthermore, in accordance with Part 122.1(a) of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), any person who engages in the United States in the business of either manufacturing or exporting defense articles or furnishing defense services is required to register with the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls unless an exemption to the registration requirement under the ITAR applies. Registration is primarily a means to provide the U.S. Government with necessary information on who is involved in certain manufacturing and exporting activities and does not confer any export rights or privileges. Registration is a precondition to the issuance of an export license or other approval under the ITAR. <br>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">TONGASS ADVISORY COMMITTEE MANAGEMENT AND FACILITATION</p>
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL IS SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASE ON OR BEFORE FEBRUARY 10, 2014 ON THE FEDBIZOPPS (FBO) WEBSITE. <br />THIS ACQUISITION IS NOT A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE; ANY RESPONSIBLE SOURCE MAY SUBMIT AN OFFER. ALL QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESS COMPANIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COST INCURRED BY THE RESPONDENT TO THIS NOTICE. THE NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM CODE (NAICS): 541611. THE CLASSIFICATION CODE: R-PROFESSIONAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, AND MANAGEMENT SUPPORT SERVICES. <br /><br />Project Description<br /><br />The Tongass National Forest Service (FS) under the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a single Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract to the offeror whose offer is best value to the Government based on price and evaluation factors. The period of performance is 12 months.<br /><br />This project requires meeting management and facilitation services to establish an advisory committee to provide the Forest Service with advice and recommendations for developing an ecologically, socially, and economically sustainable forest management strategy on the Tongass National Forest. Recommendations and advice may directly inform modification of the 2008 Tongass Land Management Plan. <br /><br />The 2008 Tongass Forest Plan Amendment (2008 Forest Plan) focused on five issues as directed by the Courts after years of litigation. None of these issues were young growth timber volume related but more focused on how the Forest Service estimated timber demand and accounted for resource impacts. As a result of the 2008 Forest Plan decision, nearly half of the existing young growth timber stands reside in Land Use Designations (LUDs) that do not allow for commercial timber harvest. These designations were made to address other resource needs (e.g., wildlife habitat, old growth conservation strategies, and visuals) while old growth timber was harvested in both the "roaded" and "unroaded" portions of the Tongass. <br /><br />The meeting management and facilitation service provider will work with a committee established under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) that will reflect a diverse group of stakeholders and provide an opportunity for public ownership and involvement in this process. The forest and the Alaska Region are committed to a transparent, inclusive, and collaborative path forward with clear timelines for action; establishing a FACA committee will help to meet that commitment.<br /><br />Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any documents related to this procurement. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FBO website for the release of the solicitation and amendments. Offerors must be active in SAM in accordance with FAR 52.204.10 unless you qualify under an exemption. DUNS, TIN, and CAGE CODES must be written on submitted proposal when due. Only electronic responses via email will be accepted. Facsimile responses and telephone inquiries will not be accepted. Submit all inquiries and documents to Ms. Smith, Contract Specialist, at sherilsmith@fs.fed.us.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Room 5NW55, 5th Floor, 34th &amp; Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104 to perform carbohydrate deficient transferrin analysis by affinity purification and nano-LC-orbitrap analysis to give high-resolution analysis of glycoprotein and corresponding N-glycan analysis changes for NHGRI.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency seeking fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope of Work:</span></p>
<p>Provide cutting edge methodology for untargeted detection of pathological changes in the lipid glycosylation, protein-glycosylation and metabolic profiles of plasma, urine, fibroblasts, and/or cultured fibroblast pellets from individuals with neurological disorders. The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) metabolic disease laboratory has developed a number of assays that are much more sensitive than previously available. The laboratory has also taken a lead in the development of assays that are untargeted and can also be used in any body fluid in order that they can be applied to populations with unknown disorders so that new biomarkers can be used to identify novel defects. This technology supports the research needs of the UDP to identify new and rare diseases.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Contractor shall provide the following</span></strong>:</p>
<p>&bull; Carbohydrate deficient transferrin analysis by affinity purification and nano-LC-orbitrap analysis. <br />&bull; Untargeted N-glycan analysis in plasma by MALDI-TOF.<br />&bull; Targeted N-glycan analysis of UDP samples that deviate from controls using nano-LC-orbitrap or QTOF.<br />&bull; O-glycan analysis in plasma by MALDI-TOF.<br />&bull; Targeted O-glycan analysis by QTOF for in depth analysis of O-glycan disorders.<br />&bull; Free oligosaccharide analysis in urine by MALDI-TOF with a follow-up by QTOF for in depth analysis.<br />&bull; Glycomics analysis in cultured fibroblasts from patients with abnormalities in blood and urine;<br />o N-glycan and O-glycan profiles of cell pellet will be measured by MALDI-TOF<br />o Oligosaccharides may be measured in the cell pellets and culture media.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Tasks</span></strong>:</p>
<p>1. The Contractor shall perform carbohydrate deficient transferrin analysis by affinity purification and nano-LC-orbitrap analysis to give high-resolution analysis of glycoprotein and corresponding N-glycan analysis changes.<br />2. The Contractor shall perform untargeted N-glycan analysis in UDP patient plasma samples by MALDI-TOF as an initial screen. Further in-depth analysis will be performed on samples containing deviations using an accurate mass analysis by nano-LC-orbitrap or QTOF.<br />3. The Contractor shall perform untargeted O-glycan analysis on plasma samples using MALDI-TOF and LC-MSMS initially, with follow-up mass analysis screening by QTOF for in-depth screening of O-glycan disorders.<br />4. The Contractor shall perform free oligosaccharide analysis in urine by MALDI-TOF and in-depth mass screening by QTOF in samples that show deviations from normal samples.<br />5. The Government will be contacted if any patient results need to be evaluated urgently for impact on caring for patients in the UDP.<br />6. The Contractor shall supply electronic copies of all reports appropriate for deposition in the UDP process management system and for exome sequence variant analysis.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Justification:</span></p>
<p>The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Metabolic Laboratory is a CLIA certified laboratory that analyzes approximately 10,000 samples a year for the measurement of targeted and untargeted biomarkers and that can lead to metabolic disease. Additionally, CHOP has been instrumental in working with NHGRI on phase 1 of providing methodology for untargeted detection of pathological changes in the lipid glycosylation, protein-glycosylation and metabolic profiles of cerebrospinal fluid from individuals with neurological disorders from Undiagnosed Disease Samples provided by NHGRI Undiagnosed Disease Program.</p>

The documents are limited distribution (Distribution D) and will not be made available unless approval is granted.  Interested contractors must be registered in SAM and the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to receive access.  Information about the JCP is located at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp.
  

The solicitation will be available for download on or about 17 May 2013.  Interested parties can download the solicitation from the two websites listed above, for no hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed.  Offers must be submitted in the format specified in the solicitation to be considered.  Submitting a bid from the NECO web site by clicking on the "Submit Bid" does not guarantee offers will be received by the proper person in the correct format.  Furthermore, each interested vendor shall monitor the FBO and NECO websites for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation.  Closing date will be on or about 17 June 2013.  When the solicitation is available, all responsible parties may submit a proposal for this procurement which will be considered by the Government.

<DESC><strong>Description(s):</strong><br /><br />Battelle Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle), Management and Operating Contractor of the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is requesting information from prospective Offerors with respect to PNNL's Unified Communications Management System.
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to collect information regarding available solutions/services along with vendor capabilities for initially managing and supporting PNNL's Microsoft Exchange based email infrastructure and users, and to potentially extend this support model into PNNL's emerging Microsoft Lync based Unified Communications environment.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Battelle does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI. Battelle anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal after final determination of specification and statement of work requirements.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has approximately 4,200 staff and is operated by Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division with a main campus located in Richland, Washington and satellite offices in Sequim and Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Battelle has undertaken an effort to migrate from a set of discrete services to a Unified Communications environment that provides a tightly integrated set of services including email, calendaring, instant messaging, voice, video conferencing / chat, presence awareness.  The capabilities are provided using Microsoft's Lync and Exchange capabilities. Battelle is contemplating a Request for Proposal for services with a commercial vendor that has greater depth and experience than the current capabilities at PNNL in implementing, supporting and managing these environments and the users.</p>
<p>Environment Overview<br />Email:<br />&bull;	Microsoft Exchange 2010 with approximately 7000 mailboxes supporting about 4200 users.<br />&bull;	The environment includes the Ironport gateways used for email SPAM filtering and quarantining.<br />&bull;	 A single Lyris list server is located in the primary data center<br />&bull;	The infrastructure is split between two data centers and will remain at the laboratory.<br />&bull;	Email is accessed primarily with Microsoft Outlook; however, other client applications such as Thunderbird from some Linux systems, Good for Enterprise, and native email client application support through ActiveSync are supported.<br />Unified Communications:<br />&bull;	Microsoft Lync providing instant messaging, presence awareness, video chat, video conferencing integrated with our Polycom based video conferencing rooms, enterprise voice services.  The Enterprise voice services are currently in the pilot phase.<br />&bull;	Cisco VoIP &amp; Aastra PBX systems currently provide voice services. <br />&bull;	Audiocodes gateways provide an interface between the PSTN, Aastra, Cisco and Lync systems.<br />&bull;	911 services are provided using the Amcom Telident System</p>
<p>Battelle is requesting information in support of the following two primary components of scope:<br />1.	The initial scope is to provide managed services for the laboratory's Microsoft Exchange email environment.  Specific components include the Exchange application, the servers that house the exchange environment, the Ironport email gateways, client configuration and user support. Calls to the PNNL service desk related to email will be directed to the provider for triage and resolution. <br />2.	The second component of scope involves providing managed services for the laboratory's Microsoft Lync Infrastructure and its users.  As with the email support scope the support for the unified communications services includes all aspects of the Lync infrastructure management and user support.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION:</strong><br />Potential respondents must be a US company and able to prove that it is not under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI).  Contractor personnel accessing Laboratory's systems must be eligible for a DOE security clearance (US citizens and able to pass a Federal background check).</p>
<p><strong>Information Requested:</strong><br />Information requested from potential Offerors is part of a market research effort to identify current solutions and services available that can address the below list of service elements.   Responses should detail separately the vendor's service management and delivery model to providing (1) email and (2) Unified Communications support services.  Responses are to be based on actual experience in providing these services to a similar sized or larger organization than PNNL.</p>
<p>1.	General description of the vendor's managed services offerings for Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Lync<br />2.	How the infrastructure and the quality of the user experience are monitored including descriptions of any tools that would need to be installed at the laboratory. For Lync, identify any capabilities to monitor and proactively alert on individual calls with poor quality.<br />3.	How vendor performance is measured, including key performance indicators, and vendor Service Level Agreements.<br />4.	The mechanisms and approaches used to ensure that there would be effective communication and reporting for the Laboratory including escalating issues.<br />5.	Internal change control, management and approval processes and how they would be integrated with the Laboratory.<br />6.	How end users would interact with the vendor and how the vendor integrates these functions with the Laboratory's Service Desk including the vendor's standard hours of operation.<br />7.	Processes for dealing with service requests, incidents and problems, including severity level definitions used by the vendor, and associate response and repair/restore times.<br />8.	How the vendor will maintain security (confidentiality, availability and Integrity). <br />9.	Processes and timeframes for the implementation of application updates and security patches.</p>
<p>Please provide the most detailed information available for each service element listed above. Lengthy or elaborate promotional or sales-oriented submittals are not desired.</p>
<p><strong>RFI PROCESS SYNOPSIS:</strong></p>
<p>Questions should be submitted in writing until 01/31/2014. Questions received along with the Battelle answers, will be provided in email to respondents who have acknowledged their interest in the RFI.</p>
<p>Submittals should bear a transmittal (cover) page which sets forth the following: company name, this RFI name, the due date, and the vendor's contact name, title, and contact information. All submittals in response to this RFI must be received on or before 02/07/2014 by email addressed to Kit Steichen McBurney, at Kit.McBurney@pnnl.gov.</p>

<DESC>The General Services Administration is requesting proposals from electric generation suppliers to provide electric power supply to Federal accounts in New York.  The electric requirements are behind ConEdison, National Grid, NYSE&amp;G, Orange and Rockland and Rochester Gas and Electric.  The Government has divided its electric requirement into eleven (11) pricing groups.  Pricing groups are primarily fixed priced groups with some groups on index pricing.  The successful offeror(s) will supply all electricity components for the respective pricing groups.  Deliveries will begin with the May 2014 meter read date for all accounts unless otherwise specified.   The contract terms will range from twelve (12) to thirty-six (36) months.  A six (6) month extension period is included in the contract. The approximate total annual electric requirement is 123,725 divided among the 11 pricing groups.   Some pricing groups have a renewable power content requirement.  The price offered for each fixed price pricing group will apply to all accounts in each pricing group and that price will remain fixed for the contract term.  Multiple awards will be considered.  Offerors are not required to offer pricing for all pricing groups.  All pricing groups are available on a full and open competition basis.  This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis.  The procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP) conducted in accordance with Part 12 (Commercial Item) of the FAR. This announcement constitutes the presolicitation notice and the synopsis. The Government intends to award a contract(s) to the offeror that offers the lowest evaluated price for each pricing group and meets the solicitation's technical requirements.

<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) seeks to lease the following space:</p>
<p>State: Arkansas<br />City: Little Rock<br />Delineated Area: Northern Boundary: Markham Street<br />Eastern Boundary: I-30<br />Southern Boundary: I-630<br />Western Boundary: Broadway St. <br />Minimum Sq.

<p>Full Term: 10<br />Firm Term: 5<br />Option Term: 0</p>
<p>Additional Requirements: The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Little Rock, AR, that will be expiring. Therefore, the General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking expressions of interest to determine if relocating to alternative space is economically advantageous to the Government. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, including the physical move and voice and data systems move, replication of tenant improvements, etc. Offered space must meet Government's security requirements per the terms of the Lease. <br /><br />Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease. A fully serviced lease is required. Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain. In no event shall the offeror enter into negotiations concerning this project with representatives of Federal Agencies other than the General Services Administration's Contracting Officer or their designee.</p>
<p>Expressions of interest must include name, address, and telephone number of the individual to be contacted, and evidence of authority to represent the owner. Also include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Building name and address and location of the available space within the building; and</p>
<p>&bull; Rentable Square Feet (RSF) available, and expected rental rate per RSF, fully serviced; and</p>
<p>&bull; ANSI/BOMA office area (ABOA) square feet to be offered and expected rental rate per ABOA square foot, fully serviced.</p>
<p>Indicate whether the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any; and</p>
<p>&bull; Date of space availability; and</p>
<p>&bull; Building ownership information; and</p>
<p>&bull; Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking, if any; and</p>
<p>&bull; Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building; and</p>
<p>&bull; List of building services provided.</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

The PIT Tags needed are glass-encapsulated electronic devices measuring approximately 12-12.5 mm long by 2.0- 2.1 mm in diameter.  The tag can be coded with one of 35 billion unique codes.  As the tagged fish migrates through the hydro system, it passes though electronic interrogation coils established at juvenile detection sites located at federal dams in the Columbia River Basin and other rivers, streams, adult ladders, etc.  Each PIT tag must provide the necessary readability, reliability, high performance standard, and unique codes designed for all detection devices in the Columbia River Basin.

<a href="mailto:heather.vogt@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following services under project number 660-336 entitled Parking Garage Expansion (2) at the Salt Lake City VA Medical Center, 500 Foothill Blvd., Salt Lake City, UT 84148.   THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330. 

The intended project design will allow vertical expansion to the existing parking garage to provide an additional 533 parking stalls to meet patient need.  The existing parking garage has been constructed to accommodate this expansion by providing structural and elevator capacity.  The project design will provide new construction expansion to the existing parking structure matching in design and structural characteristics to further the aesthetics/function.  The design will evaluate aesthetics of existing and future structure and incorporate improvements as needed.  The design is expected to incorporate signage (electronic signage is likely to be desired by VA) on outside of structure facing Foothill Blvd.  This project design will analyze the vehicle/pedestrian flow of the station and provide an appropriate resolution to improve patient access (i.e., new Foothill Blvd entrance(s), pedestrian bridges including pedestrian bridges to front entrance of VA, vehicular wayfinding, pedestrian wayfinding, and other access features).  The project design will complete the tie-in to the station's site utility systems loops.  The project design will provide a fully covered (roofed) expansion with solar energy features to enhance energy conservation.  The project design will address replacement and expansion of utility systems necessary to make the remodeled space energy efficient by current VA standards.  The project design will analyze vehicular/pedestrian approach(es) serving the station and provide appropriate resolution.  The project design will address security standards as appropriate and the need for a connection to Building 1 & Building 14 to accommodate staff and patient flow between project areas and hospital.  Snow removal and snow plowing considerations will be incorporated into design.

Currently the Salt Lake City VA's existing parking garage (denoted as Building 48 (abbreviated B.48)) serves the patients.  The project design will provide for displacement of these vehicles during the construction of the expansion of the parking garage.  The existing parking garage is protected by fire sprinklers and new construction will continue that protection.  Site utility systems loops exist within range of the project area.  Utility capacity levels vary depending on the utility.  

Design must incorporate emergency power to support ongoing utility operation due to function of this space.  AE is responsible for investigating all existing conditions including performing geotechnical surveys if necessary and locating and analyzing utilities including determining adequacy of utility capacity.  If utility capacity is determined insufficient for new construction, AE is responsible for incorporating all utility upgrades in design. 

If site is determined to require Storm Water Permit, the AE is to apply for Storm Water Permit through Utah Department of Environmental Quality (UDEQ) and maintain all Storm Water paperwork as required by permit as well as perform checks of construction for compliance with permit through duration of construction as part of construction period services.  If solicited this should be delineated as a separate line item.

The Veterans Affairs Engineering Dept. will hire a third party (outside the AE firm) life safety review for this design and the AE must submit documents to this third party reviewer and answer questions and revise design to the satisfaction of the third party reviewer in order to comply with NFPA codes and the VA Fire Protection Design Manual; any disputes between the AE and the third party life safety reviewer will be brought to the attention of the VA for determination on a decision.

This project design is to adhere to all building codes and standards including Joint Commission Accreditation Standards, NFPA Codes, VA Specifications and Standards, and AIA Standards unless otherwise approved in writing by VA.  Design is to follow all information outlined in VA Technical Information Library located at http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/dGuide.asp unless otherwise approved in writing by VA.  Please note: The VA is its own AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction) and is, therefore, not necessarily required to comply with the requirements of other AHJs with which the AE firm may have worked.

AE is to investigate the level of Blast Protection requirements that will be needed and design accordingly; information on these requirements available on above website.

If solicited AE is to provide separate and appropriately delineated cost line item in fee proposal for programming services related to this project.  This will be awarded at VA's discretion. 

In order to present design options to hospital management for support/consensus, skills/abilities in architectural modeling and/or BIM (Building Management Modeling) is required.  AE selection requirements for design of this construction project will include knowledge and capability in addressing Federal mandates including sustainability and energy conservation goals.  Selection criteria will consider experience with the principles of energy conservation and sustainability.  AE is required to have professional credentials in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) AP with specialty credentials representing a demonstration of an advanced level of green building knowledge and LEED practices, and have produced a minimum LEED silver certification for projects with similar size and scope of this project.  

The AE shall incorporate green building and sustainable design practices and elements into project design to the greatest extent practicable and as per VA Sustainable Design & Energy Reduction Manual.  The project design shall meet the Guiding Principles for Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings (Guiding Principles) and all energy/water/environmental requirements established by EPACT 2005, EISA 2007, EOs 13514 and 13423, and VA Directive 0055.  This design (including major mechanical equipment) will require energy modeling (annual building or zone simulation based on local weather data), and analysis during planning and all phases of design to achieve the energy budgets required in the above laws.  The typical design analysis will include a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) on three different alternatives.  For example: an AE may choose to analyze a project by analyzing and modeling the replacement of original equipment, a radiant system, or a heat pump system when designing an air handling system.  

Follow third-party criteria according to a multi-attribute green building standard or rating system developed by an ANSI-accredited organization.  Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and Green Globes are the two approved rating systems.  At minimum, LEED Silver criteria shall be followed for this design.  If solicited certification to be priced separately:  Please include actual LEED Silver certification as a separate and appropriately delineated cost line item in fee proposal for award at VA's discretion. 

Use ENERGYSTAR benchmarking tool or equivalent in Portfolio Manager to monitor energy improvements and cost savings following one year of occupancy in the new installation.  To meet the "Optimize energy performance" principle, this design is expected to:

"	Reduce energy use by at least 30% compared to the baseline building performance rating created using ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1 - 2007  Energy Standard, Appendix G.
"	Be designed so that fossil fuel generated energy consumption is reduced from the 2003 Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) baseline, by 55% in FY 2010 and 65% in FY 2015 for the applicable category of building. 
"	Provide at least 15% of total electricity use for the facility through on-site renewable energy production (VA policy).
"	Feature the use of a combined heat and power (cogeneration) system in each new medical facility unless proven not feasible technically and economically (VA policy).

<p>The purpose of this requirement is to conduct evidence-based reviews of conditions nominated for the Recommend Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), using accepted industry standards and best practices, to inform the Discretionary Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children's decision making process.</p>

<p><strong>BACKGROUND: <br /></strong>The Discretionary Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (Committee) was established under the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 217a: Advisory councils or committees. This Committee fulfills the functions previously undertaken by the former Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children, established under Section 1111 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS), 42 U.S.C. 300b-10, as amended in the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2008. The Committee is governed by the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), which sets forth standards for the formation and use of advisory committees. The Health Resources Services Administration/Maternal and Child Health Bureau (HRSA/MCHB) provides coordination, management, and operational services to the Committee, with direction and guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Committee is to provide the Secretary with recommendations, advice, and technical information regarding the most appropriate application of technologies, policies, guidelines, and standards for: (a) effectively reducing morbidity and mortality in newborns and children having, or at risk for, heritable disorders; and (b) enhancing the ability of state and local health agencies to provide for newborn and child screening, counseling, and health care services for newborns and children having, or at risk for, heritable disorders. Specifically, the Committee makes systematic evidence-based recommendations on newborn screening for conditions that have the potential to significantly impact public health for all newborns, including secondary conditions that may be identified as a result of the laboratory methods used for screening.</p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS <br /></strong>The following provides potential responders with an overview of the types of support that would be required of the contractor.</p>

Each review must include a systematic evidence-based review of a rare, genetic condition and its corresponding newborn screening test(s), confirmatory test(s), and treatment; an analysis of the benefits and harms of newborn screening at the population level; and a systematic public health impact assessment that examines state newborn screening programs' readiness and feasibility to adopt comprehensive screening for the condition under consideration.</p>
<p>b. Develop an evidenced-based methodology, conduct, and lead an evidence review to meet the requirements of the Committee<br />c. Form an evidence-based workgroup (ERW) comprised of individuals with expertise in one or more of the following: newborn screening, epidemiology, evidence-based review methodology, general pediatrics, genetics, public health, bioethics, health economics, science writing and editing.</p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) is seeking parties interested in collaborative development to mature technologies required for NASAs future missions and to enhance life on Earth.  JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <p> Purpose: <P> NASA JSC seeks to enhance technology associated with Estimating/Balancing Risk & Performance during System or Project Design & Development. NASA JSC has implemented various Excel-based analysis tools to evaluate the performance and characteristics of vehicles and missions early in their design phases.  The software tools are used to assess the relative benefits and drawbacks of system design or mission architecture options.    <p> Technology: <P> NASA JSC has developed a Rapid Response Risk Assessment (R3A) tool that provides a unique infrastructure for quickly defining the system components and critical events involved in completing a desired endeavor, providing easy to use trade space selection options which evaluate, in real time, each option's influence on the probability of successfully completing the desired endeavor. <p> NASA JSC also developed an Excel-based software tool, Envision, which is a vehicle mass, power and volume estimation tool.  Through a previous NASA JSC initiative, an initial capability has been developed that ties these two tools together. The integration of these tools allows the rapid evaluation of performance measures such as mass and power as well as the accompanying mission risk metrics early in the design process to inform and impact mission architecture decisions. With this capability, NASA JSC will be well positioned to lead the way in future Agency and Programmatic architecture development efforts, regardless of the architectural destination.  <p> R&D Status: <P> The current toolset includes the use of Excel software modules (visual BASIC) and advanced Excel functions and operations.  NASA JSC has begun the research for the capability and has an extensive knowledge of the tools inner workings and algorithms of the current version, as well as the event tree analysis process and system reliability/availability discipline knowledge that is built into the requirements.  <P> NASA JSC seeks to extend and enhance the current capability by adding functions and capabilities to either (1) the R3A tool itself, and/or (2) a combined Excel toolset. Requirements would involve Excel-based visual BASIC skills and advanced Excel-based knowledge of functions and data manipulation processes. Other desired capabilities include developing a cost estimation component of the tool. <p> Intellectual Property (IP): <P> This Partner relationship may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner. <p> This announcement is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided. Since this is an Announcement, no evaluation letters or results will be issued to the respondents. <p> Please submit the attached Statement of Interest Form to Mark Dillard <p> To view all Co-Development and Partnering Opportunities with the NASA Johnson Space Center please visit our website at <A HREF="http://1.usa.gov/1bL99AF">http://1.usa.gov/1bL99AF </A>	   <p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) is seeking parties interested in collaborative development and mature technologies required for NASAs future missions and to enhance life on Earth.  JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <p> Purpose: <p> JSC is seeking to further develop NASA JSCs current Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) methodology, which utilizes placeholder risk values to represent the risk of losing a mission due to software/automation.  These placeholder values are based on general, high-level assessments and are not program/software specific during the design process. As future space programs utilize more automated processes, a need exists to meet the challenge of identifying more specific software risk contributors.  <p> Technology: <p> NASA JSC has been working to better understand the risk of software as a contributor in future space missions and to advance current technologies to address the risks of software required functionality that would be compatible and consistent with the standard PRA methodology currently employed by NASA JSC.  Given a generic application of software across industries, the same can be said and a substantial application of this methodology can be foreseen.  <p> R&D Status: <p> The current toolset includes the Space Shuttle Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) methodology. Initial research for this technology has begun; no development initiatives to date. <p> Intellectual Property (IP): <p> This Partner relationship may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner. <p> This announcement is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) is seeking parties interested in collaborative development and mature technologies required for NASAs future missions and to enhance life on Earth.  JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <p> Purpose: <p> NASA JSC seeks to advance the state-of-the-art software tools that include knowledge management, information management, information technology, and artificial intelligence leading toward the ability for computer systems to assist humans in correctly identifying, quantifying, characterizing, mitigating, and communicating risks in a timely manner, thereby informing decision makers of risks before the decisions are made. Application of advanced computer-based decision support technologies to identify and assess relevant data, identify alternatives, and model consequences will significantly reduce the cost of development, deployment, and sustainment of complex systems and significantly increase safety of humans. <p> As space systems become more complex and human space exploration destinations get farther away from Earth, the flight crew may be forced to make timely decisions in responding to imminent hazardous conditions without the assistance of the ground crew. <p> Technology: <p> Examples of desired technology enhancements include: <p> 	Timely Risk Identification  NASA JSC desires to advance development of an automated failure modes and effects (FMEA) simulation technology.  This technology would be a game-changer by identifying safety and technical risks of the design early and quickly such that design changes or trades can be made to eliminate these risks at a much lower lifecycle cost and significantly improve safety and system reliability. For several decades, the FMEA has been used to identify risks inherent in space system designs. Analysis results are frequently not available until the system design has matured to the point where it is ready for final development, test, and or deployment. Changes late in the design lifecycle often cannot be accommodated due to significant schedule delay and cost increase. Although designing out hazards is the most effective and preferred means of control, mitigations for identified risks at this time are usually limited to procedural controls which require recurring attention throughout the operational phase. This often results in operational complexity, higher risk, and higher sustaining cost. <p> 	Risk-Informed Decision Making  NASA JSC desires to advance the development of risk-informed decision support technologies such as automated systems diagnostic and prognostic tools that would suggest actions that have the highest probability of success. <p> R&D Status: <p> The FMEA Assistance Tool is currently under development.  It includes a failure mode library with system types. The tool has an executable source code written in Lisp.  NASA would potentially need to discuss migration to another programming language depending on partnering implementation plans.  The Technology Readiness Level is TRL-3. <p> The Risk-Informed Decision Support Tool (RIDST) is currently in development with QualTech Systems, Inc. and with Montana State University under a NASA Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program Phase I grant. <p> Intellectual Property (IP): <p> This Partner relationship may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner. <p> This announcement is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) is seeking parties interested in collaborative development and mature technologies required for NASAs future missions and to enhance life on Earth.  JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <p> Purpose: <p> NASA JSC seeks partners to better understand limitations and potential performance shaping factors (PSF) for a space-based Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) method. Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM) is a bi-directional analysis method that is used for both performance prediction and accident analysis. Unlike first generation error analysis methods such as Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP), CREAM represents a second generation tool allowing for better analysis by abandoning the hierarchical structure of previous methods and providing better separation between objective and subjective error.  Assistance with breaking apart the current ground based PSFs and recombining with the additional long duration, space-based PSFs is needed.  <p> Technology: <p> NASA JSCs current HRA methodology, as well as all other methods currently available, is based on ground data sources.  The Space Shuttle Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) was used to assess all known risk contributors, such as human/crew reliability, in support of the programs risk-informed decision-making process.  <p> The Shuttle PRA used a combination of HRA techniques.  Once the human actions were identified, the majority of them were initially quantified with an analysis methodology that is essentially based on the THERP, as described in NUREG/CR-1278, Handbook of Human Reliability Analysis with Emphasis on Nuclear Power Plant Applications.  The initial THERP-like quantification serves as a screening analysis to identify the risk-dominant human errors. The risk-dominant human errors are then evaluated in further detail using the extended CREAM. <p> For future space programs with 200 to 900 day missions, crew fatigue, low gravity physiological effects, and crew health may become more significant factors in assessing human reliability; thus, the need to expand the capability of the current ground-based HRA techniques.  <p> The technology is in early development, i.e., Technology Readiness Level TRL-1. <p> R&D Status: <p> The current toolset includes both the CREAM and the THERP HRA approaches.  Both of these approaches are based on humans tested on the ground.  As human space missions head to Mars and asteroids, mission durations will last 400 to 900 days, which is much longer than any mission performed to-date.  It is believed that long duration missions in low gravity can result in fatigue and physiological effects on human crews, which can impact their reliability of performing human actions; thus, the importance for the vehicles and mission training to better account for these effects on the crew.  <p> Intellectual Property (IP): <p> This Partner relationship may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner. <p> This announcement is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided. Since this is an Announcement, no evaluation letters or results will be issued to the respondents. <p> Please submit the attached Statement of Interest Form to Mark Dillard <p> To view all Co-Development and Partnering Opportunities with the NASA Johnson Space Center please visit our website <A HREF="http://1.usa.gov/1bL99AF">http://1.usa.gov/1bL99AF </A>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) is seeking parties interested in collaborative development and mature technologies required for NASAs future missions and to enhance life on Earth.  JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <p> Purpose: <p> NASA JSC is seeking parties interested in co-developing technology associated with health screening and health status monitoring. <p> These technologies address anticipated human medical conditions and individual susceptibilities to environmental stressors and disease.  Screening technologies sought are to personalize in-flight medical planning and care, pharmacogenomics, radiation exposure-associated risks, and the development of capabilities for prevention, screening for risk factors, and radiation biomarkers for early diagnosis and effective treatment. <p> Health indicators to be addressed include, but are not limited to: malignancies, cataracts, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), cardiovascular risks, bone loss, oxidative stress, renal stone formation, sleep disorders, anxiety/depression, susceptibility to radiation and elevated CO2 levels. Particular importance is given to radiation exposure-associated risks as mentioned above. <p> It is anticipated that the medical screening technologies co-developed will be of great interest to doctors and hospitals that desire quick and accurate patient medical information.  These technologies will also be of great interest to persons providing remote medical care to such places as underdeveloped countries and military field hospitals.  The radiation screening technology will have great relevance to many industries. <p> Technology: <p> From the research and medical operational needs, these targeted conditions fall into seven categories: <p> The first category is musculoskeletal injuries/traumas requiring high contrast high-resolution visualization of bone, muscle and connective tissues for the detection of injury to determine proper treatment. Gaps in this category include: <p> 	Meeting two often-conflicting needs for the ability to take images within bony structures versus maintaining high contrast in the surrounding soft tissues. <p> 	Inability to obtain images of fracture using spaceflight compatible hardware. Forward technology development aims should include improving the capability to penetrate both soft tissue and underlying bone to diagnose fractures. Additional capabilities should include the ability to provide contrast enhancement in connective tissues and develop quantitative techniques for measuring bone degradation, muscle atrophy, changes in the lumbar spine, and compartment syndrome during exploration missions. Further gap closure might necessitate developing compact, flight-qualified radiographic capabilities for projection (and potentially tomographic) imaging. <p> The second category includes internal injuries/traumas, which require high resolution, high contrast imaging to identify fluid collections and to locate subtle, often occult, injury sites in the soft parenchymal and connective tissues and their associated vasculature. Forward technology development aims in this area include improving the capability to visualize soft tissue deeper within the abdomen in sites that are currently occult (e.g., the pancreas), and providing contrast enhancement among abdominal and thoracic tissues. Further gap closure might necessitate developing flight-qualified radiographic capabilities for projection (and especially tomographic) imaging. Imaging derived technologies may also provide capability for treatment of specific conditions such as renal colic and internal hemorrhage. <p> Four categories of conditions including ear/nose/throat (ENT) pathologies, ophthalmic injuries/ pathologies, topical injuries/pathologies, and oral/dental pathologies, are more amenable to traditional optical imaging techniques for diagnosis. These conditions sometimes require high-resolution images for the detection of relatively small pathologies. Gaps in these areas include the need to address a wide variety of conditions and the need to obtain depth penetration in lesions. <p> The final category, cardiovascular pathology, requires high resolution, high contrast dynamic imaging of the heart muscle anatomy, arterial and vascular condition and blood flow in all areas of the cardiovascular system. Gaps in this category include meeting the need to produce high-resolution images (sub-millimeter resolution) with high temporal fidelity. Generally, successful utilization of less intuitive imaging technologies by minimally trained personnel to ensure ease of use and interpretation is a challenge that must be addressed. <p> R&D Status: <p> Screening technologies to personalize in-flight medical planning and care include: <p> - Pharmacogenomics; <p> - Disease and therapeutic monitoring markers for better diagnosis and treatment; and <p> - Genomic screening and health status markers (predictive and preventive value) <p> Intellectual Property (IP): <p> Below are some examples of applicable NASA Technologies: <p> 	Isotopic biomarkers for rapid assessment of bone mineral balance in biomedical applications; <p> 	Accurate and Rapid Test for diagnosis of Viral Infections of the Eye; and <p> 	"On Orbit Immuno-based, Label-free, White Blood Cell Counting System with MicroElectroMechanical Sensor (MEMS) Technology (OILWBCS-MEMS). <p> Detailed information for the above mentioned technologies furnished upon request. <p> This co-development project may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner. <p> This announcement is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided. Since this is an Announcement, no evaluation letters or results will be issued to the respondents. <p> Please submit the attached Statement of Interest Form to Mark Dillard <p> To view all Co-Development and Partnering Opportunities with the NASA Johnson Space Center please visit our website <A HREF="http://1.usa.gov/1bL99AF">http://1.usa.gov/1bL99AF </A>

Likely contamination events will include fungal contamination of interior surfaces and bacterial contamination of potable water systems. Future requirements include a need for extended shelf life of consumables, improved autonomy of humans to monitor and respond without outside technical support, and the provision of greater information for decision-making.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) is seeking parties interested in collaborative development and mature technologies required for NASAs future missions and to enhance life on Earth.  JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <p> Purpose: <p> NASA JSC seeks parties interested in co-developing technology associated with Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) systems.	 <p> VBN systems are a mainstay in the space industry and the technology developed can be applied to many terrestrial applications.  Advancing this technology for other applications can be of mutual benefit as a dual-use technology to many industries, as noted above. <p> Technology: <p> NASA has used Vision Based Navigation (VBN) extensively in many of its programs.  For example, cislunar applications involve determining the inertial position and velocity of the vehicle given a set of camera images of the planetary/lunar surface for targeting insertion or entry interface conditions. Additional application of VBN in the cislunar environment involves providing vehicle state information based on surface imagery identifying known landmarks (e.g. craters and mountainous topography). Vehicle relative navigation involves the use of natural feature image recognition, stereo photo clinometry, or visual odometry techniques to provide navigational information relative to a cooperative/uncooperative target vehicle for rendezvous and proximity operations. <p> R&D Status: <p> Extensive technology exists for Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) systems for both space and terrestrial use.  Examples include VBN systems for autonomous aircraft refueling, autonomous robotic vehicle navigation and unmanned aerial vehicle navigation. <p> Intellectual Property (IP): <p> 	Laser Camera System/Space Vision System <p> 	Stitched Camera Array for Clearance Monitoring <P> Detailed information for the above mentioned technologies furnished upon request. <p> This co-development project may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner. <p> This announcement is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided. Since this is an Announcement, no evaluation letters or results will be issued to the respondents. <p> Please submit the attached Statement of Interest Form to Mark Dillard <p> To view all Co-Development and Partnering Opportunities with the NASA Johnson Space Center please visit our website <A HREF="http://1.usa.gov/1bL99AF">http://1.usa.gov/1bL99AF </A>

JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <p> Purpose: <P> NASA JSC is seeking parties interested in co-developing technology associated with the Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT). <p> The ALHAT Project addresses the development, integration, and testing of an advanced 3-D flash LIDAR camera with a detector array of 256x256 pixels or larger. The primary functional objectives for the advanced flash LIDAR camera are improvements in range accuracy, dynamic range, sensitivity, and overall noise characteristics. The primary design objectives are a larger detector array combined with reductions in size, mass, and power. <p> The ALHAT technology can be updated and modified to address any earth-bound navigation challenges that requires real-time terrain mapping under any lighting conditions, and highly accurate ground relative range and velocity measurements to support precision navigation. <p> Technology: <P> The ALHAT Project has developed and tested sensor packages that have validated the utility of active LIDAR sensors for real-time hazard detection and precision landing. The ALHAT Project utilizes a 3-D flash LIDAR camera for real-time terrain mapping under any lighting conditions, and has also developed and tested advanced laser altimeter and Doppler LIDAR sensors that provide highly accurate ground relative range and velocity measurements to support precision landing. Enhancements desired include detecting variations in surface roughness of 30cm and local slopes of 5 degrees at operational ranges of 1000 meters or greater. NASA JSC seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in sensors and techniques for planetary landing systems. <p> R&D Status: <P> Upcoming autonomous, closed-loop flights of the current ALHAT system on the Morpheus 1.5B rocket-powered test bed at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) will mature the existing sensors. <p> Intellectual Property (IP): <p> 	Cooperative Relative Navigation of Spacecraft at Close Range using Flash LIDARs <p> 	Flash LIDAR Cooperative Pose Software <p> 	LIDAR Electro-optic beam switch with a Liquid Crystal Variable Retarder (T-00124) <p> 	A Technique for Finding Retro-Reflectors in Flash LIDAR Imagery <p> Detailed information for the above mentioned technologies furnished upon request. <p> This co-development project may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner. <p> This announcement is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided.

JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <p> Purpose: <p> NASA JSC seeks parties interested in co-developing technology associated with planetary entry, descent, and landing (EDL) system architectures applicable or extensible to human Mars missions. <p> Advancing these technologies will be of benefit to any entity that desires an entry, descent and landing capability. <p> Technology: <p> The technologies sought could be applicable to any facet of the EDL scenario, such as aero capture, atmospheric entry, supersonic/subsonic deceleration, or terminal landing. The technologies should contribute to enabling a high mass planetary landing mission by providing attributes of low mass, constrained volume for launch vehicle compatibility, reduced entry heating, low sensitivity to dispersions and system failures, and/or pinpoint landing.  Evidence of the applicability and benefit to an overall feasible architecture for EDL is required.  Viable methodologies for test and validation of the technology should be considered.  Comparative evaluations with current or alternate EDL architecture concepts for effectiveness in reducing mission risks are also desirable. <p> R&D Status: <p> The current planetary EDL systems for robotic exploration missions typically involve a system of rigid circular aero shell entry vehicles, parachutes, propulsive deceleration, and/or airbags.  However, these systems lose effectiveness or feasibility when scaled to the size required for human missions or extremely large payloads.  As an example, the Mars Science Laboratory successfully placed approximately 1 metric ton of payload on the surface of Mars, whereas a human Mars mission would likely require a landed payload mass of 40 metric tons or possibly greater. <p> Intellectual Property (IP): <p> 	Automated, Real-Time Targeting and Guidance (ARTGUID) Software for Lunar-Descent and Precision Landing <p> 	Autonomous Precision Landing Navigation (APLNav) System <p> 	Orion Guidance, Navigation, and Control Flight Software Detailed information for the above mentioned technologies furnished upon request. <p> This co-development project may produce new IP that could be jointly owned by NASA and the partner or may become the property of the partner. <p> This announcement is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information provided.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) is seeking parties interested in collaborative development and mature technologies required for NASAs future missions and to enhance life on Earth.  JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <p> Purpose: <P> NASA JSC seeks to extend technology associated with their existing rovers for earth-bound applications such as rugged, remote and hazardous environments. These rovers can be updated and adapted to address any earth-bound application that requires an autonomous robotic vehicle or a manned vehicle with a protective environment. <p> Technology: <P> NASA JSC has developed two planetary exploration rovers, the Space Exploration Vehicle (SEV) and the Centaur 2. The SEV is a large electric rover that can function as a manned vehicle or as an autonomous robotic vehicle. The SEV consists of a chassis with six wheel modules capable of 360 of motion, enabling it to drive in any direction and to point-turn the entire vehicle, and a cabin for human-use which also serves as a mounting location for robotic sensors.  The SEV chassis without the cabin can carry a variety of objects. The current SEV can cover very rugged terrain, maneuver steep inclines and perform straight-line driving at a top speed of 12 MPH using its Six Degrees of Freedom (6-DOF) chassis. The Centaur 2 rover has 4 wheel modules, and like the SEV, can point-turn and drive in any direction. Centaur 2 can carry science-payloads, geologic tools or even a Robonaut 2. <p> The primary technology challenges include higher energy density batteries and active suspension and obstacle avoidance/detection to achieve higher speeds in a wide range of environments. These challenges are directly applicable to the next generation of electric vehicles. <p> R&D Status: <P> The technology associated with these vehicles is advanced.  NASA continuously addresses challenges associated with these technologies as advancements in specific components develop, e.g., lighter and higher energy batteries. <p> Intellectual Property (IP): <P> Multiple individual technologies associated with robotics are currently available for co-development and licensing.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) is seeking parties interested in collaborative development and mature technologies required for NASAs future missions and to enhance life on Earth.  JSC is looking to partner on the development of broadly applicable technologies as a means to accelerate technology development and strengthen commercialization of federally-funded research and development. <p> Purpose: <p> NASA JSC seeks parties interested in co-developing technology associated with its current robotic vehicle capabilities.	 <p> NASA intends to address the areas of overall performance, controls modeling and safety, in addition to robotic perception and intelligence.  NASA JSC has multiple mobile robot prototypes for planetary exploration. Each of these vehicles is capable of autonomous driving and has sensor packages that provide large streams of environmental data. While these robots are intended for use during human spaceflight missions, NASA JSC desires to employ the robots as explorers during periods of unmanned activity. Earth-based human supervised autonomy is the expected mode of operation for these robotic explorers. The data time delay can range from 2 seconds to 1.5 minutes from vehicle to earth and back to the vehicle (round-trip). Due to these expected and variable data and command latencies, NASA JSC plans to provide predictive models of robot behavior to earth-based human operations supervisors. <p> Technology associated with Predictive Path-Planning for Robotic Vehicles will be of interest to any entity that desires a navigation system for a completely autonomous vehicle. <p> Technology: <p> Primary challenges include robust sensing of the environment, bandwidth management of data and user-centered interface development. <p> The main mobile robots developed at NASA JSC are the Space Exploration Vehicle (SEV) and the Centaur 2 rovers. The SEV is a large electric rover that can function as a manned vehicle or as an autonomous robotic vehicle. The SEV consists of a chassis with six wheel modules capable of 360 of motion, enabling it to drive in any direction and to point-turn the entire vehicle, and a cabin for human-use and which also serves as a mounting location for robotic sensors.	The SEV chassis without the cabin can carry a variety of payloads. The current SEV can cover very rugged terrain, maneuver steep inclines and perform straight-line driving at a top speed of 12 MPH using its Six Degrees of Freedom (6-DOF) chassis. The Centaur 2 rover has 4 wheel modules, and like the SEV, can point-turn and drive in any direction. Centaur 2 can carry science-payloads, geologic tools or even a Robonaut 2. <p> Path planning for these rovers will consist of avoiding large objects on a surface (e.g., rocks or human habitats), avoiding craters, driving through permanently dark areas and potentially driving through lava tubes. The human operators supervising the robots must easily model path planning for use. <p> R&D Status: <p> The NASA JSC rovers currently use a predictive and interactive graphical interface (PIGI) for unmanned operations over time delays. PIGI provides telemetry from the robot to a human operations supervisor through a visualization of the robot's environment. PIGI has proven useful for varying communication latencies, minimal bandwidths and variable network speeds. Current path planning for use in PIGI allows the SEV and Centaur 2 rovers to avoid obstacles. JSC desires to produce path-planning models for the robots that will allow them to operate in varying planetary situations, as noted earlier. <p> Intellectual Property:  Multiple individual technologies associated with robotics are currently available for co-development and licensing.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>BACKGROUND: The mission of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) was organized to address increasing scientific, regulatory, and Congressional concerns about the human health effects of chemical agents in our environment. NICEATM contributes to the mission of NIEHS and the NTP by evaluating, developing, validating, and promoting the acceptance and utilization of improved safety assessment tools to protect, promote, and advance the health of people, animals, and the environment. The NICEATM Office is located at NIEHS [Research Triangle Park (RTP), NC] and consists of two Government Staff members augmented with appropriate contract support.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting NIEHS and NTP, NICEATM is also responsible for ensuring compliance with duties and provisions of the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) Authorization Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 285l-3). The overall goal of ICCVAM is to promote the research, development, validation, evaluation, acceptance, and use of new and alternative testing methods and strategies that are more predictive of human health and ecological effects than currently available methods and strategies. ICCVAM is a statutorily mandated interagency committee established under NICEATM. NICEATM carries out its mission by performing independent Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities, reviewing proposed test methods, organizing workshops, and facilitating peer reviews. Proposed test methods include those submitted to ICCVAM by developers that include a complete submission package as well as those nominated by the general public or the Member Agencies making up ICCVAM that require additional validation studies, also supported through this effort.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this effort is to provide scientific and administrative support for NICEATM. NICEATM research supports activities of the NTP's Biomolecular Screening Branch (BSB), the Tox21 consortium, and the ICCVAM.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: This effort requires that Contract Staff be physically located in close proximity (within 30 minute drive) to the NIEHS campus. The nature of the support role requires frequent, often impromptu, in-person meetings with NICEATM Government Staff members. Contract staff must be prepared to meet with NICEATM Government Staff daily (2-4 hours) and on short-notice (within two hours of request). In addition, a high degree of collaboration between staff, especially toxicologists, computational toxicologists, and bio/cheminformaticists is required. Therefore, all contract staff are required to be co-located (in the same physical location) in order to facilitate a collaborative environment with frequent interactions between staff.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: Pre-Validation Screening - The Contractor shall acquire and apply new and existing scientific knowledge to develop, evaluate, and validate novel computational approaches that can be used for chemical prioritization, hazard identification and risk assessment with direct relevance to human health; Research, Development, and Validation of Alternative Test Methods - In order to promote the research, development, validation, acceptance, and use of new and alternative testing methods and strategies, ICCVAM coordinates the evaluation of submitted and nominated test methods; Test Method Pre-Screen Evaluations and Pre-Screen Evaluation Report - The Contractor will receive Test Method Submission/Nomination Packages for evaluation. The Contractor shall review the information provided in the Test Method Submissions/Nominations for completeness with regard to each of the ICCVAM validation and acceptance criteria; Coordination of Validation Studies -Occasionally, additional validation studies of Test Method Submissions/Nominations will be necessary. The Contractor shall support tasks involved with the coordination of validation study(ies); Test Method Background Review Documents (BRDs) - the Contractor shall develop Background Review Documents (BRDs), in Draft and Final Draft versions, organize the comprehensive BRDs, provide a compilation of reference lists of chemicals/substances recommended for use in validating test methods, structure each BRD in a monograph format, present the document in an electronic camera-ready format as appropriate for NIH publications, and coordinate the printing and distribution of those documents designated as NIH publications; Test Method Technical Review Document - the Contractor shall assemble a Test Method Technical Review Document. Each Test Method Technical Review Document shall include all available information submitted, obtained, and/or analyzed during the pre-screen process, including the Pre-Screen Evaluation Report and/or the Background Review Document; Test Method Evaluation Report (TMER) - the Contractor shall assemble a Test Method Evaluation Report (TMER) for all Test Method Submissions/Nominations progressing through peer reviews.</p>
<p>General Meeting Support for NICEATM- and ICCVAM-related Meetings [including ICATM (International Cooperation on Alternative Test Methods) and ICATM-Partner Agency Meetings] - The Contractor shall provide support for all meetings deemed necessary to carry out the goals and objectives of NICEATM and ICCVAM; The Contractor shall provide support to NICEATM in preparing updates to documents including but not restricted to the NTP Annual Report, the NICEATM/ICCVAM Five-Year Plan, General Strategic Plan, Standard Operating Procedures, and/or other planning and procedural documents within the scope of the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The Government anticipates a one-year (12 Months) contract with four optional years (12 Months each). The anticipated award date is November 5, 2014. An additional option to extend services not to exceed 6 months shall be included in accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-8.

The Principal Investigator shall have a Ph.D. or comparable doctoral degree in the Life Sciences or Chem/Bio-informatics with a strong background in toxicology. The Senior Toxicologist shall have a Ph.D. and relevant experience and expertise. Certification by the American Board of Toxicology is required.</p>

In addition, it is anticipated that additional LOE may be required throughout the life of the contract. It is anticipated that Optional LOE shall not exceed 9,500 hours per year excluding vacation, holiday, and sick leave. This information is furnished for information only and is not to be considered restrictive.</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL OPTIONS include but are not limited to: Workshop/Meeting Support, and Validation Study Support.</p>

<DESC>The proposed projects are for Maintenance Dredging of Newark Bay, NJ, Federal Navigation Project. <br>  <br> THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT TO BE USED FOR MARKET ANALYSIS ONLY. NO AWARDS WILL BE MADE FROM THE RESPONSES TO THIS SYNOPSIS. NO SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIAL QUALIFIED CONCERNS DOING WORK UNDER NAICS 237990. ANY POTENTIAL COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION(S) THAT MAY PROCEED FROM THIS NOTICE WILL BE POSTED TO FEDBIZOPPS. ALL INTERESTED OFFERORS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT AT A LATER TIME IF AND WHEN A SOLICITATION IS ISSUED.  <br>  <br> The purpose of this announcement is to gain knowledge of potential business sources; with specific interest in small business, certified 8(a) Small Business firms serviced by SBA districts located within New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, certified HUB Zone Small Business firms, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business firms (SDVOSB.  No awards will be made from the responses to this Market Survey. <br> Background Information  <br>  <br> The New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) proposes to perform maintenance dredging of portions of the Newark Bay, New Jersey, Federal Navigation Project. The proposed maintenance dredging would involve the removal of approximately 366,500 cubic yards (approximately 201,000 cubic yards as basic work, and the remaining as options) of selected critical shoals from Port Newark and Port Newark Pierhead Channels to a depth of -40 feet Mean Low Water (MLW) plus one (1) foot allowable overdepth, subject to the availability of funds. The dredged material, consisting primarily of silt and clay, must subsequently be placed at a suitable contractor-furnished, state-permitted upland placement site(s).  It is anticipated that prior to final placement, it will be required to first process the maintenance material at a dredged material processing facility.   <br>  <br> The apparent low bidder shall, within 35 calendar days from the date the apparent low bidder is notified of being such, provide copies of all required permits and approvals for transfer, transportation, dewatering and / or other processing, and final disposal of dredged material, and shall submit evidence of such permits and approvals to the Government.   <br>  <br> Once the contract is awarded, the contractor will be required to maintain an integrated production rate of at least 2,250 cubic yards per calendar day for the dredging, transfer, transportation, dewatering and / or other processing, and final disposal of the material.  The presence of dredging equipment in the channel will impact ship traffic, and it is necessary to maintain this production rate while minimizing the duration of this impact. <br>  <br> Due to restrictions expected to be found in the water quality certificate, it is likely that the proposed work must / can only be performed by a mechanical dredge with a closed environmental clamshell bucket. Additionally, multiple barges and tug boats will be needed to perform the work during the dredging, dewatering and unloading operations. The dredged material will be required to meet all federal, state and local criteria required by the government agencies having jurisdiction where the placement site is located.  All necessary permits required for the dredged material placement will be provided to the Government. <br>  <br> The proposed work is anticipated to take place between April and July 2014.   <br> SURVEY OF THE DREDGING INDUSTRY <br>  <br> The following is a confidential survey questionnaire designed to apprise the Corps of prospective dredging contractors' project execution capabilities. Please provide your response to the following questions. All questions are in regard to the Newark Bay maintenance dredging project.  <br>  <br> General  <br>  <br> 1) Have you ever worked on dredging jobs similar in nature to this project? If so, please describe the project and for whom the work was performed. Identify a point of contact and phone number, if possible.  <br>  <br> 2) What percentage of work (volume of material dredged, transported, dewatered processed, and ultimately placed) can you perform with your own equipment or equipment owned by another small dredging concern? <br>  <br> 3) Have you performed dredging within the waters of the Port of New York and New Jersey? <br>  <br> 4) Would you be willing to bid on the project previously described? If the answer is No, please explain why not?  <br>  <br> 5) Would you be bidding on this project as a sole contractor, prime contractor with subcontractor(s) or as a joint venture?  <br>  <br> 6) Is there a dollar limit on the size contract that you would bid?  <br>  <br> 7) What is the largest dredging contract, in dollars, on which you were the prime contractor?  <br>  <br> 8) What is your bonding capacity per contract? What is your total bonding capacity?  <br>  <br> Equipment <br>  <br> 9) What type of dredge equipment do you own and / or operate that is suitable for the work described?  Do you own a closed environmental clamshell bucket?  Please list each piece of equipment capable of performing each type of work described, i.e. dredging, transfer, transportation, dewatering and/or other processing, and final disposal of the material.  For each dredge that you list, please specify its bucket size(s), and any other salient characteristics.  <br>  <br> 10) Identify which dredge(s), including support equipment (tug, scows, etc), you would employ on this project.

<DESC>USAMMDA, located at Fort Detrick, Maryland, develops new drugs, vaccines, and medical support devices that enhance readiness, ensure provisions of the highest quality medical care to the DoD and maximize the survival of medical casualties on the battlefield.  USAMMDA is seeking technology that can improve upon available field tests for rapid identification of coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli in water.  Currently available technology requires water samples to be incubated for up to 24 hours; USAMMDA wishes to identify new technology that can greatly reduce analysis time and improve other operational characteristics.  The new technology will be used by US Army Preventive Medicine personnel to analyze both treated and untreated water.  To represent substantial improvements over available technologies, we are seeking technology with the following characteristics that can detect the presence/absence of both coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli:   <br>  <br> (1)	Comparability of results to US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) reference methods.   The proposed technology must be able to meet testing requirements under the US EPA's Alternative Test Procedure, for use in drinking water applications covered by the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Total Coliform Rule.  The new technology results must be comparable to those of US EPA-approved reference methods (40 CFR Parts 136 and 141) and be suitable for use with chlorine-stressed bacteria.  Reference methods for coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli bacteria include Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater method numbers 9221B and 9221F, respectively. <br> (2)	Response time.  The proposed technology should be able to demonstrate that a water sample contains less than one coliform or E. coli bacteria in 100 milliliters of water in 12 hours or less.  Immediate indication should be provided when a sample is found have higher coliform or E. coli concentrations or when sample testing demonstrating non-contamination is complete. <br> (3)	Size and weight.  A hand-held device is desirable; in no case should the weight of the proposed technology exceed 42 pounds. <br> (4)	Ease of operation.  The proposed technology should require minimal operator training for sample preparation and technology operation.  Further, the technology (including both sampling and testing apparatus) should be simple to operate with a minimum of parts and accessories. <br>

<p>USU has a requirement for brain harvesting services. It is our intent to award a firm fixed price (FFP) option year contract (Base, with four (4) one (1) year options = Five (5) years total).</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice. Offerors capable and interested in responding to this requirement must notify the contract specialist in writing by 10:00 PM Eastern local time by January 20, 2014. Responses must be emailed to michelle.creenan@usuhs.edu.</p>
<p>Responses must include the following information:<br />&bull; Company Name<br />&bull; Company Point of Contact, to include phone number and email<br />&bull; DUNS<br />&bull; Socioeconomic Status<br />&bull; Capability statement: Demonstrating that you can meet the requirements listed below, which includes resume showing experience in performing brain harvesting</p>
<p>Statement of Work (SOW):</p>
<p>Background / Scope<br />It is required that the brains specimens selected for our School of Medicine shall be selected from cadavers that have been properly donated to medical science. The ideal cadaver for brain harvesting shall be a cadaver that has no obvious head trauma. A cadaver that has been diagnosed with cancer not affecting the head or neck, or any other anotomical structures below the clavicle, shall be considered optimum specimens for brain harvesting.</p>
<p>With coordination of State and local authorities, the vendor shall ensure that the death certificate has been signed, and cadaver's cause of death verified. The vendor shall ensure that cause of death will not in any way affect, or produce a hazard to the future students, staff and faculty that may have contact with the brain specimen(s), such as one diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease and / or HIV. Vendor must provide copy of death certificate from source of body from which brain is harvested.</p>
<p>The following are excerpts for dissection from well published dissector guides used in School of Medicine daily laboratory settings. The overall purpose of this guide is to ensure that the specimens are dissected to best assure the specimen are of the best of quality for teaching purposes. Follow the guidelines as indicated.</p>
<p>Clinical Head and Neck Neuroscience Dissection Instructions for Harvesting of Brain Specimens</p>
<p>Exterior of the Skull<br />(Before you dissect)</p>
<p>With the Cadaver in the supine position place a block under the back of the head.</p>
<p>Dissection Instructions:</p>
<p>Scalp</p>
<p>Careful dissection of brain specimens is paramount. It becomes obvious when a brain specimen arrives for dissection that blade marks, and cuts in the brain occurred post mortem. These careless errors cost money. Multiple specimens must be dissected to make up for erroneous dissecting mistakes. Please take caution to ensure that the best dissecting techniques are followed at all times.</p>
<p>The incisions should be made through the entire scalp and the scalpel should contact the bones of the calvaria.</p>
<p>Make a midline incision from the nasion to the vertex. Extend this incision to the external occipital protuberance.</p>
<p>Make a transverse incision from the vertex to the ear. Duplicate this cut on the opposite side of the head.</p>
<p>Beginning at the Vertex, use Rocherster-Oschner forceps (straight, 1 vs. 2 teeth, 6 &frac14;") to grasp one corner of the incise scalp and insert an osteotome (straight, double bevel, &frac12;") between the scalp and the calvaria. Use the osteotome to loosen the scalp from the calvaria.</p>
<p>Once the flap of the scalp is raised, grasp the flap the 2 forceps and pull it inferiorly. Do not detach the flaps.</p>
<p>Reflect all four flaps of scalp down to the level that a hatband would occupy.</p>
<p><br />Interior of the Skull<br />(Before you dissect)</p>
<p>The bones of the calvaria provide protective covering for the cerebral hemispheres. To view the internal features of the cranial cavity, the calvaria must be removed. In addition, a wedge of occipital bone will be removed to open the dissection field and make a removal of the brain easier.</p>
<p>The order of dissection will be as follows: The scalp and temporalis muscle will be reflected inferiorly. The calvaria will be cut with a Stryker saw and removed. A wedge of occipital bone will be removed. The dura mater will be examined and then opened to reveal the arachnoid mater and pia mater.</p>
<p>Dissection Instructions</p>
<p>Removal of the Calvaria<br />The calvaria should be in the supine position. Fold the flaps of the scalp inferiorly.</p>
<p>On the lateral surface of the calvaria, beginning at the superior temporal line, use a scalpel to detach the temporalis muscle from the calvaria. Reflect the temporalis muscle inferiorly over the reflected scalp.</p>
<p>Scrape the bone with an osteotome to clean the periosteum and muscle fibers.</p>
<p>Use a pencil to draw a line around the circumference of the skull cap &frac34; of an inch above the upper margin of the orbit anteriorly and &frac12; inch above the External Occipital protuberance (EOP) posteriorly.</p>
<p>Use the Stryker saw to cut through the outer table of bone along the pencil line. The guide for reaching the diploe or marrow cavity is seeing red-brown sawdust. Proceed carefully in the temporal region as the bone is thin here.<br />After you have made the saw cut, insert an osteotome into the cut and strike with a mallet to split the inner table of bone around the entire circumference. The calvaria still cannot be lifted free because the periosteal dura is fused to the interior of the skull.</p>
<p>Remove the calvaria by detaching it from the dura mater with your fingers or the handle of a forceps. Work from anterior to posterior and do not use more force than is necessary. Violent pulling may result in tearing of the dura and damage to the brain.</p>
<p>Removal of a Wedge of Occipital Bone<br />Place the cadaver in the prone position.</p>
<p>Use a scalpel to detach the semispinalis capitis muscle, splenius capitis muscle, obliquus capitis superior muscle, and the rectus capitis posterior major and minor muscles from the occipital bone.</p>
<p>Identify the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane, which spans the interval between the atlas and the occipital bone. Use scissors to incise the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane transversely from the left vertebral artery to the right vertebral artery.<br /><br />Use a scalpel or osteotome to scrape the occipital bone clean of remaining muscle fibers and pericranium.</p>
<p>On the skull, note the point where the lambdoid suture meets the saw cut where the calvarium was removed. Transfer this point to the cadaver specimen and mark the location with a pencil.</p>
<p>On the external surface of the skull, identify the lateral margin of the foramen magnum and transfer this point to the cadaver specimen.</p>
<p>On the right and left sides of the cadaver, connect points A and B with a pencil line to define the wedge of occipital bone that will be removed in the cadaver.</p>
<p>Use a Stryker saw to cut along the pencil lines. As in the removal of the calvaria, do not cut through the inner lamina of compact bone.</p>
<p>Extend the saw cut into the foramen magnum but preserve the vertebral arteries.</p>
<p>Loosen the wedge of bone with osteotome and mallet and remove it, leaving the dura mater intact.</p>
<p>Removal of the Brain<br />(Before you dissect)</p>
<p>The internal meningeal layer of the dura mater forms inwardly projecting folds (dural infoldings) that serve as incomplete partitions of the cranial cavity. Three of these folds (cerebral falx, cerebellar tentorium, and cerebellar falx) extend inward between parts of the brain. These infoldings must be cut to remove the brain. The order of dissection will be as follows: The brain will be removed intact, along with the arachnoid mater and pia mater. The dura mater will be left in the cranial cavity.</p>
<p>Dissection Instructions</p>
<p>In the midline, use your fingers to gently retract one cerebral hemisphere 1 or 2 cm laterally and observe the cerebral falx between the cerebral hemispheres. The cerebral falx is attached to the crista galli at its anterior end and the cerebellar tentorium at its posterior end.</p>
<p>Use your hand to gently lift the frontal lobes (anterior part of the brain) and use scissors to incise the cerebral falx where it is attached to the crista galli. This incision should connect the anterior ends of the two parasagittal incisions.</p>
<p>Use scissors to cut the cerebral veins where they enter the superior sagittal sinus so that the veins will remain on the surface of the brain. Grasp the cerebral flax near the crista galli and pull it superiorly and posteriorly from between the cerebral hemispheres. Posteriorly, the cerebral falx will remain attached to the cerebellar tentorium.</p>
<p>On the right side, gently lift the occipital lobe (posterior part of the brain) and observe the cerebellar tentorium. Beginning anteriorly, use a scalpel to cut the cerebellar tentorium as close to the bone as possible.</p>
<p>Sever the cerebellar tentorium from the posterior clinoid process and then from the superior border of the petrous part of the temporal bone. The cut should continue to the posterolateral end of the superior border of the petrous part of the temporal bone, near the grove for the sigmoid sinus. Repeat the cut on the left side of the cadaver.</p>
<p>Pull the cerebral flax and cerebellar tentorium posteriorly from between the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum. This procedure will tear the great cerebral vein.</p>
<p>With the dural infoldings detached, the brain may be gently moved to expose the cranial nerves and vessels that are located on its inferior surface.</p>
<p>Use your fingers to gently elevate to frontal lobes.</p>
<p>Use a probe to lift the olfactory bulb from the cribriform plate on each side of the crista galli.</p>
<p>Use a scalpel to cut the following structures bilaterally: optic nerve, internal carotid artery, and oculomotor nerve. Cut the stalk of the pituitary gland in the midline.</p>
<p>Raise the brain slightly higher and cut the following structures bilaterally: trochlear nerve, trigeminal nerve, and abducent nerve.</p>
<p>Elevate the cerebrum and brainstem still further and cut the following structures bilaterally: facial and vestibulocochlear nerves near the internal acoustic meatus; glossopharyngeal, vagus and accessory nerves near the jugular foramen; hypoglossal nerves near the hypoglossal canal.</p>
<p>Sever the two vertebral arteries where they enter the skull through the foramen magnum and use a scalpel to cut the cervical spinal cord as low in the foramen magnum (or cervical vertebral canal) as you can reach.<br />Support the brain with the palm of one hand under the frontal lobes and your fingers extending down the ventral surface of the brainstem. Insert the tip of your middle finger into the cut that was made across the cervical spinal cord to support the brainstem and cerebellum. Roll the brain, brainstem, and cerebellum posteriorly and out of the cranial cavity in one piece.</p>
<p>Do to certain head and facial surgical procedures, modifications to the harvesting technique may need to be made.</p>
<p>The brain should be stored in a bath of preservative fluid.</p>
<p>Fixation for Fresh Human Brain</p>
<p>Recommended Points Key to Getting Clean Well Fixed Brain Tissue<br />Cradling the brain with both hands underneath, gently dip the brain up and down 4-5 times in a bucket of water.</p>
<p>Allow excess water to drain from the brain before re-dipping in fresh water.</p>
<p>Change water and repeat dipping series.</p>
<p>Drain the brain again.</p>
<p>Suspend washed brain with a string under the basilar artery in a bucket containing 20% neutral buffered formalin for 3-5 days.</p>
<p>After 3-5 days, remove the brain from the first 20% neutral buffered formalin solution.</p>
<p>Use a clean bucket and re-suspend brain in 2nd fresh 20% neutral buffered formalin solution.</p>
<p>Fix for an additional minimum of 30 days.</p>
<p>Storage of multiple brain specimens in the same container is encouraged; as the specimens will be placed in common holding tank after initial examination upon arrival is completed.</p>

To provide hope for Veterans suffering from diseases that currently lack cures or effective treatments, VA actively supports the use of animals in research, teaching, and testing.

<DESC>The Department of Defense's (DoD's) Medical Chemical Defense Science and Technology Research Program is strategically managed by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and executed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) and the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD).  The Medical Chemical Defense Research Program (MCDRP) focuses on the prevention of, and the provision for, chemical warfare agent casualties.  The Department of Defense's Advanced Developer of chemical medical countermeasures is the Chemical Biological Medical Systems Joint Project Management Office (CBMS).  Their combined mission is to protect the soldier against any chemical threat requiring a medical response.  These efforts contribute significantly to the readiness and sustainment of the DoD's warfighting capability.  Success on the future battlefield will depend heavily on the presence of a superior medical technology base that can respond rapidly with required countermeasures to emerging health hazards.  The combined efforts of these DoD assets provide the expertise to meet the challenges of the future battlefield.  Advances in military medicine also lead to important breakthroughs in civilian medicine and public health. <br>  <br> Contract W81XWH-11-D-0002 was issued on a competitive basis with a 3-year base period, and two, 1-year option periods.  The awardee for this award is Battelle Memorial Institute.  The Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) award was issued to establish a contractual agreement with a chemical surety capable research facility for services performance on a task order basis.  The task order contract was appropriate due to the unspecified number of research efforts for which the Government would need such a facility to augment DoD capability.  In the interest of program continuity, the Government reserved the right to independently fund general overhead costs for chemical surety program maintenance as the initial task order.  Use of Chemical Agents at Contractor-Owned/Contractor-Operated (COCO) Facilities is covered under Army Regulation (AR) 50-6, Chemical Surety.  See website: http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/r50_6.pdf.  <br>  <br> Task Order 0001 was issued to Battelle Memorial Institute in April 2011 with a 3 year performance period.  The service support for the chemical surety operations performed under this task order is currently managed by the Joint Project Manager Medical Countermeasure Systems (JPM-MCS).  In order to complete current research being supported by the chemical surety program, Task Order 0001 requires an extension of the 3-year term through December 31, 2014.  Current chemical surety operations must continue without Interruption, and remain compliant with AR 50-6, until transition of the services to a Government activity can be completed.  As required by FAR 16.505(b)(2), a written limited sources justification and approval will be completed to extend the term of the task order through December 31, 2014. <br>  <br> All responses to this Notice of Intent are due by no later than 3:00 PM EST on January 25, 2014.  <br>  <br> The POC for this action is: <br> Scot Plank <br> Phone Number: 410-417-2821 <br> E-Mail Address: scot.b.plank.civ@mail.mil

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840

Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 72 days before your offer is evaluated.

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>Title: Scientific and Technical Data Analysis Services</p>
<p>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-(SSSA)-14-041 and the solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72, dated January 2, 1014.</p>

<p>(v) Scientific and Technical Data Analysis Services</p>
<p>(vi) The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has a requirement to provide data analysis services for the Section's PET and quantitative autoradiographic studies. The National Institute on Mental Health Section on Neuroadaptation and Protein Metabolism (SNPM) has developed a fully quantitative method for measuring rCPS with L-[1-11 C] leucine and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The method was validated in rhesus monkeys by direct comparison of PET results with those from quantitative autoradiographic and biochemical methods. Subsequently, SNPM has performed PET studies to measure rCPS in healthy human subjects in the awake state and under protocol sedation, in subjects with Fragile X Syndrome (FrX) studied under protocol sedation, and in healthy subjects who were sleep deprived and studied while awake or during sleep (studies in progress). The SNPM is planning to conduct further PET studies in healthy subjects during sleep and memory consolidation, and in FrX subjects who can be studied awake or under an alternative sedating agent that does not alter rCPS in these subjects. SNPM is also conducting quantitative autoradiographic studies in rodents in order to measure rCPS in animal models of Fragile X Syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and other single gene disorders associated with a high incidence of autism. SNPM plans to conduct autoradiographic and small animal PET studies in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease. The animal studies are an integral part of the Section's research program; each animal study is the preamble to a planned clinical study, and each clinical study informs the next animal study.</p>
<p>The contractor will provide data analysis services for the Section's PET and quantitative autoradiographic studies. The contractor will advise the Government Principal Investigator on optimal methods of analysis and will independently perform the requisite analyses. The contractor will furnish all necessary labor, material, supplies, and &bull;equipment other than a computer workstation. The contractor will also provide training of any laboratory personnel who have the necessary mathematical and computational background to learn to perform analyses for future studies. The contractor will provide a data report for each PET or autoradiographic study analyzed. As each study is completed, the contractor will provide an interim summary report covering all subjects or animals in the protocol. A final summary report will be delivered upon completion of all studies in the protocol.</p>

 The venue must be capable to provide lodging to all participants and provide sufficient meeting spaces and facilities, equipment, and materials necessary to perform the tasks as defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  

UNLESS AVAILABLE VIA Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) THE OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND INCLUDE A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WITH THEIR PROPOSALS; REFERENCING APPLICABLE NAICS AND SIZE STANDARD STATED ABOVE:
The following FAR clauses/provisions are applicable to this requirement: FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications  Commercial Items, FAR 52.222-22 Previous Contracts and Compliance Reports, FAR 52.222-25 Affirmative Action Compliance, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required Implementing Statutes or Executive Orders  Commercial Items, with reference to 52.219-4, 52.219-28, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.222-39, 52.222-50, 52.223-9, 52.225-1, 52.225-13 and 52.232-33.
 Addendum to 52.212-4 includes DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation.  52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items 

The following factors will be used to evaluate offers.  In determining the overall value of the quote, cost is equally as important as technical but more significant than past performance.
 
Factor 1:  Cost
Factor 2:  Technical 
	Subfactor 1: Technical Approach
Subfactor 2: Management Approach
Factor 3:  Past Performance

Factor 1  Cost:    
When evaluating the price quote, a determination will be made as to the Offerors price reasonableness, completeness, realism, and consideration of the total room night revenue associated with the conference.  The Offerors quote must demonstrate reasonable pricing that is aligned with the technical approach and management approach.
  Price will not receive an adjectival rating. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes on the total price for the basic requirement (location, lodging accommodations, meeting rooms and support, morning and afternoon light refreshments, and the Ice Breaker social). 

Factor 2  Technical

Subfactor 1  Technical Approach:  The Offeror shall demonstrate an understanding of the requirements and describe, in detail, how it will meet the requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS), specifically section 3.0.  The Offerors technical approach must demonstrate the necessary skills, knowledge, and capabilities to successfully perform all tasks in the PWS.  

The Offerors quote will be evaluated based on its technical approach including detailed deliverables and performance standards as defined in the PWS.
  The Offeror shall respond to full compliance of each item listed under section 3.0 of the PWS and address the ability to meet the desired delivery requirements defined in the PWS.  NO PRICING IS TO BE PROVIDED IN THE TECHNICAL APPROACH. 

Subfactor 2 - Management Approach:  The Offerors quote must demonstrate the ability to provide a management plan for execution of all of the tasks in the PWS, with the ability to execute all tasks within the specified timeframes. The Offeror must also demonstrate that they have assessed the potential risks associated with its technical approach and management plans, and will provide a plan to mitigate identified risks.  The management structure and approach will be evaluated in terms of its adequacy and effectiveness to deliver the PWS requirements supported by the Offerors explanation in detail.
 The Offerors demonstrated capability to field a multi-disciplined team with knowledge, skills and abilities across the full spectrum of the requirement.

Factor 3  Past Performance:  

Past performance information shall be provided in order to develop an Offeror's past performance rating. 
 
Past performance information is one indicator of an Offerors ability to perform the Task Order successfully.  In the evaluation of an Offerors past performance, the Government reserves the right to use relevant performance within the past five years.  Relevant and timely past performance information in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), and the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) (http://www.ppirs.gov/) including the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) will be considered during the evaluation of an Offerors past performance.
  

Using the Past Performance Matrix (as listed in Section J), the Offeror shall provide a separate list of relevant contracts that were performed within the last five years.  Contracts that are listed in PPIRS are preferred.  The list for the Offeror shall contain no more than seven relevant contracts.  The identified relevant contracts shall focus on performance that is relevant to the current solicitation requirement. Relevancy includes similarity of service/support, complexity and dollar value.  With respect to relevancy, more relevant past performance will typically be a stronger predictor of future success and have more influence on the past performance confidence assessment than past performance of lesser relevance.
  If the Offeror has no relevant past performance within the last five years or cannot provide a list of relevant contracts, then the Offeror must provide an explanation.

Past Performance Questionnaires (as listed in Section J) only apply to relevant contracts for which performance information is not available through PPIRS.  The Offeror shall submit the Past Performance Questionnaire to all of their references listed on the Past Performance Matrix that have NO PPIRS contracts, and shall request the references to complete the Past Performance Questionnaire and return it directly to:
 
Contracts Department
4072 North Jackson Road
Suite 118, Christine Owens/Omar Roque, Code 0230
Indian Head, MD 20640-5115
 
Past Performance Questionnaires may also be emailed to  christine.owens@navy.mil with a cc to Omar.roque@navy.mil  which is the PREFERRED METHOD OF DELIVERY.

Failure to address any of the instructions within this combined synopsis/solicitation may result in a quote being considered unacceptable.
  The Government will make a best value determination based on these factors.  Intent is to award based on initial offers.  If considered necessary by the Contracting Officer, discussions will be conducted only with those Offerors determined to have a reasonable chance for award.  Parties responding to this solicitation may submit their quote in accordance with their standard commercial practices (e.g. on company letterhead, formal quotes form, etc.) but must include the following information:

Responses to questions submitted, if/as appropriate, will be responded to via an amendment to the solicitation.<br />4. Below are the submittal requirements that must be included in the offeror's package.<br />FACTOR I: Technical Approach<br />The offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates the offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW and the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated. The offeror must provide an overview of unique technologies, applications or software that are incorporated into their products. Offeror must describe how their proposal/products will support high demand cyclic periods of production.</p>
<p>FACTOR II: Past Performance<br />The Offeror shall provide at least two (2) examples of contract and/or projects for which they have provided high speed production and office print device services from within government agencies or commercial entities within the three (3) years. The offeror must describe the nature and scope of the contracts/projects and include dates of performance as well as the dollar value of the contracts/projects. The following information, if applicable, must be provided: Each example of experience shall include: <br />a. Name of client<br />b. Contract Title/Number<br />c. Period of Performance<br />d. Approximate dollar value of the contract<br />e. Brief description of the overall goal of the contract<br />f. Brief summary of the Offeror's success in reaching the stated goal and<br />g. Name and telephone number of the customer, if Government experience, provide the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Representative;<br />FACTOR III: PRICE <br />a. The offeror shall provide the following:<br />b. The offeror must provide both a unit price and an extended price for each priced contract line item number (CLIN); <br />c. A price breakdown of the proposed total price of each performance period (Lease Year I, Lease Year II and Lease Year III.)<br />EVALUATION <br />In accordance with FAR 12.6, the Government will award a FFP contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the three (3) evaluation factors: Factor 1: Technical Approach, Factor II: Past Performance and Factor III: Price. Factor 1 is more important than Factor 2. The non-Price factors when combined are significantly more important than Factor 3 Price. However, price will become significantly more important as non-price factors approach equality. The price analysis will be conducted in accordance with the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical features. <br />The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussion with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />Proposals will be evaluated using FAR 15.4 evaluation procedures, and rated as either Technically Acceptable or Technically Unacceptable. <br />&bull; Technically Acceptable - Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />&bull; Technically Unacceptable - Proposal clearly does not meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Factors <br />FACTOR I: Technical Approach<br />The government will evaluate the oferrors quote which demonstrates the offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW and the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated. The Government will evaluate the offeror's ability to provide an overview of unique technologies, applications or software that are incorporated into their products. The government will also evaluate the offeror's ability to describe how their proposal/product supports high demand cyclic periods of production. <br />FACTOR II: Past Performance<br />The Government will conduct a past performance assessment based on the quality, relevancy and currency of the offeror's past performance as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort. Relevancy is defined as an effort that the offeror performed as a prime or a subcontractor that has a logical connection with the effort required by this solicitation. Currency is defined as work that was performed for at least twelve (12) months in the three (3) years prior to the due date of this RFP. The source of information regarding past performance, the context of the data and general trends in performance may also be considered. A significant achievement, problem, or lack of relevant data in any element of the work can become an important consideration in the source selection process. Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the past performance assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily contact all of the sources provided by the offeror, it is incumbent upon the offeror to explain the relevance of the data. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving good past performance rests with the Offerors. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably. <br />FACTOR III: Price <br />The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b). No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate price. <br />III. TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

  (a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services.  The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights-
    (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and
    (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract.
  (e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.
  (f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.

      (iii) Contract number, contract line item number and, if applicable, the order number;
      (iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of the items delivered;
      (v) Shipping number and date of shipment, including the bill of lading number and weight of shipment if shipped on Government bill of lading;
      (vi) Terms of any discount for prompt payment offered;
      (vii) Name and address of official to whom payment is to be sent;
      (viii) Name, title, and phone number of person to notify in event of defective invoice; and

      (x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.
        (A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.
        (B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures.
        (C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.
    (2) Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.
  (h) Patent indemnity. The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, employees and agents against liability, including costs, for actual or alleged direct or contributory infringement of, or inducement to infringe, any United States or foreign patent, trademark or copyright, arising out of the performance of this contract, provided the Contractor is reasonably notified of such claims and proceedings.

    (5) Overpayments. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a contract financing or invoice payment, the Contractor shall-
      (i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the-
        (A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);

The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in Section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, as provided in (i)(6)(v) of this clause, and then at the rate applicable for each six-month period as fixed by the Secretary until the amount is paid.
      (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.
      (iii) Final decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if-

    (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
  (u) Unauthorized Obligations.
    (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
      (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
      (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
      (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
    (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

Current access information may be obtained by calling (253) 967-1733.  As of 15 January 2002, the following requirements apply.  Commercial vehicle access to JBLM-Main will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) on Monday through Friday.  This gate will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2000 hours.  The Logistics Center Gate is closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays).  On Saturdays and Sundays, commercial vehicles must use the DuPont Gate (Exit 119 from I-5).  DuPont Gate hours are 0530 hours until 2000 hours.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Joint Base Lewis-McChord.       (1) If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.     (2) Large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5" clearance) will require a time stamped "searched" label to gain access to JBLM-North.  "Searched" labels will be issued at the Logistics Center Gate or the DuPont Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to Joint Base Lewis-North must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5" in height and that they will require access to Joint Base Lewis-North.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a "searched" label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to Joint Base Lewis-North.     (3) Commercial vehicles less than 12'-5" in height shall access Joint Base Lewis-North ONLY via the Pendleton Avenue under-crossing once they are cleared through the Logistics Center Gate or the DuPont Gate, as appropriate. <BR> <BR>THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO ASSIST YOU, AND WILL HELP TO EXPEDITE PAPERWORK AND PAYMENT.
     a. Only one delivery will be accepted against each line item.  Backorders will NOT be accepted on individual line items.     b. Deliver on or before date specified.  Deliveries will be accepted Monday through Friday (except Holidays) from 7:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. to Block 15 of the Purchase Order.  Notify the individual in Block 16 of any delay encountered (due to strikes, factory backorders, etc.)  and give revised delivery date if possible.     c. Mark outside of all cartons.  Put packing list inside cartons.  Show the order number assigned, the PR number shown at the end of each item, and the quantity shipped.  All items will be identified by the part number by attached tag and/or stamped identification.     d. On direct shipments, have the supplier or manufacturer cite our order number on packages.  This eliminates delay caused by trying to determine the firm awarded the original order. <BR> <BR>Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the contractor shall obtain any necessary licenses and permits, give all notices, and comply with any applicable Federal, State, County, and municipal laws, codes, and regulations in connection with this award. <BR> <BR>The Contractor will appoint an IMO to be the liaison between the Contractor and Government communication personnel.

<p><strong>(1) TECHNICAL:</strong> The following sub-factors are listed in descending order of importance.</p>
<p><strong>Sub-factor 1:</strong> Relevant technical experience, knowledge of industry and<br />sector;</p>
<p><strong>Sub-factor 2:</strong> Work plan, including strategy for evaluating risks, financial viability, and U.S. export potential (including U.S. sector competitiveness) of projects;</p>
<p><strong>Sub-factor 3:</strong> Relevant experience in evaluating and developing international projects, including experience drafting Terms of Reference/budgets for studies and experience with relevant financing mechanisms;</p>
<p><strong>Sub-factor 4:</strong> Knowledge of country and/or region, including relevant foreign language skills; and</p>
<p><strong>Sub-factor 5:</strong> Quality of Proposal, including quality of writing and organization.</p>
<p><strong>(2) PAST PERFORMANCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>(3) PRICE</strong></p>
<p>All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important that cost or price.</p>
<p>Technical and Past Performance shall be evaluated using the adjectival ratings in Attachment 2 of this solicitation.&nbsp; The Government will evaluate price to determine the following:</p>
<p>&bull; <strong>Completeness:</strong> All information required by the solicitation has been submitted and is accurate.</p>
<p>&bull;<strong> Reasonableness:</strong> The Government will conduct a price analysis to determine whether the proposed prices are fair and reasonable. This determination may be accomplished by one or more of the techniques set forth in FAR 15.404-1(a)(b)(2).</p>
<p><strong>No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.<br /><br />15. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD:</strong> The Government will use Best Value Source Selection Procedures to evaluate offers and determine the best value. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitations requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by this solicitation) and is determined, based on the evaluation factors, to represent the best value to the Government. The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives USTDA the greatest confidence that it will best meet or exceed the requirements affordably. This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Contracting Officer reasonably determines that the technical approach and/or superior past performance of the higher priced offeror outweighs the cost difference. The Contracting Officer will make an integrated assessment based on the evaluation factors described above.</p>

<p>Design services required will be in conjunction with environmental compliance type projects, including preparation of drawings, specifications, estimates, and schedules. A-E services shall include capability to respond to emergency chemical/petroleum spills for containment and/or removal, emergency air sampling, and hazardous waste/material identification and removal. A-E services shall have ability to coordinate emergency responses with local authorities (Local Fire Departments, Hazardous Material Teams, State and Federal Agencies, etc). Various types of A-E Services such as site and/or building investigation, inspection, and testing (air, drinking water, asbestos, lead, PCBs, etc), preparation of studies and reports may also be needed as related to project design. A-E services shall have ability to complete remedial investigations and clean-up, according to all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations, if necessary.

Special attention should be given to the ability to complete Hazardous Material/Waste Database Entry and reporting into Enterprise Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health Management Information System (EESOH-MIS) and Air Quality Database entry and reporting into Air Program Information Management System (APIMS). Firms will be evaluated against this database requirement. Firms without this experience should be prepared to demonstrate ability to meet this requirement. Special attention also should be given to a proximity requirement. Due to the nature of site conditions and the potential for events requiring critical response, the Government reserves the right to require the contractor to respond within 2 hours to emergency requests. Firms should be prepared to demonstrate ability to meet the emergency response time.</p>
<p>The Government intends to issue a firm fixed-price Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a five year ordering period. The selected firm must negotiate hourly rates for anticipated disciplines, reproduction, overhead, profit, and other elements. Projects will be issued to the contractor by task orders. The minimum amount to be issued under the contract will be the value of the first task order. The maximum order amount will not exceed $4,500,000 over the five year ordering period.</p>
<p>This solicitation is being issued on a Total Small Business set-aside basis. For information, the NAICS code relevant to this procurement is 541330 with a small business size standard of $14,000,000 average annual revenue.</p>

<p>Completed SF330s received in response to this notice will be evaluated by a government board in accordance with Public Law 92-582 (Brooks Act), Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.6, and supplements thereto in order to determine the most highly qualified firms. Failure to provide the requested data or accessible points of contact could result in a firm being considered less qualified.</p>
<p>Offeror's must be registered in the SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT (SAM) database to receive a contract award. If the Offeror does not become registered in the SAM database within 4 days after receiving notification from the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>The A/E firms will be evaluated in accordance with the following selection criteria:</p>
<p>(1) PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS. Evaluators will award up to 20 points based on their judgment of the depth and experience of the firm and other firms submitted as part of the team as well as the professional qualifications of their staff and other firm staff submitted as part of the team.</p>
<p>SF 330, Part I, Block E, should show brief resumes of key personnel of the firm/teaming arrangement. The combination of criteria below will be used to determine the ability of the staff to be effective innovative and contribute to the successful completion of project task orders. Responses will be evaluated to determine personnel:</p>
<p>a. Education<br />b. Training<br />c. Project Experience<br />d. Professional Registration of Key Personnel</p>
<p>(2) SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE. Evaluations will award up to 15 points based on specialized experience of the firm's staff to the typical requirements that may be generated as part of this statement of work and the firm's demonstrated success in specifying the use of recovered materials in construction, and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design.</p>
<p>SF 330, Part I, Block F, list only current projects or projects completed in the past five years. Projects completed more recently will be evaluated more advantageously for the offeror. These projects should show scope and nature similar to the RRS Statement of Work (Attachment Number 2), the complexity of the job, challenges faced, actions taken and the resolution and results of any challenges faced, as well as identify any key personnel in Section G that worked on the projects and their role.</p>
<p>SF 330, Block H should clearly identify the firm's demonstrated success in specifying the use of recovered materials in construction and remediation, and achieving waste reduction, pollution prevention, and energy efficiency in environmental compliance, remedial and facility design. The contractor should also identify if the prime or its associates have at least one Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Accredited Professional as defined by Green Building Council. The contractor should also identify LEED awards and ratings achieved by the firm and its associates.</p>
<p>(3) CAPACITY FOR TIMELY ACCOMPLISHMENT OF WORK. Evaluations will award up to 10 points to judge the capacity of the firm to accomplish the requirement in the statement of work. Within the SF 330, Part I, Block H, each firm shall demonstrate how they will manage, coordinate, and administer the work within the prime and among any teaming partners. Teaming partners to be included by the prime contractor should be clearly identified in their response as such for evaluation purposes and will later be agreed to during negotiations of any resultant contract. SF 330 Blocks C and F may also be evaluated to support this criterion. SF 330, Part IIs shall be provided for the specific prime office expected to lead this effort and teaming partners proposed to perform the work. In Block 9c(i), enter the total number of employees for the firm and in Block 9c(2) enter the total number of employees for this office.</p>
<p>Responses will be evaluated to determine the following requirements:</p>
<p>a. Capacity to perform work in-house;<br />b. Ability to support concurrent projects;<br />c. Ability to manage, coordinate, and administer work within prime and among teaming members;</p>
<p>(4) PAST PERFORMANCE. Evaluations will award up to 30 points based on evaluation of past performance of the firm with respect to their execution of the projects listed in the firms SF 330, both Government and private. Reports of completed DoD contracts listed in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) public access web page located at https://www.fapiis.gov/fapiis/govt/fapiispubaccessmain.jsp will be reviewed for performance on Government contracts. FAPIIS provides users access to integrity and performance information from the FAPIIS reporting module in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and suspension/debarment information from the Excluded Parties List system (EPLS). FAPIIS Public Access will only display integrity, performance, and proceeding information entered on or after April 15 2011. Anything earlier will be verified on the CPARS page at http://www.cpars.gov/. SF 330, Block H. cite examples of performance and customer satisfaction such as recognition for technical achievements, cost savings, or commendations received by your team for projects similar to the scope of work. Responses will be evaluated to determine:</p>
<p>a. Ability to maintain cost, schedule, and quality;<br />b. Customer satisfaction</p>
<p>(5) LOCATION. All firms responding to the synopsis will be considered. However, evaluators will award up to 10 points based on the firm's knowledge of the locality (Rome, NY), local environmental laws and regulations, and the firm's ability to respond to the site for urgent or time-sensitive matters.</p>
<p>(6) VOLUME OF DOD WORK. Evaluations will consider the volume of work previously awarded to the firm by DoD and will award up to 5 points with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DoD contracts among qualified A-E firms, i.e., firms with a greater number of contracts or volume of work should be awarded less points and vice versa. SF 330, Block H should clearly identify, in table format similar to SF 330, Part II, Block 11, the volume of DoD work. SF 330, Block 11a, where Federal Work is written, firms should enter DoD volume only. Amounts should represent the total amount of any DoD contract vehicle in which obligation of funds has occurred in the previous five (5) years from the date of this announcement.</p>
<p>(7) KNOWLEDGE/EXPERIENCE OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND GREEN DESIGN. Evaluations will consider the knowledge and experience with in-use environmental compliance government programs and use of green design in the environmental compliance, remedial and facility design arenas and will award up to 10 points based on the firms past experience with these specific items.</p>
<p>(8) INTERVIEW/DISCUSSION. The Final Selection Board will award up to 20 additional points to the three highest scoring firms, as determined by the Pre-Selection Board. These 20 points will be awarded on response to questions from Final Selection Board members. All firms that advance to the interview stage will be provided with interview questions. All firms will receive the same set of questions before the interview appointment.</p>
<p>TEAMING AGREEMENTS. The prime contractor shall provide a statement in the cover letter confirming executed teaming agreements are in place for all team members on proposal. The statement shall also list all team members.</p>
<p>Evaluation of past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified. Selection of the A-E firms for these contracts will be based on the following evaluation factors. Not all evaluation factors are of equal weight, with variations from 5 to 30 points. The Pre-Selection Board will use the factors from Criteria 1 through 7 to determine the firms that will be recommended to the Final Selection Board. The Pre-Selection Board will recommend to the Final Selection Board the three highest scoring firms. The Final Selection Board will also use the factors from Criteria 1 through 7 to score the firms recommended by the Pre-Selection Board. The Final Selection Board will further evaluate these firms based on interview/discussion and record their scores from Criteria 8 (worth 20 points). These scores will be added to the previous subtotals to arrive at a total point value that will determine the order of recommending the preferred candidates to the contracting officer.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) will be utilized for contractor performance reporting. The contractor selected for award must have a valid DoD PKI certificate. Refer to http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil for more information.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 66027 intends to negotiate a sole-source purchase order from AudioCARE INC for expanded service of their patient appointment reminder system.  Currently, there is a sole source DOD-wide contract in place with AudioCARE INC for telephonic patient reminder services.  Each Military installation or Military Health Center has the option to add additional modules for their specific needs.  These additional modules are provided by AudioCARE and are required to tie back into the base AudioCARE workstations, software, and overall automated system.  Since AudioCARE's system is proprietary, they are the only authorized provider of these additional modules.  The specific modules that are being requested by Munson Army Health Center are: 1. License renewal for the two workstations that provide backup pharmacy ordering service, 2. Text messaging patient appointment reminder in addition to the existing phone call option, 3. An appointment canceling service Providers can utilize to notify all patients of a cancellation.  <br>  <br> This is an amendment to the earlier synopsis to clarify some details, and to add an additional module. <br>    <br>  This is a sole source procurement under Acquisition of Commercial Items (FAR 12), and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES, however; any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Office by 1200 Central Time on 13 JAN 14.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements listed above.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government.  If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the sole source procurement.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Daniel.Gustke@us.army.mil.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.     <br>

<DESC>This amendment extends the response date for this solicitation to Wednesday, February 19, 2014 at 4:30 PM MT.  Sometime during the week of January 13, VIPR 6.1 will be istalled making the VIPR system unavailable for an estimated day and a half.  You can view the changes made in this update at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/solicitations.php under Solicitation Template Modifications.  A current problem that will be fixed in this update is that when a vendor responds "Yes" to a yes/no question, the Yes shows up in the VIPR application, but the quote and any printed document shows it as "No."  In addition, a new wage determination will be incorporated in this install.  Although none of the wage rates changed, the health and welfare benefit rate increased slightly.  It is currently $3.71/hr, $148.40/wk, $643.07/mo and will increase to $3.81/hr, $152.40/wk, $660.40/mo.  If you have already submitted a quote and don't feel the need to change it, you do not need to re-submit it.  If you have not yet submitted your quote, you might want to wait until VIPR 6.1 has been installed so you are looking at the most current version of the solicitation.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to change the venue and increase the number of representatives from each company that may participate in the onsite session.  The change to the announcement is as follows: 
Due to overwhelming interest in vendor/contractor desire for on-site participation, the total number of available onsite spaces for contractor personnel to physically meet onsite has increased from 75 to 175, while the 200 available Adobe Connect lines available remains unchanged.  Due to limited space described in the initial posted invitation and first amendment, the venue has now changed. The new venue is only located approximately  mile from the initial location. Please see below for updated time and location. 
As with the first amendment, each company is still authorized to register only ONE representative for on-site participation and/or ONE Adobe Connect line (there are no prohibitions on how you utilize your Adobe Connect connection; i.e. multiple participants in a single conference room are permitted). Each form of registration is on a first-come, first-serve basis.

INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY PARTICIPATION IN A JOINT PRESOLICITATION CONFERENCE AND INDUSTRY DAY PERTAINING TO CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT SERVICES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA) VA ACQUISITION ACADEMY (VAAA)
CROSS-REFERENCE VA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) # VA119-13-I-0131

BACKGROUND: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC), is providing an invitation to interested contractors to attend and participate in a prepared Pre-solicitation Conference and Industry Day presentation pertaining to curriculum development services on Wednesday January 22, 2014.  The presentation of information and the subsequent submission of feedback/comments from industry is considered an exchange of information before receipt of proposals (FAR 15.201).  The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain quality supplies and services, ascertain reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.
A full day agenda is being planned whereby the SAC and VAAA intends to share its strategic goals, priorities and objectives.  The intended acquisition strategy of developing both short-term and long-term VA acquisition-related curriculum development services will be discussed. Additionally, the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) has been invited to speak about initiatives as it relates to Small Business (e.g. teaming arrangements, etc.), and representation from the Office of General Counsel (OGC) has been invited should any questions/issue arise (i.e. during question and answer sessions, etc.).  An agenda will be provided to registrants at a later date.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:  The Veterans Affairs Acquisition Academy (VAAA) was created in 2008 to address the growing acquisition workforce challenge facing the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Federal Government overall. There are five (5) professional schools that belong to the VAAA: Project/Program Management School (PM School), Supply Chain Management School (SCMS), Facilities Management School (FMS), Contracting Professionals School (CPS), and Acquisition Intern School (AIS).  The VAAA intends to develop a multiple-award vehicle for curriculum development for the five schools listed above.  This requirement includes the scope of instructional design, release management, content development, delivery facilitation and instruction, and train-the-trainer activities.  Due to the vision and commission of each of the schools within VAAA, VA requires, and the Contractor(s) shall furnish, continuous Curriculum Development services for training acquisition personnel enterprise-wide.    VAAA intends to do this in a two-step manner:
Step 1: Presently, three schools (CPS, FMS, and SCMS) require separate contract vehicles to both (a) ensure coverage to prevent a potential lapse in service and (b) align strategic program timelines until a larger strategic, more comprehensive five-school contract vehicle is established.  
Step 2: In the near future, all five schools require a longer-term comprehensive and strategic contracting vehicle, currently being contemplated as a multiple-award IDIQ-type contract.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED.<br />Work to be performed under construction project P-100/P-099 Nuclear Power Training Facilities, JB Charleston, SC includes the construction of a new Support Systems Complex (SSC) that will provide pure water (DI) production, controlled pure water (CPW) production, compressed air low pressure (ALP) production, and an oily water separation (OWS) system.  While the project constructs new systems to provide these services to the ships, they are required to connect to and integrate with existing systems that will not be replaced.  This requires fittings that allow the connections to happen without extensive modifications to the existing systems.  Exception to full and open competition is under authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c) for use of proprietary materials of brand name products peculiar to specific manufacturers, namely Hansen Products (Hansen), and OPW Engineered Systems (OPW).  The Government intends to identify this component through specific language in the specifications and on the drawings which will be included as a part of the RFP package for this project.  This J&amp;A authorizes and approves the government requirement for a name brand component.</p>
<p>3.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES.<br />The work under this Construction Contract includes construction of a new berthing pier extension and an SSC to provide necessary utilities to the training ships.  The existing systems and the existing ships must connect via hoses to the new systems, which need to have compatible fittings in order to make the distribution system function as designed.</p>
<p>Estimated Dollar Value<br />The estimated cost of the proprietary items is approximately $1,954.05.  The following proprietary materials will be procured as part of the procured Construction Contract for NPTU, JB Charleston, SC:<br />ITEM				Description	Quantity<br />Hansen		<br />DI Quick Disconnect Fittings	HK Series, 1"	3 ea<br />CPW Quick Disconnect Fittings	HK Series, 1"	3 ea<br />ALP Quick Disconnect Fittings	ST Series, 1"	8 ea. <br />ALP Quick Disconnect Fittings	ST Series, 2"	4 ea. <br />OPW 	<br />OWS Dry Disconnect Fittings	Epsilon, 3"	3 ea.</p>
<p>4.	STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The statutory authority for this acquisition permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one source or limited sources, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Full and open competition need not be provided for when only one responsible source is capable of satisfying agency requirements" and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5.	RATIONALE JUSTIFYING USE OF CITED AUTHORITY.<br />The existing DI and CPW hose quick disconnect fittings at the facility are Hansen Quick Disconnect HK series.  These components are used for connecting the DI and CPW site distribution systems with the training ships via flexible hoses.  The existing OWS dry disconnect couplings at this facility are Epsilon Dry Disconnect Couplings manufactured by OPW Engineering Systems.  These components are used for connecting the OWS site distribution systems with the training ships via flexible hoses. The existing ALP hose quick disconnect fittings are Hansen Quick Disconnect ST series connectors.  These components are used in the maintenance activities for the training ships.<br />All site hoses used for a specific system must be identical for hose compatibility, procurement, maintenance, and testing reasons.  In addition, Norfolk Naval Shipyard performs all maintenance on the ships and the fittings for the site must match the equipment and hoses from the shipyard in order to maintain compatibility with the maintenance equipment used for the ships. Using alternate products would require replacing disconnects on site hoses and valve stations at locations beyond the scope of this project as well as replacing expensive maintenance equipment or purchasing additional equipment to allow critical ship maintenance activities to be performed.  This would result in a significant amount of rework and duplicate costs to the Government.  Furthermore, an extensive modification to the existing systems would create unnecessary downtime and costs for this these mission critical systems.</p>
<p>6.	DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO SOLICIT OFFERS FROM AS MANY OFFERORS AS PRACTICABLE.<br />The proposed action will be synopsized via a Government Point of Entry (GPE) as sole source procurement for proprietary equipment.  A sources sought synopsis was not issued as only specific manufacturers (Hansen and OPW) can provide the proprietary products necessary to fulfill these requirements.  In accordance with FAR Part 5.102 (a) (6) and FAR Part 6.305, Availability of the Justification (c), the approved justification will be posted with the solicitation.</p>
<p>7.	DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST.<br />The government estimate has been developed using a quote utilizing historical data, RS Means and the supplier commercial prices.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the price for this acquisition is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>8.	ACTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO FUTURE COMPETITION.<br />This is a one-time procurement action.  The total proprietary items will be competitively procured.  No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition are to be conducted by this agency.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>1.	CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.<br />The agency is the United States Navy; the contracting activity is Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Jacksonville, FL.  The contracting office is the IPT South Central (IPT SC), Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida.</p>

<p>6.	DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO SOLICIT OFFERS FROM AS MANY OFFERORS AS PRACTICABLE.<br />The proposed action will be synopsized via a Government Point of Entry (GPE) as sole source procurement for proprietary equipment.  A sources sought synopsis was not issued as only a specific manufacturer (Stanley) can provide the proprietary products necessary to fulfill these requirements.  In accordance with FAR Part 5.102 (a) (6) and FAR Part 6.305, Availability of the Justification (c), the approved justification will be posted with the solicitation.</p>
<p>7.	DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST.<br />The government estimate has been developed using a quote utilizing historical data, RS Means and the supplier commercial prices.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the price for this acquisition is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR Part 15.<br /> <br />8.	ACTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO FUTURE COMPETITION.<br />This is a one-time procurement action.  The total proprietary items will be competitively procured.  No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition are to be conducted by this agency.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>1.	CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.<br />The agency is the United States Navy; the contracting activity is Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Jacksonville, FL.  The contracting office is the IPT South Central (IPT SC), Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED.<br />Work to be performed under construction project P-100/P-099 Nuclear Power Training Facilities, JB Charleston, SC includes construction of a new electrical distribution system including new substations and distribution feeders that connect into the existing base-wide distribution system and provide service to the new and existing ships and facilities.  Exception to full and open competition is requested under authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c) for use of proprietary materials of brand name products peculiar to specific manufacturers, namely Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL).  The Government intends to identify this component through specific language in the specifications and on the drawings which will be included as a part of the RFP package for this project.  This J&amp;A authorizes and approves the government requirement for a name brand component.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES.<br />The work under this construction contract includes construction of a new berthing pier extension with two new and one replacement electrical substation as well as a new express feeder route from the Base electrical distribution system along Redbank Road to the site to provide redundant electrical supply to the site in support of the site.  The system ties into the base-wide distribution system and must have protection from backfeeding when testing the generators on the site and the power plants on the ships.  In order to accomplish this, protection relays are being installed.  These protection relays are manufactured by SEL that are considered proprietary items.<br />Estimated Dollar Value<br />The estimated cost of the proprietary items is approximately $7,000.  The following proprietary materials will be procured as part of the procured Construction Contract for NPTU, JB Charleston, SC:<br />ITEM				Description	Quantity<br />Main breaker protection relay	SEL-351S	2 ea.<br />Pier breaker protection relay	SEL-751A	2 ea.</p>
<p>4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The statutory authority for this acquisition permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one source or limited sources, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Full and open competition need not be provided for when only one responsible source is capable of satisfying agency requirements" and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. RATIONALE JUSTIFYING USE OF CITED AUTHORITY.<br />JB Charleston presently uses SEL relays in the substations and feeders on the Naval Weapons Station.  For dependability and security for the electrical distribution system on the Naval Weapons Station, it is imperative that multiple computerized or "smart" relays use the same communication protocol and software to ensure the highest level of dependability for continuation of electric power and protection from cyber attacks.  Cyber security is enhanced when all relays use the same software as software updates are easier to implement across one platform and password protocols are more likely to be understood and used.  Furthermore, electrical maintenance personnel have been trained on how to use and maintain this make of relay.  The procurement of any other make of relay would put an undue burden on JB Charleston maintenance personnel in terms of time and cost to be trained on another make of relay.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO SOLICIT OFFERS FROM AS MANY OFFERORS AS PRACTICABLE.<br />The proposed action will be synopsized via a Government Point of Entry (GPE) as sole source procurement for proprietary equipment.  A sources sought synopsis was not issued as only specific manufacturers (Hansen and OPW) can provide the proprietary products necessary to fulfill these requirements.  In accordance with FAR Part 5.102 (a) (6) and FAR Part 6.305, Availability of the Justification (c), the approved justification will be posted with the solicitation.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST.<br />The government estimate has been developed using a quote utilizing historical data, RS Means and the supplier commercial prices.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the price for this acquisition is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR Part 15. <br /> <br />8. ACTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO FUTURE COMPETITION.<br />This is a one-time procurement action.  The total proprietary items will be competitively procured.  No actions to remove or overcome barriers to competition are to be conducted by this agency.</p>

<p>4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Only one source or limited sources," as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. RATIONALE JUSTIFYING USE OF CITED AUTHORITY.<br />The NPTU site is a military installation located within an active Department of Defense (DOD) explosive safety arc.  It supports military training operations for the U.S. Navy's nuclear propulsion program and other DOD operations.  The site will remain operational and occupied by DOD military and civilian personnel during the construction period.  It is imperative that the utmost military site security control be maintained at all times, especially during the construction period when there will be access by outside personnel and construction crews. The existing security system at the site is currently based on a proprietary LENEL system that is equipped with Intrepid sensors, PELCO closed circuit television stations, and Endura interface systems.  To avoid any actual security gaps or potential security breaches, the integration of new security components into the existing system must be carefully scheduled and monitored by site security personnel to provide for a seamless transition and integration into the existing electronic surveillance system.  The installation of any new IDS and ESS components must also be scheduled for installation and testing by trained security personnel.  The site security personnel are trained to detect and respond to known technical issues with the existing systems, and are versed in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) installation procedures to minimize downtime and avoid system crashes.  Experience with prior system maintenance has demonstrated that integration of other brand name system components requires additional downtime, which in this instance may result in untenable security compromises inconsistent with the required DOD security requirements for the nuclear site.  Other brand names will not meet the agency requirements in this particular instance.  The limited proprietary specifications are required to ensure continuity of military operations, enhance the protection of life safety, and maintain the required national security posture of the NPTU nuclear program platform.</p>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Contracting Office Amarillo Network Contracting Activity 18, located at 6010 Amarillo Blvd West, Amarillo TX 79106 proposes to enter into a firm-fixed price contract on the basis of other than full and open competition for the emergency repair to the Steam Coil for Air Handler 17 at Thomas E. Creek Medical Center in Amarillo, TX The 2237 # is 504-14-2-6132-0501

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This procurement action is awarded as a firm fixed price purchase order to MMM Plumbing, 87 Fannin, Amarillo Texas, 79106, 1-806-376-9797 to provide emergency repair to the Steam Coil for Air Handler 17 at Thomas E. Creek Medical Center in Amarillo, TX.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: The requirement is to provide emergency repair to the Steam Coil for Air Handler 17 that serves the Basement of building 29 and Endo.  This will include, but not limited to provide new Steam Coil and all parts and labor to replace coil. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c) (2), as implemented by FAR 6.302.2.

	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  As M&O Manager, I was notified on Tuesday, 07 January 2014, at approximately 8AM by the chiller plant operator on-site that there was a leak from air-handler 17.  Steam condensate was flooding the Mechanical Room and the unit had to be placed in "valve-off" position. Finding the leak allowed M&O to isolate and minimize impact to a more expanded area.  M&O determined the coil has been previously repaired several times, and, this time, busted in the middle and could not be repaired.  Hence, to accomplish nothing would have resulted in the entire hospital HVAC system being impacted since all the steam would have drained from this particular failure.  Thus, this mechanical failure also impacted Engineering's ability to control the temperature of the air moving throughout the system.  This emergency situation required immediate action to secure a qualified contractor to repair the unit.  M&O first call was to the Contracting Office to ask for any suggested suppliers, possibly VISN-wide.  Amarillo Engineering's office maintains a list of vendors that are used upon smaller repairs, but I was sure this would exceed the micro-purchase limits; so I asked for further assistance.  Thomas E. Creek Medical Center (AVAHCS) has worked with MMM Plumbing in the past, and has had excellent service.  MMM Plumbing has always been very responsive and produced high quality workmanship. MMM Plumbing was physically located, via phone, for a quick response and available to come out immediately.  Until this repair is done we have no means of adjusting the temperature for the basement of building 29 and Endo.  This is the sole heating and cooling system for that area.  The sole vendor selected, MMM Plumbing, has the capability to provide all necessary parts, labor and software in the short turnaround time that is required to repair this system.   

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  FedBizOps Posting:  The requirement was not synopsized in accordance with 5.202(a)(2), because of the unusual and compelling urgency. The Government would have been seriously impacted by the damage of flooded buildings if the agency complied with the time periods specified in 5.203.                                        

Efforts to Solicit Other Potential Sources:  As stated previously, Engineering keeps a list of vendors that are able to respond to smaller and more common demands based on our experience and knowledge of maintenance and repair requirements for HVAC systems.  Over the micro-purchase level, I knew there were considerations of vendor size and ratings that would have to be considered.  Thus, I called Mr. Miller in contracting for assistance. Further market research was not conducted due to the urgency of the situation.  
Future Acquisition Strategy & Efforts:  As M&O Manager I am responsible for maintaining a comfortable and safe environment. It is impossible to anticipate every possible situation that may arise.  My efforts to promote more competition in the future will be to continue to seek local vendors who can be responsive to our needs.  Further Market Research can be done to identify possible small businesses in the area.
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The Government's initial estimate for the work to be performed is $35,000.00. Recently the coil on a smaller size unit that served the CLC needed to be replaced.  The price of that coil was $22,000.00 to replace.  Based on the technical experts experience and on local/current market conditions I declare that these two requirements are similar in scope and level of effort.  This project however requires some electrical hook ups to or energy management system for controls that the other project did not require.
 
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Extensive market research was not conducted because of the criticality of this Air handler.  The requirement cannot be competed because the service is needed immediately to repair the unit.  MMM Plumbing has a complete staff of HVAC mechanics that are licensed and certified to perform this work.  They were also available to respond immediately when the mechanical failure occurred.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Delay in award could possibly cause additional problems with the facility heating and cooling system. The water/air is circulated through the entire HVAC system, and any changes to that system result in air balancing issues and poor control of temperature in adjacent areas.  This system is the sole heating and cooling system for the basement of building 29 and for Endo.  With temperatures being below freezing at night and in the high 30's/low 40's during the day, we must get this replaced ASAP to prevent other failures from the extreme cold temperatures around AVAHCS.   

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  N/A

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required.   N/A

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
