Electronic procedure will be used for this solicitation. 
To: L-3 COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION, SIMI VALLEY, CA.,93065-1650. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
Based upon market research, the Government is not using policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested parties may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.  
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR  6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering  agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. First article test may be required. This part required engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part.  Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s).  The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part.  An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.  The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.

<CONTACT>Harvey S. Bass, AURA Contracts Officer, Phone 520-318-8445, Fax 520-318-8500, Email hbass@noao.edu
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />CS-001 <br />Advanced Technology Solar Telescope Project Mirror Coating Services
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA) in support of the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST) is seeking information on mirror coating services and the properties of currently available enhanced protected silver reflective coatings for use in the ATST. AURA and the ATST Project are currently constructing this four meter aperture solar telescope on Haleakala in Hawaii under contract to the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit AURA to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Responders are advised that AURA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) and the ATST website. It is the responsibility of the potential responders to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>2.1 The ATST will be the world's most powerful solar observatory, poised to answer fundamental questions about the basic processes which govern variations in solar activity. ATST will provide a revolutionary new window on the solar magnetic atmosphere and will be the primary scientific tool for understanding the impacts of variations in the solar output on the Earth's climate. Solar astronomers will use ATST to understand what causes solar eruptions and provide the knowledge necessary to develop space weather forecasting, necessary for protecting or mitigating the potentially devastating societal and economic impacts of solar flares and mass ejections on the nation's space assets, the power grid and communication systems. Funding for the construction of the ATST is being provided by the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>2.2 The ATST optical design contains nine relay mirrors up to one meter aperture that will require protected enhanced silver coatings. In addition to their initial coating, it is expected that these mirrors will require many re-coatings over the 40 year life of the telescope. The frequency of re-coating will depend on environmental conditions on the summit, science use of the telescope, quality of coatings and other factors that will be established as experience is gained operating on the summit. There is also the possibility that a re-coating may be necessary due to accidental damage to the surface of a mirror. The nominal plan to provide optical coating maintenance is to transport these mirrors to a preselected vendor for recoating.</p>
<p>2.3 The relay mirrors feed instruments including polarimeters that operate from 0.38&mu;m to 28&mu;m. In order for those instruments to meet their science requirements, the transmission of the relay mirrors must be high and polarization signatures need to be minimal. For this reason, a protected silver coating, with overcoat designed to maximize short wavelength reflectivity is desired.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>3.1 Responders should provide a description of the currently available protected enhanced silver coating(s) that could be applied to the ATST relay mirrors. Specific characteristics of interest are listed below.</p>
<p>3.1.1. Theoretical (modeled) reflectivities over the wavelength range 0.38&mu;m to 28&mu;m including reflectivity in the plane of incidence (Rp), reflectivity perpendicular to the plane of incidence (Rs), and the phase difference between the two reflectivities (&delta;) over the wavelength range and for an angles of incidence (AOI) including at least near normal (&le;10&deg;) and 45&deg;.</p>
<p>3.1.2. Measured coating performance including at least Rs and Rp over the wavelength range &le;0.38&micro;m to &ge;0.9&micro;m for at least 45&deg; AOI.</p>
<p>3.1.3. Durability in terms of reflectivity degradation with time due to exposure to observatory, laboratory or similar environments.</p>
<p>3.2 Responders should provide a description of the facility where the coating work will take place. This should include descriptions of equipment, processes used and approximate volume of the specific coating(s) recommended that are applied per year.</p>
<p>3.3 Responders should provide an estimate of the cost and schedule required to provide initial coating and recoating service. Factors that impact the cost and schedule should be discussed such as required lead times, support and handling fixtures, optical surface size and shape.</p>
<p>4.0 Responses</p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.</p>
<p>4.2 White papers in PDF or Microsoft Word compatible format are due no later than 14 February 2014, 17:00 MST. Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to the ATST Contracting Officer, Harvey Bass, at the following email address hbass@noao.edu. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. Please be advised that all submissions become AURA property and will not be returned. If any responder requires a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to be in place prior to submitting a white paper, please contact the ATST Contracts Officer to receive an AURA NDA sample.</p>
<p>4.3. Section 1 of the white paper shall provide administrative information, and shall include the following as a minimum:</p>
<p>4.3.1. Name, mailing address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact.</p>
<p>4.3.2. Copies of any executed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).</p>
<p>4.3.3. Business type (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a)-certified small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, very small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based upon North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 333314 - Optical Instrument and Lens Manufacturing. "Small business concern" means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR part 121.</p>
<p>4.4 Section 2 of the white paper shall answer the issues addressed in Section 3 of this RFI and shall be limited to 20 pages.</p>
<p>5.0 Discussions<br />AURA representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential responders. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability.</p>
<p>6.0 Questions<br />Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to the ATST Contracting Officer, Harvey Bass, at the following email address hbass@noao.edu.</p>
<p>7.0 Summary<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY to identify sources that can provide mirror coating services for the ATST using protected enhanced silver coatings. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on AURA. AURA has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought.</p>

<a href="mailto:Iris.R.Walter@nasa.gov">Iris  Walter</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement to further the expansion of the Regional Visualization and Monitoring System (SERVIR) in the Himalaya region. NASA/MSFC seeks to continue the SERVIR project with its implementing partner for the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region and continue the development of science applications and tools, strengthen hub infrastructure and improve Geospatial Information Technology (GIT) capabilities in member countries, conduct training and capacity building, and execute other activities aligned with those delineated in the work plan. &lt;p&gt; NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD).	Competition is impractical for the following reasons: &lt;p&gt; 1. ICIMOD is based in Kathmandu, Nepal and has been operational since 1983. ICIMOD is a regional knowledge development and learning center serving the eight regional member countries of the Hindu Kush-Himalayas  Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan. ICIMOD supports regional transboundary programs through partnership with regional partner institutions, facilitates the exchange of experience, and serves as a regional knowledge hub. As such ICIMOD satisfies the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)s requirement for an established regional institution. &lt;p&gt; 2. USAID has already made a significant investment in the infrastructure at ICIMOD with the installation of USAID funded equipment (hardware and software) to build capacity to satisfy the technical requirements. &lt;p&gt; 3. Funding was provided to NASA from USAID under a Participating Agency Program Agreement (PAPA). USAID approved ICIMOD for hosting and operating the SERVIR-Himalaya system, and supports continuation of ICIMODs engagement. &lt;p&gt; 4. This procurement serves as a follow-on to Contract No. NNM10AA18C. An immediate start is necessary to avoid an interruption of activity and unrecoverable schedule and project implementation impacts. &lt;p&gt; 5. SERVIR is a high-visibility project at NASA/MSFC, NASA/HQ and USAID.  It is also a model implementation of the Global Earth Observation System of Systemsa multinational effort to build an earth observation system. This level of visibility further supports the need to continue engaging an institution such as ICIMOD that is well recognized in the geospatial community. &lt;p&gt; The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  &lt;p&gt; Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Friday, December 6, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. &lt;p&gt; Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. &lt;p&gt; All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. &lt;p&gt; NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	. &lt;p&gt;

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for the necessary extension of the current contact for Facility, Operation, Repair, and Maintenance services (FORM) at the NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio 44135.	The work effort includes preventive maintenance; Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM); emergency, urgent and routine trouble calls; minor service requests; operation of the centralized steam plant and outlying boilers; operations and maintenance of high voltage electrical distribution systems; operations and maintenance of fire, security and safety alarms and systems; operations and maintenance of HVAC systems and equipment; structural maintenance; repairs and minor modifications; and snow removal. NASA/GRC intends to purchase these services from Call Henry, Inc. due to a GAO protest of the follow-on award. This procurement action is being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement. A modification to the existing contract is intended in order to avoid disruption of O&M services as well as to provide continuity of services and avoid unacceptable delays and significant cost to the Government; an award to other than Call Henry, Inc risks the degradation of the structural integrity overall facility operating systems, and Life safety systems. The performance period for this extension of Facilities, Operations, Repairs and Maintenance (FORM) services will be no longer than six months beginning on December 1st, 2013. The value of this extension is estimated not to exceed $9 million. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.    Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 25, 2013.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 5.203(a)(1), this is notice of a proposed sole source Purchase Order to ANSI in support of Consistent Field Operations, Field Operations Group Operational Guidelines Training Delivery and Implementation Assistance. The services required to meet the Agency?s technical support needs include: 1) providing training to Agency organizations on the FOG Guidelines; 2) conducting assessments of organization?s current field quality management systems against the FOG Guidelines; and, 3) providing consultation to organizations to develop or modify their field management systems to be compliant with the FOG Guidelines. The nature of the acquisition supports other than full and open competition, since the requirement involves continuous improvement, quality management systems based on ISO standards, except that the ISO 17025 standards are designed for stationary, controlled environments, analytical laboratories, and not uncontrolled, non stationary field activi ties. It is necessary that the contractor has demonstrated this expert knowledge by serving as an accrediting authority that has certified ISO 17025 compliance for organizations that conduct environmental field activities. Also the requirement is immediate and any other accrediting authority would have to invest quite a bit of time to understand the differences between the traditional laboratory analyses and conducting environmental field activities. ANSI has been the accrediting authority certifying two EPA field organizations? compliance with ISO 17025 standards.  ANSI has accredited the National Enforcement Investigations Center since 2001, and the Region 4 Science and Ecosystem Support Division since 2008.

The HELSR probes differ from PCR primers in that they recognize targets on the same strand and barcodes that are used that are specifically resilient to failure with Illumina and IonTorrent sequencing errors. This technology allows the recognition of target template and the formation of the barcoded ligation product only in the presence of template and this critical step is separated from an amplification step. The result is a library that contains only the intended targets to be amplified greatly increasing signal to noise. Specifically analysis software is used to demultiplex large sequencing runs consisting of hundreds of samples and tens of millions of reads and output the results in as little as two hours. Hundreds of probe sets can be screened at a reduced cost allowing us to test many more possible target probes and thereby maximizing the efficiency of probe performance in the final assay.   <br>  <br> Minimum Requirements Specifications: <br>  <br> The contractor must have (1) experience working with NGS data and analysis for rare sequences present at 0.1%, (2) be able to differentiate sources of error arising from the sample itself, sample preparation, sequence data generation and sequence data analysis, (3) have experience differentiating explicitly, ambiguous, informative and non-informative reads. (4) have successfully developed non-human specific enrichment assays for NGS data generation focused on single base SNPs on Illumina and Ion Torrent platforms and the data analysis (low density marker assay) and (5) have demonstrated viral sub-species detection from complex clinical samples using the specific enrichment assays for NGS data generation. The staff at CGS, USAMRIID will guide the development of the work by providing pathogen information, publically available (GenBank) sequence databases and lists of prioritized targets to the contractor.    <br>  <br> THE SOLICITATION DOUCMENT, W81XWH-14-R-0009, WILL BE RELEASED ON OR BEFORE TUESDAY, 26 NOVEMBER 2013, FINAL SOLICIATION RESPONSES WILL BE DU E PER THE TERMS OUTLINED IN THE SOLICIATION DOCUMENT.

<DESC>&nbsp;Part 1: General Instructions
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) requests the following information for planning purposes in accordance with FAR 15.201(e):</p>
<p>a) The Government is seeking information from potential sources possessing the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for the design, development, test, production, installation, integration, and sustainment of a KC-46 Maintenance Training System (MTS).</p>
<p>b) Responses to this notice are NOT considered offers and WILL NOT be accepted by the Government to form any binding contract.</p>
<p>c) Contractors/Institutions responding to this market research survey are placed on notice that participation in this survey DOES NOT ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards.</p>
<p>d) The Government WILL NOT reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.</p>
<p>e) Below and attached are preliminary documents describing an overview of the KC-46 MTS procurement and sustainment strategies.</p>
<p>f) Also provided is a Contractor's Capability Survey, which allows you the opportunity to provide your company's background information and capabilities. The associated questionnaire provides you the opportunity to expound on your understanding of the program requirements and how best to meet them.</p>
<p>g) If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research survey, you should provide documentation that substantiates your company's approach and capabilities in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide appropriate and sufficient documentation may result in the Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack specific experience in any particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome such lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (e.g., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)</p>
<p>h) If your company does not have the capabilities necessary to encompass the entire KC-46 MTSrequirement, but is capable of performing a specific segment of the requirement, respond by providing answers to all questions related to the segment(s) you are capable of performing and how it would be integrated into the overall KC-46 MTS requirement.</p>
<p>i) Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this survey. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are permitted. The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition. Note that, if there is sufficient demonstrated interested and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Note that, if this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>j) All responses to this survey are required to be made in writing (please, NO facsimiles). Written responses should be sent via e-mail andmust be received by the Air Force no later than 11:59 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on 23 December 2013. Please send your e-mail responses to: daniel.andrews@us.af.mil. NOTE: E-mail submittals with file sizes greater than 10Mbs must be broken down into several smaller submittals. Maximum file sizes of 5-8Mbs per submittal are recommended.</p>
<p>k) Questions or requests for clarifications relative to this survey should be addressed via e-mail to the following Government points of contact: daniel.andrews@us.af.mil; thomas.mallets.2@us.af.mil; and joshua.looper@us.af.mil<br /><br /><br />Part 2: Requirements Description</p>
<p>The following part identifies key characteristics, initial requirements, planned activities, and foreseen topics associated with the program being planned. Please note - all information contained in this notice represents the Government's best understanding of the nature of the anticipated acquisition as of the posting date. The information is provided for consideration and planning purposes and is subject to change.</p>
<p>2.1 Program Overview</p>
<p>The primary purpose of a KC-46 Maintenance Training System (MTS) is to provide realistic training to Air Force maintenance personnel who will maintain and support the KC-46A Tanker aircraft. The MTS program will be developed, fielded and sustained concurrent with the KC-46A Tanker aircraft program. The MTS acquisition strategy anticipates an initial seven-year firm fixed price contract (2+ year development phase, a production phase, and 5 one year operations/sustainment options) commencing in 2015. Current estimated program events include: Contract Award -3QFY15, Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Complete- approx. 27 months after CA, 1st Suite Initial Production Start -4QFY16, Standup Annual Operations and Sustainment -1QFY17, Government Military Construction (MILCON) Complete -Feb 2017, On-site Contractor Installation and Verification Testing Complete -Aug 2017, 5-Level Upgrade Ready for Training (RFT) -Nov 2017, 2nd Suite Install -3QFY20 (see Attachment A, KC-46 MTS Acquisition Working Schedule).</p>
<p>The MTS program shall provide the Air Force Using Commands with a "blended" training solution by integrating a mixture of Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI) along with a suite of high-fidelity Maintenance Training Devices (MTDs) augmented with the IMI. The MTS products shall support Government developed and lead classroom instruction as well as instructor-monitored Hands-on training.</p>
<p>Comprehensive maintenance training will be provided by Government instructors to support initial qualification, transition, and continuation training for KC-46A maintenance personnel. The MTS shall introduce required knowledge and skills and allow the students to become proficient in servicing and maintaining the KC-46A aircraft, performing operational checks, and troubleshooting aircraft systems. Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) that will specifically benefit from the MTS are: 2A5X1-Aerospace Maintenance Specialty (Crew Chief), 2A5X3A-Communication/Navigation/Missions Systems, 2A5X3B-Instrument and Flight Control Systems, 2A5X3C-Electronic Warfare Systems, 2A6X1-Aerospace Propulsion, 2A6X4-Aircraft Fuel Systems, 2A6X5-Aircraft Hydraulic Systems, and 2A6X6- Aircraft Electrical and Environmental Systems.</p>
<p>The MTS shall use common software to simulate KC-46A aircraft functionality and shall enable the student to interact with the simulated aircraft systems as they would with the actual aircraft in real-time. The MTDs shall be augmented with IMI capabilities to help students locate components, perform maintenance procedures, observe internal systems responses, and to provide a physical reference/interface for hardware-related tasks. At this time the Government envisions procuring the following types of KC-46 MTS MTDs: Avionics/Cockpit, Flight Controls, Boom/Refueling Pods, Engine/APU, Fuel Systems, and Landing Gear (both Main and Nose). The quantities of devices required will be based upon projected student throughput analysis that is currently being evaluated. The MTS MTDs shall be installed and maintained at each Active Duty KC-46A Main Operating Base (MOB) within the CONUS. Actual MTS MTD locations will be determined through the Air Force's Basing process.</p>
<p>The IMI shall be interfaced to real-time aircraft systems simulation and produce high quality interactive graphics. All IMI products shall be provided in accordance with MIL-HDBK-29612-3A, Development of Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI) (Part 3 of 5 Parts) requirements. IMI products shall include Interactive Courseware (ICW) and the software management tools used in support of instructional programs. The IMI shall be compliant with the latest version of DoD Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) Technical Standards. The MTS courseware shall also be accessible in a self-paced distributed learning capability available via the internet anytime and anywhere. Additionally, the Air Force is investigating the portability and access of IMI capability on commercially available hand-held devices.</p>
<p>All MTS facilities, classrooms, MTDs, and the MTS Training System Support Center (TSSC) shall be networked to facilitate expedient software updates and access to shared IMI data. Additionally, the training network shall be configurable for collaborative training across classrooms and MTDs based upon the curriculum and Government instructor's needs. The MTS shall also be fully Information Assurance (IA) compliant and capable of interfacing with the Air Force's Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS) system as well as Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and Air Mobility Command (AMC) training management/tracking systems.</p>
<p>Under Development/Production phases of the program the MTS Contractor shall be responsible for designing, developing, acquiring, building, integrating, testing, installing, and verifying the MTS in accordance with the requirements outlined in the program Statement of Work (SOW) and System Specification. Immediately following contract award the MTS Contractor will be required to enter into Associate Contractor Agreements (ACA) with both the Aircrew Training Systems (ATS) Contractor and the KC-46A Aircraft Manufacturer to attain all required data outside that data which was originally provided as part of the bidders library. Furthermore, the MTS Contractor will be responsible for Concurrency Management during development (primarily focused on maintaining concurrency with the KC-46A aircraft development changes and any equipment changes/obsolescence issues).</p>
<p>Under the Operations &amp; Sustainment phase of the program the MTS Contractor shall be responsible for: operation and maintenance support for all MTDs and IMI to include reliability and availability performance measures; maintenance of and updates to MTD operations/user documentation; procuring, storing, inventorying, and managing all needed spares, special test equipment and support equipment (to include powered andnon-powered Aerospace Ground Equipment); the staffing and operation of the TSSC; and all MTS Concurrency Change Management (to include concurrency with the KC-46A aircraft, obsolescence issues, technical refresh, software licensing/maintenance, and process improvement recommendations) for the KC-46 MTS.</p>
<p>2.2 Draft Statement of Work (SOW)</p>
<p>Attached is the latest draft version of the KC-46 MTS Program SOW (see Attachment B - Draft 131018v3, KC-46 MTS SOW). This draft SOW defines the current envisioned tasks to be performed by the Prime Contractor in the conductance and execution of the KC-46 MTS Program. The formal Request for Proposal (RFP) will establish the total program work and system performance requirements, both operational and functional, for the KC-46 MTS program.</p>
<p>2.3 Training Systems Requirements Analysis (TSRA) System Requirements Document (SRD)</p>
<p>At this present time and in lieu of a draft MTS System Specification, attached is the AMC approved Initial Acquisition TSRA SRD (see Attachment C - KC-46 MTS Initial TSRA SRD). The SRD outlines the top-level requirements and provides conceptual system definitions and expected performance requirements for the KC-46 MTS based upon the analysis of the initial TSRA activities. The SRD also identifies recommended top level tasks that would be performed on each of the respective conceptual MTDs by projected trainee job series/AFSC.</p>

If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of any potential offeror to monitor FedBizOpps for additional information pertaining to this requirement. <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command - Redstone, on behalf of the Precision Fires Rocket and Missile Systems (PFRMS) Project Office, Program Executive Office Missiles and Space, hereby release this RFI to ascertain the level of interest of potential vendors desiring to contract for the development and production of an improved Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System Missile (GMLRS) Launch Pod.  The Government's intent is to better understand the current, state-of-the-art capabilities and strategies to determine the best solution.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas.  Proprietary information is neither solicited nor prohibited; however, if submitted, it should be clearly and appropriately marked.   <br>  <br> A Request for Proposal (RFP) for this effort may be issued in the future.  The Government is seeking white papers regarding the technical approach to this technology concept and industry's assessment/opinion of the most efficient and cost effective method of executing this effort.  The response should include:   <br>  <br> 1.  A tier one schedule showing events from contract award to delivery of prototypes to the U.S. Government for material and combat developer evaluation. <br>  <br> 2.  A cost estimate (MS Excel file) which includes personnel, hardware, and evaluation support  <br>  <br> 3.  A notional schedule showing events and rough order magnitude cost estimate for a maturation and risk reduction phase leading to a technology readiness level ready sufficient (TRL 6-7) for system integration and qualification.   <br>  <br> Industry is also encouraged to describe the benefits or risks associated with options and recommendations on contracting approaches that provide a best value to the Government while minimizing risk (especially cost risk) to the selected development contractor. <br>  <br> DESIRED CAPABILITY IMPROVEMENTS <br>  <br> The desired capability improvements in a next generation GMLRS Launch Pod are:   <br>  <br> 1.  The new GMLRS Launch Pod shall house six (6) GMLRS rockets.  The physical dimensions of the launch pod (i.e. height, width, length, weight), as well as the mechanical and electrical interfaces, must be compatible with the current M270 series, M142 launchers and existing logistical assets.  The new GMLRS launch pod must be usable with the current family of launchers to avoid the cost of modifying or developing new launchers and to avoid costly changes to current logistical/material handling equipment. <br>  <br> 2.  Meet or exceed performance specification and electrical/mechanical interface control definitions (maintain critical form, fit and function interfaces and performance) with GMLRS munitions,M270A1/M142 launchers and logistical/material handling equipment. <br>  <br> 3.  Increased open system/modularity that enables a partial expended rocket load out six-pack configuration to be reconfigured as a full rocket load out six-pack configuration. <br>  <br> 4.  Maximum survivability, hazard and safety performance that includes system level insensitive munitions design. <br>  <br> 5.  Design shall be flexible/adaptable for future munition configurations with fewer than six (6) rockets. <br>  <br> 6.  The new GMLRS launch pod shall not interfere with a GMLRS rocket acquiring radio frequency signals (such as telemetry and GPS) while housed within the pod. <br>  <br> 7.  The six pack container or modular units of the six pack container is not planned to be reloaded once empty after rocket firings.  <br>  <br> 8.  The six pack container or modular units of the six pack container shall be capable of internal/external health maintenance/monitoring (e.g. shock, vibration, temperature and moisture). <br>  <br> The documents listed below are available for authorized DOD contractors eligible to receive Distribution C and D documents, and will be distributed on a case by case basis.  Appropriate legal and security requirements will be satisfied prior to providing any requested technical data. <br>  <br> Nomenclature:  Rocket Pod <br> Functional Baseline Interface Control Documents (ICDs):  <br> - 13214701 (POD-TO-M270A1 Launcher Interface) Rev Dash  <br> - MIS-48811 (Interface Control Document for the M270A1 Launcher to Munitions Launch Pod Assembly Interface) Rev B <br> - MIS-49157 (Missile Command Specification Interface Control Document for the Rocket Pod, 298MM, M31 Rocket) Rev E <br> - MIS-49257 (Missile Command Specification Interface Control Document for the Rocket Pod, 298MM, M30E1 Rocket) <br> - MIS-49 (Missile Command Specification Interface Control Document for the Rocket Pod, 298MM, M28 Practice Rocket) <br> - Cage Interface Control Drawing ( Document Number 13027605 Rev G)  <br> - MIS-52612 (Missile Command Specification Interface Requirements Specification for the Guided Missile and Launching Assembly with Ground Support Equipment ATACMS 2000 with Unitary) Rev C <br>  <br> Allocated Baseline Performance Specification: <br> - MIS-PRF-49xxx (Performance Specification for the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System Unitary Rocket) Rev <br> - MIS-PRF-49xxx (Performance Specification for the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System Alternative Warhead Rocket) Rev <br> - MIS-PRF-49xxx (Performance Specification for the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System Practice Rocket) Rev <br> - MIS-PRF-52607 (System Performance Specification Guided Missile and Launching Assembly, Surface Attack; M57 for ATACMS 2000 with Unitary) Rev D <br>  <br> SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS <br>  <br> Interested sources will provide a white paper describing their recommended strategies.

SCOPE: 
The general scope of this project is to provide design services for the project to Renovate Building 84 for a smoking shelter at the VA Medical Center located in Bath, New York.  Building 84 is a vacant, one story building.  This project shall partition off a portion of the building as required to achieve a smoking shelter that ensures that smoke does not enter adjacent building 78, that has access limited to those designated by VA to utilize the shelter, and that has remote monitoring capabilities for the nurses on the adjacent units and a panic alarm for patients to utilize when in the shelter.  The smoking shelter shall be sized to accommodate approximately eight smokers at any time.

All designs will follow the VA design guidelines, and specifications for VA construction. The design will be completed in a manner such that the estimated construction cost is within the VA budget.  The estimated construction budget is: $300,000.00

EXISTING CONDITIONS

The existing building was constructed in 1952. The building exterior is concrete block. The building consists of a concrete floor slab-on-grade and a flat roof. All floor underlayment is concrete and tiled with 9x9 vinyl tile (VAT). The interior walls are painted CMU. There is currently no dropped ceiling and mechanical systems are exposed. The existing building was most recently used as a wood shop. The building is currently heated with steam. The building is sprinkler protected.

<p>RS is responsible for administering the annual open enrollment period for annuitants participating in the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program, which is the world's largest voluntary employer-sponsored health insurance program, providing health benefits for approximately nine million individuals, of which Federal annuitants and survivors make up almost two million. The FEHB program is authorized by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) of 1959 (5U.S.C. 8901).</p>
<p>There were an estimated 230 health plan options for annuitants to select from during the 2012 Open Season. Total income for the FEHB Program in FY2012 was over $46 billion, and assets as of September 30, 2012, totaled approximately $81 billion. OPM has contracted with health plans since the inception of the program. These contracts cover the period from January 1st of the calendar year through December 31st. Normally, the Summer before the contract year begins, the Federal Employees Insurance Operations and the Actuaries Group negotiate rates in addition to a wide choice of health benefits coverage for eligible employees and annuitants.</p>
<p>RS needs to acquire the services of a contractor to provide printing, distribution, and processing services in support of the annual FEHB and FEDVIP Open Season and other related retirement notices for Federal employees, their dependents and annuitants to be in compliance with the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) of 1959 (5U.S.C. 8901) and the Federal Employee Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) governed by 5 U.S.C 8955(b) and 8985(b) and Code of Federal Regulations 5 CFR 894.</p>
<p>Capability Statement / Information Sought:</p>
<p>Interested businesses are encouraged to respond to this notice. However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required. Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience and/or ability to satisfy the minimum requirements listed below.</p>
<p>Capability Statement Requirements:</p>
<p>OPM is requesting information from vendors who provide services that support administering an employer group's benefits open enrollment period. These services include printing, distribution, and processing services, administrative, technical and customer service support of the following functions:<br /><br />Open Season Processing Services<br />Administrative Support <br />Program Support <br />Printing and Distribution Services <br />Customer Service/Call Center/ WEB/IVR Support<br />Data Transmission and Enrollment Processing Services</p>
<p>OPEN SEASON PROCESSING</p>
<p>Scope. The contractor shall be fully responsible for the printing and distribution of FEHB and FEDVIP materials, data transmission and enrollment processing of annuitants, survivors and dependent requests, including customer service support. Continuity of services must be maintained at the utmost proficiency without interruption throughout the contract period.</p>
<p>FUNCTION: ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT</p>
<p>Scope. The contractor shall be required to provide administrative support to OPM as may be necessary to facilitate and/or support the open season and/or meet the needs of the annuitants/survivors and participating carriers. The contractor must be fully aware that the basic components of the open season process in terms of the number of plans, options and participants, be fluid, and able to change within the period of the contract requiring the Contractor to add or delete records in its data base, identify affected individuals, and complete special mailings, concurrent with completing the other specified tasks within the strict timeframes and with a high level of accuracy. OPM requires quality standards and timeframes throughout this contract be adhered to strictly.</p>
<p>FUNCTION: PROGRAM SUPPORT</p>
<p>Scope. The contractor shall provide key personnel (i.e. Project Manager and Programmer/Computer Analyst) necessary to maintain constant communication between OPM and the contractor. The contractor shall work with RS Staff to plan and coordinate all requirements necessary to support the annual Federal Benefits Open Season for CSRS and FERS retirement programs covering approximately 2 million annuitants/survivors participating in the FEHB and approximately 400,000 annuitants/survivors covered by FEDVIP health insurance benefit programs.</p>
<p>FUNCTION: PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES</p>
<p>Scope. The contractor shall provide management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies and equipment (except as otherwise noted) and shall plan, schedule, coordinate and control all aspects of printing and distributing open season materials to annuitants/survivors. The contractor prints, personalizes, and mails open season materials to annuitants/survivors so that each annuitant/survivor receives health plan information specific to the geographical area in which the annuitant resides. Distribution of materials must be accomplished absolutely within the timeframes specified, so that the annuitant's annuity payments will accurately and timely reflect any health benefits changes requested during the specified period.</p>
<p>FUNCTION: CUSTOMER SERVICE/CALL CENTER/ WEB/IVR SUPPORT</p>
<p>Scope. The contractor shall provide the necessary facilities and customer service personnel to support responding to requests by answering telephones, email inquiries, web chats and written correspondence. OPM is receptive to innovative technologies and methodologies, including processing information and change requests using the World Wide Web with the demonstrated capability of successfully performing the specialized functions and addressing security and privacy issues; and at a minimum a toll-free Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology, Web Chat, Email or other advanced technologies.</p>
<p>FUNCTION: DATA TRANSMISSION AND ENROLLMENT PROCESSING SERVICES</p>
<p>Scope. The contractor shall provide management information system reports (i.e. data collection and data reporting) and will monitor and analyze the quantity and type of processing activity performed by the contractor during the annuitant open season. The data collection requirement is of critical importance to the agency's management of future open seasons. For example, the number of annuitants who changed enrollment to a plan whose brochure they requested is useful information when compared to the number of brochure requests for each plan because analysis of the comparison could indicate future trends in annuitant preference for certain types of health plans. The data collection and data reporting required is of two types: 1) continuous, electronic daily reports during open season processing; and 2) an annual written report after open season processing is completed. The contractor is required to have the capability to provide a current Workload and Processing Report upon request from OPM on any given work day. The following are the all reports required during the contract period.</p>
<p>IVR Statistics Report: Submitted on a weekly basis and captured in the annual written, includes the total number of calls, call duration, total number of early hang-ups, total busy time, total call time, total enrollment changes made through IVR, and other beneficial statistical information.</p>
<p>Open Season Survey Results: Submitted on a weekly basis and captured in the annual written, reports the responses to survey questions relating to customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Reconciliation information: Submitted on a weekly basis, accompanies each transmission to ensure that the number of actions transmitted by the contractor and the number read by OPM are in agreement.</p>
<p>Workload and Processing Reports: Submitted on a weekly basis, the format to be determined after the contract is awarded.</p>
<p>Receipts of written enrollment change requests after the end of the open season (without late authorizations): Submitted at the end of the open season period, includes the number of requests, batched by date of receipt, for each type of request received.</p>
<p>Annuitant Migration Reports: Submitted at the end of the open season period and one at the end of the contract period.</p>
<p>Report of Unprocessed Items: Submitted on a weekly basis, reporting the number of unprocessed action items must be submitted to the COR. The report should estimate the number of pieces of mail on-hand. This estimate should be based on the number of trays of mail or another methodology that has been explained by the contractor and approved by the COR.</p>

<DESC>Background/Objectives

The Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Integrated Services Network (VISN) 11 consists of seven (7) VA Medical Centers and 29 operating Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) which provide comprehensive inpatient and outpatient health care to veterans in eastern Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. VISN 11 is a large and geographically diverse network and covers 90,100 square miles. The VIP network medical centers operate 1812 beds including acute medical and surgical, psychiatric, and nursing home beds.
The Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 11 Cardiology Advisory Group is conducting market research in accordance with FAR Part 10 to assess the current state and capabilities of Picture Archive Cardiology Systems (PACS) currently available in the commercial marketplace. The VISN 11 Cardiology Group has determined the current PAC System implemented in 2009 is out of date and is in need of replacement. The VA is contemplating an effort to replace its current ProSolv system with an "off-the-shelf" system capable of integrating into medical centers VISN-wide. 
Vendor Fair General Information
The fundamental purpose of this event is to conduct market research regarding commercial PACS capabilities. Information obtained through this vendor fair will assist VA in the development of future requirement(s) and/or solicitation(s).
For this specific announcement, the VA is interested in providing a forum where interested vendors can share information and products with VISN 11 Cardiology Advisory Groups and vested stakeholders (e.g. Office of Information & Technology, Bio-Medical Engineering, Information Security Officers, etc). The VA is interested in learning about product(s) that demonstrate vendors' capabilities of providing a system capable of capturing, storing, transmitting, and viewing cardiographic images VISN-wide. Any interested vendor is encouraged to bring computers and display monitors capable of displaying a software demonstration of their system. 

The Government plans to host the vendor fair on December 10, 2013 at the Northern Indiana Healthcare System VA Medical Center located at 2121 Lake Avenue, Fort Wayne, IN 46805. The vendor fair is scheduled to be held in the medical center auditorium. Each interested vendor will be provided space to set up equipment and/or informational displays. During the course of the vendor fair, approximately four (4) to five (5) teams of VA personnel will rotate through each vendor's booth or station for a demonstration and discussions.  The topic of price is NOT to be addressed in any discussions with any VA staff during this vendor fair.
All costs incurred in responding to this announcement and attending the vendor fair will be solely the responsibility of each individual vendor. All materials and equipment, including computers, software, and wireless internet must be provided by each individual vendor. The VA will provide 110AC power outlets for electronic equipment. It should be noted that none of the equipment will be linking to any VA computer or network systems. 
Vendors interested in participating must provide notification to VA Contract Specialist Jared Tritle at Jared.Tritle@va.gov no later than 12pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on December 5, 2013. Any questions must be submitted with the notification sent to the Contract Specialist. Any notifications received after December 5, 2013 12pm EST will not be considered. The VA will confirm your request for participation shortly after the closing date and time.  
Disclaimers and Important Notes

<DESC><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TITLE</span>: Phenotypic Manifestations of Copy Number Variations in 16p11.2, MYT1L, NRXN, 15q13.3 or 22q11.2.
<p><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND<br /></span>The Child Psychiatry Branch (CHP) at the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH), National Institutes of Health (NIH),is interested in the Phenotypic Manifestations of Copy Number Variations (CNV) in 16p11.2, MYT1L, NRXN, 15q13.3 or 22q11.2. in a population of subjects identified by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), Center for Applied Genomics (CAG).</p>
<p>Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) currently has a study population of 100,000 subjects ages 0-21 in the Philadelphia area for which all health care records are online and linked to DNA samples. The study group includes healthy and ill subjects. These subjects represent a wide spectrum of diseases and/or conditions (including healthy controls). The DNA from this subject pool is currently being screened for the presence of CNVs in these 5 loci.</p>
<p>It is hypothesized that CNVs in these loci can have a broad impact on psychiatric, neurological, immunological, and/or other system-wide or organ-specific functions, leading to a wide range of medical pathologies that have not been fully characterized or previously attributed to mutations at these loci. Findings from this study group may provide proof-of-principle to support other related studies to explore the role of pathogenic CNVs in many other regions (~200 loci) across the full ~150K samples in the CAG repository.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</span><br />The purpose of this initiative is to procure additional data and analysis from subjects screened by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, to further identify the range of phenotypic manifestations caused by pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) arising from duplication of the 16p11.2-16p12.2 region and deletions of part or all of the MYT1L,15q13.3 and NRXN genes.</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions - Neurosciences, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)/National Institute on Aging (NIA) Research and Development Contracts Management Branch (R&amp;D CMB), on behalf of the Child Psychiatry Branch (CHP), NIMH, intends to negotiate a procurement with the Department of Psychiatry, Neuropsychiatry Section, at the University of Pennsylvania, on a sole source basis pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements).</p>
<p>The Department of Psychiatry, Neuropsychiatry Section, at the University of Pennsylvania is uniquely qualified to perform this study. The University of Pennsylvania and CHOP are both affiliates of the University of Pennsylvania Health System. No sources other than University of Pennsylvania have the required access to the medical records and the subjects from the CHOP subject population. The University of Pennsylvania has been conducting a pediatric population study involving genetic measures and clinical phenotyping of subjects from the CHOP subject pool. However, more data capture and analysis is necessary. In addition, there are no other known existing pediatric populations and associated databases that can be used for this study. The size and geographic diversity of the pediatric database is extensive and unique, as is the ability to generate the research findings on abnormalities in the development of brain circuitry in CNV carriers.</p>
<p>Since researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, in collaboration with CHOP, have been granted sole access to the unique subject population and database to be used in this study, they are considered the only group that can perform this Project.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</span><br />The Contractor shall further evaluate approximately 150 subjects identified by CAG to further assess phenotypic status, complete data entry, conduct quality control, issue reports, and provide data to the NIMH.</p>
<p>CAG staff has contacted and scheduled participant visits, administered consents, and performed clinical assessments and neurocognitive testing in a population of subjects. The data collected was reviewed in-depth to determine which subjects would be placed in this cohort study to further characterize phenotypic status in the future.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REPORTS/DELIVERABLES </span><br />All reports shall be submitted in electronic form as PC-formatted computer files in Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel and/or searchable PDF format. The Contractor will be required to submit recurring Quarterly Technical Progress Reports, Annual Progress Reports, and a Final Progress Report (including a Summary of Salient Results) to be submitted on or before the last day of the period of performance. This Final report shall include a summation of the work performed and results obtained for the entire contract period of performance. This report shall be in sufficient detail to explain comprehensively the work completed and the results achieved. In addition, the Contractor shall submit various IT Security Deliverables/reports.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the Annual Reports and the Final Report will provide the following types of data on subjects screened:<br />o Rating Scale of Symptoms <br />o Clinical Interview Summaries<br />o Cognitive Battery Test Scores<br />o Anatomical and Functional Brain imaging data when available</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span> <br />The period of performance for this project is estimated to be for three (3) years, from ~June 1, 2014 to May 30, 2017.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS</span> <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Project will be: 541711.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT</span><br />Capability Statement - Respondents to this notice must provide, as part of their responses, a Capability Statement to include the information below: At a minimum prospective Offerors must document capabilities in the following areas: (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.</p>

The DNA from this subject pool is currently being screened for the presence of CNVs in these 5 loci.</p>
<p>It is hypothesized that CNVs in these loci can have a broad impact on psychiatric, neurological, immunological, and/or other system-wide or organ-specific functions, leading to a wide range of medical pathologies that have not been fully characterized or previously attributed to mutations at these loci. Findings from this study group may provide proof-of-principle to support other related studies to explore the role of pathogenic CNVs in many other regions (~200 loci) across the full ~150K samples in the CAG repository.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</span><br />The purpose of this initiative is to procure additional data and analysis from subjects screened by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, to further identify the range of phenotypic manifestations caused by pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) arising from duplication of the 16p11.2-16p12.2 region and deletions of part or all of the MYT1L,15q13.3 and NRXN genes.</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions - Neurosciences, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)/National Institute on Aging (NIA) Research and Development Contracts Management Branch (R&amp;D CMB), on behalf of the Child Psychiatry Branch (CHP), NIMH, intends to negotiate a procurement with the Department of Psychiatry, Neuropsychiatry Section, at the University of Pennsylvania, on a sole source basis pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements).</p>
<p>The Department of Psychiatry, Neuropsychiatry Section, at the University of Pennsylvania is uniquely qualified to perform this study. The University of Pennsylvania and CHOP are both affiliates of the University of Pennsylvania Health System. No sources other than University of Pennsylvania have the required access to the medical records and the subjects from the CHOP subject population. The University of Pennsylvania has been conducting a pediatric population study involving genetic measures and clinical phenotyping of subjects from the CHOP subject pool. However, more data capture and analysis is necessary. In addition, there are no other known existing pediatric populations and associated databases that can be used for this study. The size and geographic diversity of the pediatric database is extensive and unique, as is the ability to generate the research findings on abnormalities in the development of brain circuitry in CNV carriers.</p>
<p>Since researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, in collaboration with CHOP, have been granted sole access to the unique subject population and database to be used in this study, they are considered the only group that can perform this Project.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</span><br />The Contractor shall further evaluate approximately 150 subjects identified by CAG to further assess phenotypic status, complete data entry, conduct quality control, issue reports, and provide data to the NIMH.</p>
<p>CAG staff has contacted and scheduled participant visits, administered consents, and performed clinical assessments and neurocognitive testing in a population of subjects. The data collected was reviewed in-depth to determine which subjects would be placed in this cohort study to further characterize phenotypic status in the future.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REPORTS/DELIVERABLES </span><br />All reports shall be submitted in electronic form as PC-formatted computer files in Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel and/or searchable PDF format. The Contractor will be required to submit recurring Quarterly Technical Progress Reports, Annual Progress Reports, and a Final Progress Report (including a Summary of Salient Results) to be submitted on or before the last day of the period of performance. This Final report shall include a summation of the work performed and results obtained for the entire contract period of performance. This report shall be in sufficient detail to explain comprehensively the work completed and the results achieved. In addition, the Contractor shall submit various IT Security Deliverables/reports.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the Annual Reports and the Final Report will provide the following types of data on subjects screened:<br />o Rating Scale of Symptoms <br />o Clinical Interview Summaries<br />o Cognitive Battery Test Scores<br />o Anatomical and Functional Brain imaging data when available</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span> <br />The period of performance for this project is estimated to be for three (3) years, from ~June 1, 2014 to May 30, 2017.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS</span> <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Project will be: 541711.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought for PLAs Regarding future Solicitation No.: W9126G-14-R-0017 <br>  <br> Title:   <br> Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers Soliciting Comments on the Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) at Fort Hood VOLAR Barracks & Central Energy Plant Renovation, Fort Hood, Texas. <br>  <br> Description:    <br> The Corps of Engineers Fort Worth District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:  <br>  <br> Fort Hood VOLAR Barracks & Central Energy Plant Renovation, Fort Hood, Texas <br>  <br> Project Description includes the design and construction for the whole block revitalization of the west 39000 block, to include Barracks Buildings 39004, 39005, 39006, 39007, 39012, 39013, 39017 and CEP 39015, renovation of laundry facilities in each barracks, replacement of distribution piping, water and sewer lines to all buildings within the west 39000 block, sidewalk replacement, parking lot reconfiguration and reconstruction, and landscaping.  All barracks shall be designed and constructed to house one soldier per room under normal conditions, but the design shall also support two soldiers per room under surge conditions. This project includes the demo of chilled water and steam piping to all buildings supported by the CEP and replacement with a condenser water loop system for ground source heat pumps in the barracks and a heating water loop for domestic hot water.  This project also requires providing 40% domestic hot water with solar for the barracks and solar water heating at the central energy plant for the heating water loop.  Provisions shall be made for future connection of Headquarters Building 39021 and 39022 to the new condenser water loop. <br>  <br> Magnitude of Construction:  Between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00. <br>  <br> Period of Performance:   730 calendar days after Notice to Proceed.  <br>  <br> Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are: <br>  <br>   a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br>   b. The complexity of the project. <br>   c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region. <br>   d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br>   e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects. <br>   f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br>   g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br>   h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).  <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br>   a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br>   b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will <br>  <br>      1.  Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br>  <br>     2.  Be consistent with law. <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br>   a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA? <br>  <br>   b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br>  <br>   c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <br>  <br>   d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area?  Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br>  <br>   e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br>  <br>   f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <br>  <br>   g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br>   h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br>  <br>   i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via e-mail to Andrew J. Nelson, Contract Specialist at andrew.j.nelson2@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 6 December 2013. <br>  <br> Agency/Contracting Office:   <br> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District <br> ATTN: CESWF-CT (RM 2A17) <br> 819 Taylor Street <br> Fort Worth, Texas  76102-0300 <br>  <br> Place of Performance: <br> Fort Hood Army Base <br> Bell County <br> Fort Hood, Texas <br>  <br> Point of Contact: <br> Mr. Andrew J.

This is not a solicitation. <br>  <br> 1) A capability statement expressing interest in this requirement, describing your company and its capability to complete a project of this scope, magnitude and complexity. Include a statement detailing any special qualifications and certifications, applicable to the scope of this project, held by your firm and/or in-house personnel. <br> 2) A statement of your firm's bonding capacity. <br> 3) A statement of your firm's business size and type. <br>  <br> Submit this information to Jani Long, Contract Specialist, via email to jani.c.long@usace.army.mil. <br> Your response to this notice must be received on or before 2:00PM on December 3, 2013. <br>  <br> Summary of Scope of Work: <br>  <br> The reservoir side fish slots will be permanently closed. Closure is performed by using the existing fish slot screens and converting them into fish slot plugs.  The screens will be removed from the slot by the Corps using their existing lifting beam and crane. Once the screens are out of the slot, they are turned over to the Contractor. The Contractor shall strengthen the existing screen legs, line the pervious areas of the screens, and fill the screen with concrete and reinforcing to create a solid plug. Approximately 378 cy of concrete fill is required for the 18 plugs.   <br>  <br> Extend the new concrete above the top of the existing screen framework to facilitate sealing to the side walls of each slot. Incorporate new lifting hardware into the concrete fill and reinsert into the slot using a Contractor-furnished crane. <br>  <br> After the screen plug has been lowered into the slot, deploy divers in the slot to the top of the screen plug. Release the lifting line and place backer rod sealing material in the gap between the plug and the walls of the slot. Push the backer rod material down about 6 inches from the top of the slot plug all around the perimeter. After the backer rod material is in place, the divers shall place a cementitious grout into the slot all around up to the top of the plug. Once the grout has been placed and has hardened, install reinforcing steel into the threaded couplers on the top of the slot plug. Pressure wash the side walls of the slot to remove any biological growth or film in preparation for placing a minimum of 5 feet of tremie concrete on top of the plug. Approximately 324 cy of tremie concrete fill is required for the 18 slots.  <br>  <br> Use a precast insert with an integral bottom form grouted into the bottom of the Wagner Horn slot for permanent closure.  Approximately 54 cy of concrete fill is required for the 18 slots (54 Wagner Horn openings).  A roughly 6-foot tall, 30-inch diameter, precast plug of concrete with integrated reinforcing, bottom form, and grout injection ports is anticipated for this closure. Lower the existing Wagner Horn screen from deck level using the cables that currently attach the screen to the dam. After the screen is removed, pull a new high strength cable and sheave down into the slot conduits using the existing screen attachment cable.  <br>  <br> Divers shall remove the original screen and cable assembly, pressure wash the corrugated inside walls of the conduit, and attach the precast plug to the sheave. Use the new cable to pull the precast plug into the Wagner Horn conduit and seat the integrated form against the roof of the intake tube. The divers shall then pump grout through the form to fill the annular space between the precast plug and the existing interior conduit walls. Once the grout has sufficiently hardened, remove the injection ports from the forms and grind the area smooth while retracting the new cable from the abandoned sheave.  <br>  <br> The anticipated period of performance is July 2014 - March 2015. <br>

<DESC>Notice of Intent
Biomark, Inc 705 S. 8th Street Boise, ID  83702
The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) in Portland Oregon intends to award a fixed-price purchase order under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedure, and FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements" for the acquisition of an antenna array system at Clear Creek, Idaho.  The Idaho Fishery Resource Office is responsible for monitoring and evaluation of the Kooskia NFH spring Chinook production program and the Dworshak NFH summer steelhead production program. The presence of a PIT antenna array in Clear Creek will enhance the ability to estimate adult returns, straying and trapping efficiency. The array must be able to withstand unpredictable high flows infused with debris, both large and small. As such, the array will need to sit within the substrate, not on top of the substrate and be constructed of durable fiberglass coverings to protect the antennas. Biomark stout antenna array systems are the only know array systems that demonstrate high level of success while maintaining interrogation efficiency.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334220, Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing.  The size standard is 750 M.  The Universal Product Code for this procurement is N070.  Any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the USFWS requirements may submit a response no later than 12/06/2013, 1500 PS to be considered.  Responses to this posting must be submitted in writing via e-mail only.  A determination not to compete the described purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government.  Any questions or comments should be directed to Josh Gordon via e-mail at josh_gordon@fws.gov.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.ornl.gov/">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(ORNL), is seeking a commercialization partner for technology using a nanofermentation system to produce high value materials. The ORNL Technology Transfer Office will accept licensing applications through February 24, 2014.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The high cost and limited quantity of many nanomaterials create a barrier to their commercialization because potential end users are reluctant to develop applications for materials when they are not confident the materials will be available in useful quantities at cost competitive pricing. ORNL researchers have successfully expanded the application areas for nanoparticles produced using a novel fermentation method.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">This technology also has broader applications for the production of luminescent materials using fermentation-type processes (to produce non-toxic lighting technology) and the development of metal-oxide, mixed-metal-oxide, and non-oxide semiconductor particles. Another application is for semiconductors such as copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS) and copper zinc tin sulfur (CZTS) that are useful solar cell materials for highly flexible, lightweight solar panels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">In the earlier work, researchers produced large quantities of semiconducting quantum dots of high market value using a bacterial fermentation process that employs chemicals to control bacterial synthesis. The researchers developed a way to control particle size and morphology by a chemical means of modifying the fermentation broth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Potential applications include production of various complex and thin films, solar cells, and other semiconductor applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">This technology was originally developed using federal funds and selected for further development under the laboratory's Technology Innovation Program (TIP). TIP supports technology development using royalties from existing technology licenses to accelerate the market readiness of high potential technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">License applications will be evaluated based on prospective partners' ability and commitment to successfully commercialize the technology, with a preference for United States based businesses and small businesses. If a license is executed, the ORNL researchers developing the technology will be eligible to compete for additional TIP funding to further advance the technology.<br /><br />For additional information and license application, contact Jennifer Caldwell, Group Leader, Technology Commercialization, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 865-574-4180, caldwelljt@ornl.gov.<br /><br />Technology descriptions and related publications may be found at&nbsp;</span><a style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%;" href="http://www.ornl.gov/connect-with-ornl/for-industry/partnerships/technology-licensing/technology-innovation-program/nanofermentation-system">http://www.ornl.gov/connect-with-ornl/for-industry/partnerships/technology-licensing/technology-innovation-program/nanofermentation-system</a><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%;">.</span></p>

<DESC>This special Notice is being released to address requests for information that have been received IAW Sources Sought Notice.

"I wanted to get clarification on which NAICS code is being used for this A/E design project?
The FBO posting has it classified as 541330, but in the text body of the posting, it says 541310.  I would think that given the heavy electrical/communications component of this requirement with all the physical security features in need of the design that 541330 (Engineering) would be the more appropriate of the two NAICS code."

The appropriate NAICS Code for this requirement is 541330.  The inclusion of NACIS code 541310 is incorrect and shall be replaced with 541330.

<SUBJECT>R--Intent to Award: Sole Source Security Services Bridge Contract
<SOLNBR>G14PS00026
<CONTACT>Robin Doyle

<a href="mailto:rsdoyle@usgs.gov">rsdoyle@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey has a need for a bridge task order to maintain current services previously issued under G13PD01121 while a new contract is being awarded separately.  USGS intends to award this four (4) month extension (bridge) Task Order to the incumbent contractor, Coastal International Securitys GSA contract # GS-07F-0352K.
The USGS has determined that there is no other source that can provide the above services (see sole source justification below); therefore, the USGS intends to make an award to Coastal International Security, Inc. for a one month continuation of services.  Vendors may contact the Contracting Officer, kvultaggio@usgs.gov by the response due date indicated on this announcement.   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) considers employee signatures to be Personal Protected Information, and therefore all employee signatures have been redacted. By posting this document, the Contracting Officer attests all appropriate signatures have been obtained.
SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION STATES THE FOLLOWING PART:
JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION FOR FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE (FSS) AWARD (FAR 8.4) 
1.  Contracting Agency and Activity. The Department of the Interior, United States Geological Survey (USGS), Office of Acquisition and Grants (OAG) plans to contract by means other than full and open competition. This document sets forth the justification and approval to award a new bridge contract on a limited source basis as required by FAR 8.405-6.
2.  Nature of Action Being Approved.  Issue a sole source bridge Task Order under the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule to Coastal International Security, Inc., to continue providing existing armed security guard services for a period of December 1, 2013 through March 31, 2014.
3.  Description of Supplies or Services.  Armed security guard services for the USGS National Center in Reston, VA.
4.  Estimated Dollar Value. The estimated dollar value of the four month bridge Task Order is [Dollar values have been redacted ] 5.  Statutory Authority.  The proposed action may be awarded on a sole source basis under the authority of Section 201 of the Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 USC 501) and FAR 8.405-6(b): Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required. 
6.  Rationale Supporting Use of Citation in No. 5.  Coastal International Security is the current contractor that provides the armed guard services under order G13PD01121, which expires November 30, 2013. G13PD01121 was issued as a bridge contract to allow OAG and the USGS program office additional time to complete the competitive follow-on guard services Task Order.  However, due to a Government shutdown and the number of actions still required prior to award, the new award cannot be made prior to the expiration of the current bridge contract. 
Originally, OAG anticipated award of the new competitive Task Order by November 1, 2013, to have the new contractor take over full responsibility of these services as of December 1, 2013.  Having an award in place by November 1, 2013 would have allowed ample time for the required one month transition period between the incumbent contractor and the newly awarded contractor.  However, since an award was not in place by November 1, 2013, due to the government shut down, the USGS now has a need to issue a new bridge Task Order to Coastal International Security.  At first, the USGS contemplated issuing another two month bridge contract through January 31, 2013, but after considering all factors found that a four month bridge contract is in the best interest of the Government. The USGS has a need to issue the bridge Task Order for 4 months to allow ample time for the USGS OAG and program office to perform these tasks while following implemented DOI policy and FAR regulations.  Also, as the current bridge contract expires on November 30, 2013, this does not allow ample time for another contractor, other than Coastal International Security, to perform ramp up services to take over the responsibilities of this requirement.  Coastal International Security is the current contractor performing these services and is the only contractor in the market place that could continue services beginning December 1, 2013 without a lapse.  Any other contractor would need at least a 30 day period to prepare before beginning services.  A sole source bridge Task order to Coastal International Security is needed to ensure there will be no lapse in armed security guard services for the USGS complex in Reston, VA until the procurement for the new competitive Task Order has been awarded.  As a Level IV Federal Facility owned by the GSA, the USGS complex in Reston, Virginia (tenanted by multiple Federal agencies) is required to provide access-screening and armed security guard services for the 103 acre campus 24 hours a day / 7 days a week. A lapse in service would jeopardize the security of the USGS complex and all its residing employees.
7.  Other Information.  The four month bridge Task Order will be issued against Coastal International Securitys existing GSA schedule contract GS-07F-0352K.  
8.  The Efforts to Identify Additional Sources Including the Market Research Conducted. A competitive procurement is in progress.  The bridge contract is required to prevent a lapse in services. 
9.  Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition.  A new competitive contract is in progress.  Due to a time restraint of when the current bridge Task Order ends, Coastal International Security is the only company that can continue performing the guard services without a lapse in service.  All other contractor would need at least a 30 day window before having the ability to fully take over all guard services responsibilities.   10.  Recommendation and Certification from Program Office Based on the above, I recommend this acquisition be conducted on a limited source basis.  I certify that technical data which form a basis for this justification, that are the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel are complete and accurate.

11.  Certifications and Approval from the Contracting Officer:  
a. This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
b. The Contracting Officer has determined the pricing for this requirement to be fair and reasonable as the vendor is providing GSA pricing.  GSA pricing has already been determined fair and reasonable per FAR Part 8.404(d)  Pricing.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Diversity. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Offerors are highly encouraged to complete all Representations and Certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/.

Only CHESS contract holders will be considered. No responses received through this solicitation will be considered. <br>  <br> This requirement is for Flexible PIC Concentrator (FPC) and Physical Interface Cards (PICs) for existing M320 Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) router comprising the theater MPLS network. FPCs house the PICs that connect the router to network media. Each FPC accommodates up to four PICs. The main function of an FPC is to connect the PICs installed in it to the other router components. Physical Interface Cards (PICs) are housed on Flexible PIC Concentrators (FPCs) and physically connect the router to network media. The router supports various PICs, including ATM, Channelized OC-12/STM-4, Gigabit Ethernet, and SONET/SDH interfaces. Up to four PICs install in each FPC. PICs receive incoming packets <br> from the network and transmit outgoing packets to the network, performing framing and line  speed signaling for their media type as required. PICs also encapsulate outgoing packets received from the FPCs before transmitting them. The controller ASIC on each PIC performs additional control functions specific to the PIC media type.  The Government intends to purchase four (4) Enhanced Flexible PIC Concentrators, and seven (7) 8-Port Type2 Gigabit Ethernet IQ2 PICs. <br>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<SOLNBR>AG-6633-S-13-0006
<RESPDATE>100913
<CONTACT>Linda K McArthur, Contract Specialist, Phone 701-530-2010, Fax 701-530-2109, Email linda.mcarthur@nd.usda.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. Solicitation AG-6633-S-13-0006 is issued as a request for proposals (RFP's). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27.
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), North Dakota State Office intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) to small business sources capable of providing abstract, title commitment and filing services for conservation easements. A BPA is a method of filling anticipated repetitive needs. It is not a contract. The Government is not obligated to place any call orders nor is the vendor obligated to accept any orders. For each work assignment, the Government will request title services through the issuance of a BPA call order from those firms that have been awarded BPA's. Individual call orders shall be submitted in accordance with the terms agreed to in the BPA. Government personnel authorized to place call orders under the BPA will be identified on the BPA by name and telephone number. The contractor will be expected to furnish the service in accordance with the terms and conditions of the BPA, without the need for additional paperwork beyond the Statement of Work that accompanies the order.</p>
<p>Updating and/or developing abstracts, issuing title commitment and filing of easement documents will be for conservation easements located throughout the State of North Dakota. The contractor shall furnish all services, including obtaining title insurance from a title company approved by the U.S. Attorney General. The contractor will perform the same services as a commercial transaction, including updating of existing abstracts, creating abstracts (as deemed necessary), preparing preliminary and final title commitments, obtaining deeds and completion of any necessary curative instruments to assure merchantable title to the conservation easement. The Statement of Work is attached to this solicitation. Timely delivery of complete and accurate abstract and title commitments is crucial to the success of NRCS programs. Call order completion dates will vary depending on the phase of services provided. Obtaining abstracts from landowners may take additional time which in turn will affect completion of the updates and issuance of the preliminary title policy. Photocopies requested by NRCS based on title policy exceptions shall be provided to NRCS within 7 calendar days of NRCS request. Timeframes may fluctuate and therefore will be negotiated with the Contracting Officer as deemed necessary.</p>
<p>This is a Total Small Business Set Aside. The applicable NAICS Code is 541191, with a business size standard of $10M.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Abstract and Title Services are being sought for a period of five (5) years with a BPA period anticipated to be October 15, 2013 through October 14, 2018 or upon signature of both parties, whichever is later. The BPA will remain in effect until cancelled by either party.</p>
<p>STANDARDS AND RESPONSIBILITIES: Title Commitment services must comply with the Department of Justice (DOJ) Title Standards 2001.</p>
<p>The Offeror must be 1) knowledgeable of current requirements of North Dakota State Law in connection with real estate transactions and obtaining title clearances; 2) be an approved agent licensed to do title insurance business in the State of North Dakota; 3) use a title insurance company that is on the United States Attorney General's list of approved companies and also approved by the State Insurance Commissioner in order to assure compliance with all state laws, including title insurance reserve requirements; and 4) provide evidence of liability insurance coverage (standard closing protection letter) for errors and omissions in the amount of at least $1,000,000 and fidelity coverage of at least $500,000 on each individual who will perform substantially services in the process of an easement; or provide an indemnification agreement, satisfactory to NRCS, from the title insurance company providing for reimbursement to NRCS for any loss caused by fraud or failure by the attorneys, agents, or employees of the contractor to comply with NRCS' written closing instructions.</p>
<p>The provisions of FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. Offerors must submit a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their offer. In addition, the provisions of FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial items apply to this solicitation and are attached.</p>
<p>EVALUATION PROCEDURES: The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capacity - a narrative of the offer's technical ability to provide personnel with education and experience required to perform the work described in the Statement of Work. Ability to perform in a timely manner and in compliance with performance schedules and quality of work for title work performed. Ability to perform simultaneously on multiple services.</p>

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), located in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Marshall Bioresources, located in North Rose, NY for 200 Gottingen Mini pigs which will be used for medical research.
<p>These animals will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>Sole source determination is made in accordance with:</p>
<p>FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source</p>
<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p>The mission of USU is to provide the highest quality education programs in the health sciences to those selected individuals who demonstrate dedication to a health profession career in the Uniformed Services. As such, it is essential USU provide the necessary training and equipment required for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers and to support our research efforts.</p>
<p>For the past 5 years we have used the Gottingen mini pig to study acute radiation injury. The Gottingen Mini pigs at 4-5 month old weigh about 22 pounds with a width of about 5.5 inches. The Gottingen Mini pig is the smallest mini pig available with limited breeding, high quality microbiological genetic background. For consistency of results, good quality science and to avoid unnecessary experimental repetition, it is imperative that for our studies we continue to use the same strain of mini pigs that we have studies so far. Other strains have different hematological properties and radio-sensitivities. The animals are barrier bred and raised in a special state-of the-art barrier production facilities, and therefore free from any porcine infectious bacterial, viral, or parasitic diseases. In addition, mini pigs other than the Gottingen Mini pigs weigh well above 100 pounds and we do not have the space to house larger animals.</p>
<p>Marshall Bioresources is the only know source that can provided the requested animals.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government. Responses must be received via email (alphonso.simmons@usuhs.edu) by 10:00 p.m. EST on December 22, 2013.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p><br />(1) ACCESSIBILITY OF CONTRACTOR'S FACILITY</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a facility accessible from a navigable waterway at which a ship of the characteristics described in the attached specification can, using its own propulsion, safely arrive, lie afloat and depart at all states of the tide and at any time day or night. The facility and its approaches shall have a minimum water depth of 4.6' and a minimum vertical clearance of 24'6" The facility shall insure 2 (two) additional feet below minimum water depth at the pier per SFLC Standard Specification 0000 section 3.3.2.1.1.</p>
<p><br />(2) ACCESS TO VESSEL</p>
<p>(a) A reasonable number of officers, employees, and associates of the Government, or other prime Contractors with the Government, and their subcontractors, shall, as authorized by the Contracting Officer, have, at all reasonable times, admission to the plant, and access to vessel(s) to perform and fulfill their respective obligations to the Government on a noninterference basis.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall make reasonable arrangements with the Government or Contractors of the Government, as shall have been identified and authorized by the Contracting Officer, to be given admission to the Contractor's facilities and access to the vessel(s) and to office space, work areas, storage or shop areas, or other facilities and services, necessary for the performance of their respective responsibilities and reasonable to their performance. All such above personnel shall be required to comply with all Contractor rules and regulations governing personnel at its shipyard, including those relative to safety and security.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor further agrees, as authorized by the Contracting Officer, to afford to a reasonable number of officers, employees, and associates of bidders on other contemplated work, the same privileges of admission to the Contractor's plant and access to the vessel(s) on a noninterference basis subject to all Contractor rules and regulations governing personnel in its shipyard, including those relative to safety and security.</p>
<p>(3) INDEMNIFICATION FOR ACCESS TO VESSELS</p>

<p>(6) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the contractor at time of award. The contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(7) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p><br />(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on a Contractor Proposal Form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p><br />(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>(8) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p><br />(9) METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each contract line item/CLIN as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule of Supplies/Services as follows:</p>
<p>An item/CLIN may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that item/CLIN have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each item/CLIN may be waived by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar items/CLINS.)</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.212-4 will be returned.</p>
<p>(a) Each invoice shall contain the following information:<br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor<br />(2) Contract or Delivery/Task Order Number/Modification No.<br />(3) Vessel name<br />(4) Name of the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer<br />(5) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price<br />(6) Percentage of completion for each CLIN identified <br />(7) Shipping and Payment Terms<br />(8) Invoice Routing Code (IRC) SFLC-3<br />(9) Annotate on the invoice indicating that the contractor represents a small business for accelerated payment purposes.<br />(10) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number</p>

Therefore, to facilitate payment, the DUNS number shall be recorded on every invoice submitted to the US Coast Guard.</p>
<p>All payments for partial performance rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend progress payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subsequent agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified by the designated billing office and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) as accurate and complete.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration.</p>
<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: "THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER (To be assigned upon contract award).</p>
<p>NOTE: 10% OF THE TOTAL CONTRACT PRICE WILL BE WITHELD UNTIL ALL DELIVERABLES, REQUIRED BY THE CONTRACT, ARE RECEIVED AND ACCEPTED.</p>

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY Clause
  1.  GENERAL
  Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
  2.  ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
  a.  A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
  b.  All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information.  The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program.  The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
  c.  Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance.  National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts.  The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS).  Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
  d.  Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical.  If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth.  Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
  e.  The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
  3.  VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
  a.  Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA.  This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
  b.  VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met.  If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements.  VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.
  c.  Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/ subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/ created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA.  Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization.  Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.
  d.  The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies.  If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.
  e.  The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state.  If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.
  f.  If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.
  g.  If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements.  Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.
  h.  The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.
  i.  The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements.  VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.
  j.  Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval.  The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.
  k.  Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus.  If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
  l.  For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COR.
  4.  INFORMATION SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
  a.  Information systems that are designed or developed for or on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities shall comply with all VA directives developed in accordance with FISMA, HIPAA, NIST, and related VA security and privacy control requirements for Federal information systems.  This includes standards for the protection of electronic PHI, outlined in 45 C.F.R. Part 164, Subpart C, information and system security categorization level designations in accordance with FIPS 199 and FIPS 200 with implementation of all baseline security controls commensurate with the FIPS 199 system security categorization (reference Appendix D of VA Handbook 6500, VA Information Security Program).  During the development cycle a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must be completed, provided to the COR, and approved by the VA Privacy Service in accordance with Directive 6507, VA Privacy Impact Assessment.
  b.  The contractor/subcontractor shall certify to the COR that applications are fully functional and operate correctly as intended on systems using the VA Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC), and the common security configuration guidelines provided by NIST or the VA.  This includes Internet Explorer 7 configured to operate on Windows XP and Vista (in Protected Mode on Vista) and future versions, as required.
  c.  The standard installation, operation, maintenance, updating, and patching of software shall not alter the configuration settings from the VA approved and FDCC configuration.  Information technology staff must also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default "program files" directory and silently install and uninstall.
  d.  Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges.
  e.  The security controls must be designed, developed, approved by VA, and implemented in accordance with the provisions of VA security system development life cycle as outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems, VA Handbook 6500, Information Security Program and VA Handbook 6500.5, Incorporating Security and Privacy in System Development Lifecycle.
  f.  The contractor/subcontractor is required to design, develop, or operate a System of Records Notice (SOR) on individuals to accomplish an agency function subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, (as amended), Public Law 93-579, December 31, 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and applicable agency regulations.  Violation of the Privacy Act may involve the imposition of criminal and civil penalties.
  g.  The contractor/subcontractor agrees to:
    (1)   Comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) and the agency rules and regulations issued under the Act in the design, development, or operation of any system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function when the contract specifically identifies:
      (a)  The Systems of Records (SOR); and
      (b)  The design, development, or operation work that the contractor/ subcontractor is to perform;
        (1)   Include the Privacy Act notification contained in this contract in every solicitation and resulting subcontract and in every subcontract awarded without a solicitation, when the work statement in the proposed subcontract requires the redesign, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals that is subject to the Privacy Act; and
        (2)   Include this Privacy Act clause, including this subparagraph (3), in all subcontracts awarded under this contract which requires the design, development, or operation of such a SOR.
  h.  In the event of violations of the Act, a civil action may be brought against the agency involved when the violation concerns the design, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, and criminal penalties may be imposed upon the officers or employees of the agency when the violation concerns the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function.  For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the contractor/subcontractor is considered to be an employee of the agency.
    (1)   "Operation of a System of Records" means performance of any of the activities associated with maintaining the SOR, including the collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of records.
    (2)   "Record" means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and contains the person's name, or identifying number, symbol, or any other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a fingerprint or voiceprint, or a photograph.
    (3)   "System of Records" means a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.
  i.  The vendor shall ensure the security of all procured or developed systems and technologies, including their subcomponents (hereinafter referred to as "Systems"), throughout the life of this contract and any extension, warranty, or maintenance periods.  This includes, but is not limited to workarounds, patches, hotfixes, upgrades, and any physical components (hereafter referred to as Security Fixes) which may be necessary to fix all security vulnerabilities published or known to the vendor anywhere in the Systems, including Operating Systems and firmware.  The vendor shall ensure that Security Fixes shall not negatively impact the Systems.
  j.  The vendor shall notify VA within 24 hours of the discovery or disclosure of successful exploits of the vulnerability which can compromise the security of the Systems (including the confidentiality or integrity of its data and operations, or the availability of the system).  Such issues shall be remediated as quickly as is practical, but in no event longer than 7 days.
  k.  When the Security Fixes involve installing third party patches (such as Microsoft OS patches or Adobe Acrobat), the vendor will provide written notice to the VA that the patch has been validated as not affecting the Systems within 10 working days.  When the vendor is responsible for operations or maintenance of the Systems, they shall apply the Security Fixes within 7 days.
  l.  All other vulnerabilities shall be remediated as specified in this paragraph in a timely manner based on risk, but within 60 days of discovery or disclosure.  Exceptions to this paragraph (e.g. for the convenience of VA) shall only be granted with approval of the contracting officer and the VA Assistant Secretary for Office of Information and Technology.
  5.  INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE
  a.  For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, contractors/subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks.  This includes conducting compliant risk assessments, routine vulnerablity scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system.  The contractor's security control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems.  A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval.  All external Internet connections to VA's network involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.
  b.  Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA.  These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII.
  c.  Outsourcing (contractor facility, contractor equipment or contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office.  Government- owned (government facility or government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks.
  d.  The contractor/subcontractor's system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA.  Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA's POA&M management process.  The contractor/subcontractor must use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities.  Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the government.  Contractor/subcontractor procedures are subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General.  The physical security aspects associated with contractor/ subcontractor activities must also be subject to such assessments.  If major changes to the system occur that may affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re- authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3.  This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, Contingency Plan).  The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary.
  e.  The contractor/subcontractor must conduct an annual self assessment on all systems and outsourced services as required.  Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the COR.  The government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using government personnel or another contractor/subcontractor.  The contractor/subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost.
  f.  VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/ subcontractor-owned equipment or software on VA's network.  If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract.  All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment.  All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA-approved configuration.  Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches.  Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.
  g.  All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon:  (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/ subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements.  This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.
  h.  Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes.  The options are:
    (1)   Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
    (2)   VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
    (3)   VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
    (4)   Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;
      (a)   The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and
      (b)   Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation.  Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre-approved and described in the purchase order or contract.
      (c)   A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed.  The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.
  6.  SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
  a.  The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures.  The contractor/ subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/ subcontractor has access.
  b.  To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/ subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
  c.  With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information.  Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach.  Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
  d.  In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement.  The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident.  The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.
  7.  LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
  a.  Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information.  If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
  b.  The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach.  The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.
  c.  Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:
    (1)   Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
    (2)   Description of the event, including:
      (a)  date of occurrence;
      (b)  data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
    (3)  Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
    (4)  Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
    (5)  Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
    (6)  Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
    (7)  The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
    (8)  Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
    (9)  Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
    (10)  Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
    (11)  Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
  d.  Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
   (1)  Notification;
   (2)  One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
   (3)  Data breach analysis;
   (4)  Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
   (5)  One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
   (6)  Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.
  8.  SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING
  On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General.  The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.
  9.  TRAINING
  a.  All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
    (1)   Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the  Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;
    (2)   Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually complete required security training;
    (3)   Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and
    (4)   Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.]
  b.  The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.
  c.  Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial services:<br />Line Item 0001 -Services, non-personal, to provide all labor, equipment and materials (unless otherwise provided herein) necessary to support Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) with an assessment of lost shipping container and science support team with a research vessel to operate a deepwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and video surveys, in accordance with the statement of work. Quantity - 1 job.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>Statement of Work:<br />Background<br />An estimated 10,000 intermodal containers are lost at sea yearly along international shipping routes. Carrying an assortment of cargo and covered with paint of varying toxicity, lost containers may take centuries to degrade on the deep seafloor, but actual assessments of this process are lacking. In February 2004, 24 containers were lost at sea during a storm off of central California. In June of 2004, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute discovered one container within the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (Sanctuary). The container is at 1,281 meters deep on Smooth Ridge, and was surveyed in 2011. The Sanctuary will now support a second survey of the lost container area, to determine succession of species on and around the container, to determine the toxic nature of paint in the sediment surrounding the container, and to set up an experiment to assess the difference in colonization of toxic versus "green" (environmentally friendly) container paint as well as natural rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Task 1: Video surveys and deep sea animal assemblage characterization<br />Access the container and surrounding benthos at 1,281 meters; conduct video surveys and take benthic cores; compare the fauna on the container versus around it at different distances; compare the fauna on the container since the last survey.</p>
<p>Deliverable 1: Cruise on a capable research vessel; submit manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal</p>
<p>Task 2: Assess toxicity of container paint that has chipped off of the container<br />Perform chemical analyses on the sediment around the container at different distances and assess their toxicity.</p>
<p>Deliverable 2: Toxicity report and submit manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal</p>
<p>Task 3: Assess the toxicity of different types of container paint<br />Develop and initiate a manipulative experiment to assess the toxicity and colonization on different types of container paint (standard and environmentally friendly) as well as natural rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Deliverable 3: Project page for the SIMoN web site (see- http://www.sanctuarysimon.org)<br />The government will provide the necessary computer equipment and information to perform this contract.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>Scientific and Research Misconduct</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this provision -</p>
<p>Scientific activities mean activities that involve inventorying, monitoring, observations, experimentation, study, research, integration, modeling, and scientific assessment.</p>
<p>Scientific integrity means the condition resulting from adherence to professional values and practices when conducting and applying the results of science that ensures objectivity, clarity, and reproducibility, and that provides insulation from bias, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, interference, censorship, and inadequate procedural and information security.</p>
<p>Presentation of scientific activities results includes the analysis, synthesis, compilation, or translation of scientific information and data into formats for the use of the Department of Commerce or the United States of America.</p>
<p>Scientific and Research Misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing scientific and research activities, or in the products or reporting of the results of these activities. It specifically includes intentional circumvention of the integrity of the scientific and research process and actions that compromise that process, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.</p>
<p>Investigation is formal collection and evaluation of information and facts to determine if scientific or research misconduct can be established, to assess its extent and consequences, and to recommend appropriate action.</p>

<p>3. Primary Responsibility. The Contractor shall have the primary responsibility to prevent, detect, and investigate allegations of scientific and research misconduct. Unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall promptly conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of such misconduct and may rely on its internal policies and procedures, as appropriate, to do so.</p>
<p>4. By executing this contract, the Contractor provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigating, and reporting allegations of scientific and research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigation and reporting of such misconduct.</p>
<p>5. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this provision in subcontracts at all tiers that involve research being performed under this contract.</p>
<p>(c) Investigating Misconduct Research</p>
<p>1. Initiating Investigation. If the Contractor determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it shall notify the Contracting Officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the<br />Contractor shall:</p>
<p>a. Promptly conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of scientific and research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted.</p>
<p>b. If the investigation leads to a finding of scientific and research misconduct, obtain adjudication by a neutral third party adjudicator. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.</p>
<p>2. Finalizing Investigation. When the investigation is complete, the Contractor shall forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the Contractor's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response (if any).</p>
<p>(d) Findings and Corrective Actions</p>
<p>1. If the Contractor finds that scientific and research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process and shall:</p>
<p>a. Take all necessary corrective actions, which includes, but are not limited to, correcting the research record, and, as appropriate, imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future, and</p>
<p>b. Coordinate remedial action with the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(e) Department of Commerce Actions</p>
<p>1. The Department of Commerce may accept the Contractor's findings or proceed with its own investigation, in which case the Contractor shall fully cooperate with the investigation. The<br />Contracting Officer will inform the Contractor of the Department's final determination.</p>
<p>2. The Department of Commerce reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the contract and applicable laws and regulations. Such remedies and actions may include, but are not limited to, disallowance of costs, recoupment of contract payments, and suspension or debarment.</p>

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:  Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

<DESC>In the RFP Amendment to Solicitation 2013-21016A of November 18th, USTDA received inquiries related to access by the U.S. Contractor to classified sites and information. This information is restated below:
<p>USTDA received inquiries as to how many sites are considered classified. All the sites selected for the study are considered classified.</p>
<p>USTDA received inquiries as to what is considered classified. Information pertaining to server/network/application inventory and their interfaces are all considered classified.</p>
<p>USTDA received inquiries as to whether the selected Contractor will be able to survey sites with high security or classified processing. The selected Contractor will not be able to do this.</p>
<p>USTDA then received follow-up inquiries related to the above. In order to clarify the situation with regard to access by the U.S. Contractor personnel (as opposed to the cleared Romanian subcontractor personnel) to classified systems and information, the Offerors are notified that:</p>
<p>&bull; In this project will be handled both classified information and unclassified information. As mentioned in Request for Proposal (section 3.6 Romanian Classified Information) and Annex V - Terms of Reference (Sub-Task 2.2 - Information Gathering) the data / documents / deliverables containing Romanian classified information shall be handled in accordance with Romanian Law regulating the protection of classified information under contractual activities (see Attachment I - Security Authorization Information). The U.S. Contractor will have the opportunity to perform the FS based on unclassified information.<br /><br />&bull; In order to avoid any kind of misunderstanding, we underline that, as is mentioned in Attachment I - Security Authorization Information: "In order to obtain the industrial security approval, the trader fills an application to the contracting authority". In this case submission place is: Directorate for Communication and Information Technology (Directia pentru Comunicatii si Tehnologia Informatiei), Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Government of Romania, Piata Revolutiei nr.1 A, sector 1, Bucharest, Romania.</p>
<p>In addition we received the following question, "What is the classification level for information handled in our project?"<br /><br />The response is as follows: The preliminary analysis revealed that the classification level of information that will be handled in this project, relative to Terms of Reference, is &lsaquo;secret service&rsaquo;. If during project implementation is found the need to change the classification class/level of information handled in this project, it shall be necessary to obtain the appropriate authorization or industrial security certificate.</p>
<p>USTDA is making this information available for the benefit of all prospective bidders. Due to the date at which this information has become available, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the response date for this RFP is extended to 12:00 PM local (Romania) time on December 9, 2013</span></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED: <br /><br /></strong>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) at Lackland AFB, TX, has been asked to provide engineering, restoration and construction services to achieve Site Closeout (SC) through remedial action at Scott AFB, Illinois. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 4 September 2013. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL for approximately 29 sites. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Reference the latest SOO dated 4 September 2013 and attachments posted to FEBBIZOPPS for the latest documents. <br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: <br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, Illinois. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed price (FFP) pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. This requirement is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside.<br /><br />NOTE: You are hereby notified that the project owner has certified this project as a valid requirement. Firms will NOT be reimbursed for bid and proposal costs incurred. Therefore, if your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.<br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the third quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's ROM for this PBR is anticipated to be between $30,000,000 and $37,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Daniel Cevallos, Jr. Email correspondence shall be sent to Mr. Cevallos with a copy to the contract specialists, Ms. Laura Stewart and Ms. Rebecca Robinson. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements</span>: Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Insurance (EI)</span>: The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonding Capacity</span>: The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year. Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach. (Reference Presolicitation FA8903-13-R-0040 RFI documents.)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</span>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED: <br /><br /></strong>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) at Lackland AFB, TX, has been asked to provide engineering, restoration and construction services to achieve Site Closeout (SC) through remedial action at Scott AFB, Illinois. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 4 September 2013. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL for approximately 29 sites. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Reference the latest SOO dated 4 September 2013 and attachments posted to FEBBIZOPPS for the latest documents. <br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: <br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, Illinois. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed price (FFP) pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. This requirement is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside.<br /><br />NOTE: You are hereby notified that the project owner has certified this project as a valid requirement. Firms will NOT be reimbursed for bid and proposal costs incurred. Therefore, if your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.<br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the third quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's ROM for this PBR is anticipated to be between $30,000,000 and $37,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Daniel Cevallos, Jr. Email correspondence shall be sent to Mr. Cevallos with a copy to the contract specialists, Ms. Laura Stewart and Ms. Rebecca Robinson. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements</span>: Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Insurance (EI)</span>: The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonding Capacity</span>: The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year. Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach. (Reference Presolicitation FA8903-13-R-0040 RFI documents.)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</span>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information.

<DESC><strong>BAO OCS DRAFT System Requirements Document (SRD) (22 Nov 13)</strong>
<p>The BAO Program Office is releasing the OCS DRAFT SRD to industry for review and comment, as well as Capabilities Request for Information (CRFI). Provided with this posting are the following documents "OCS DRAFT SRD" and "CRFI Response Matrix". <br /><br />Industry respondents are asked to provide a capabilities response, in relation to the OCS DRAFT SRD. Respondents should use the provided CRFI Response Matrix to illustrate how their solution aligns with the requirements by selecting one of the following: "Does Not Meet", "Meets Threshold", "Exceeds Threshold", "Meets Objective", or "Exceeds Objective". In the "Solution Capability" column, provide rationale and/or capability data to support how the solution aligns with the requirement. Example: If you mark: "Meets Threshold", provide rationale to support that claim. Additionally, there is a column for industry to provide comments or questions on the individual requirements.</p>
<p>It is the intention of the Government to respond to general questions asked and post them under this FBO Posting. If you feel your question is "Competition Sensitive" or "Proprietary", please mark it and those will not be posted to FBO.</p>
<p>In addition to the CRFI response, the BAO Program Office would also like industry to respond to the following question:</p>
<p>1- Based upon your Company's potential OCS solution, would the potential solution be defined as a "commercial item" or "modified commercial item"? Or is it solely developed for Government use? (Responses should align with the definition of "Commercial Item" in FAR 2.101)</p>
<p>Responses to the CRFI (Excel File), additional questions, and responses&nbsp;should be submitted by<strong><em> COB on 13 Dec 2013</em></strong> and may be submitted via e-mail or by mailing your response to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William R Keaney IV, Contracting Officer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AFLCMC/WISK (Bldg 46) 1895 5th St<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7233</p>
<p>Personnel hand-carrying responses should contact the Contracting Officer&nbsp;to arrange a mutually acceptable arrival time. E-mail communication is preferred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William R Keaney IV, Contracting Officer, (937) 656-8145 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="mailto:William.Keaney@us.af.mil">William.Keaney@us.af.mil</a></p>
<p><em>Reminder: This notice is part of government market research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the "art of the possible" and associated material procurement and approach risks from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies and implementation for the BAO kit. The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition. All information provided in the 1 November 2013 postings still applies.</em></p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers:
<p>Question: You stated that you are seeking SDVOBs, however in Section 8.0 Place of Performance, you state that the contractor must be University Medical Center Based. Will this requirement be alleviated? Typically University Medical Centers are not small businesses? Can you please advise?</p>
<p><br />Answer: Medical centers are centers of research, innovation and advancement based on their culture of learning. The field of crisis management and PTSD is constantly evolving and advancing. ATF wants its people to have access to cutting edge knowledge that reflects best practices as proven by research. Medical centers offer that. In addition, when an employee is in crisis, a medical center offers a place where all the resources for mental health are in one place (outpatient therapy, in patient therapy, group therapy, etc). Medical center based program have everything available as needed when we need it (which is always without advanced warning).</p>
<p>Question: Since you are seeking sources - Small Business to be exact, are you simply saying that you want to ensure that the Contractor - a small business - provides ACCESS to these centers?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes</p>

<CONTACT>Antoinette M Campbell, Email amcampbe@opm.gov - Terri J. Miller, Contract Specialist, Email Terri.miller@opm.gov
<DESC>Purpose and Objective:
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice to identify small businesses, especially those in the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 8(a) program, that are capable of providing printing, distribution, and processing services in support of the annual Federal Benefits Open Season and other related retirement notices for Federal employees, their dependents and annuitants to be in compliance with the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) of 1959 (5U.S.C. 8901) and the Federal Employee Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) governed by 5 U.S.C 8955(b) and 8985(b) and Code of Federal Regulations 5 CFR 894.</p>
<p>This notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotations. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract, nor do they affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation, which may or may not follow or restrict the U.S. Government's eventual acquisition approach. Additionally, the U.S. Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this notice. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Retirement Services (RS) administers the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and the health and life insurance programs for former Federal employees, annuitants, survivors and their beneficiaries.</p>
<p>RS is responsible for administering the annual open enrollment period for annuitants participating in the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program, which is the world's largest voluntary employer-sponsored health insurance program, providing health benefits for approximately nine million individuals, of which Federal annuitants and survivors make up almost two million. The FEHB program is authorized by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) of 1959 (5U.S.C. 8901).</p>
<p>There were an estimated 230 health plan options for annuitants to select from during the 2012 Open Season. Total income for the FEHB Program in FY2012 was over $46 billion, and assets as of September 30, 2012, totaled approximately $81 billion. OPM has contracted with health plans since the inception of the program. These contracts cover the period from January 1st of the calendar year through December 31st. Normally, the Summer before the contract year begins, the Federal Employees Insurance Operations and the Actuaries Group negotiate rates in addition to a wide choice of health benefits coverage for eligible employees and annuitants.</p>
<p>RS needs to acquire the services of a contractor to provide printing, distribution, and processing services in support of the annual FEHB and FEDVIP Open Season and other related retirement notices for Federal employees, their dependents and annuitants to be in compliance with the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) of 1959 (5U.S.C. 8901) and the Federal Employee Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) governed by 5 U.S.C 8955(b) and 8985(b) and Code of Federal Regulations 5 CFR 894.</p>
<p>Capability Statement / Information Sought:</p>
<p>Interested businesses are encouraged to respond to this notice. However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required. Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience and/or ability to satisfy the minimum requirements listed below.</p>
<p>Capability Statement Requirements:</p>
<p>OPM is requesting information from vendors who provide services that support administering an employer group's benefits open enrollment period. These services include printing, distribution, and processing services, administrative, technical and customer service support of the following functions:<br /><br />Open Season Processing Services<br />Administrative Support <br />Program Support <br />Printing and Distribution Services <br />Customer Service/Call Center/ WEB/IVR Support<br />Data Transmission and Enrollment Processing Services</p>
<p>OPEN SEASON PROCESSING</p>
<p>Scope. The contractor shall be fully responsible for the printing and distribution of FEHB and FEDVIP materials, data transmission and enrollment processing of annuitants, survivors and dependent requests, including customer service support. Continuity of services must be maintained at the utmost proficiency without interruption throughout the contract period.</p>
<p>FUNCTION: ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT</p>
<p>Scope. The contractor shall be required to provide administrative support to OPM as may be necessary to facilitate and/or support the open season and/or meet the needs of the annuitants/survivors and participating carriers. The contractor must be fully aware that the basic components of the open season process in terms of the number of plans, options and participants, be fluid, and able to change within the period of the contract requiring the Contractor to add or delete records in its data base, identify affected individuals, and complete special mailings, concurrent with completing the other specified tasks within the strict timeframes and with a high level of accuracy. OPM requires quality standards and timeframes throughout this contract be adhered to strictly.</p>
<p>FUNCTION: PROGRAM SUPPORT</p>
<p>Scope. The contractor shall provide key personnel (i.e. Project Manager and Programmer/Computer Analyst) necessary to maintain constant communication between OPM and the contractor. The contractor shall work with RS Staff to plan and coordinate all requirements necessary to support the annual Federal Benefits Open Season for CSRS and FERS retirement programs covering approximately 2 million annuitants/survivors participating in the FEHB and approximately 400,000 annuitants/survivors covered by FEDVIP health insurance benefit programs.</p>
<p>FUNCTION: PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES</p>
<p>Scope. The contractor shall provide management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies and equipment (except as otherwise noted) and shall plan, schedule, coordinate and control all aspects of printing and distributing open season materials to annuitants/survivors. The contractor prints, personalizes, and mails open season materials to annuitants/survivors so that each annuitant/survivor receives health plan information specific to the geographical area in which the annuitant resides. Distribution of materials must be accomplished absolutely within the timeframes specified, so that the annuitant's annuity payments will accurately and timely reflect any health benefits changes requested during the specified period.</p>
<p>FUNCTION: CUSTOMER SERVICE/CALL CENTER/ WEB/IVR SUPPORT</p>
<p>Scope. The contractor shall provide the necessary facilities and customer service personnel to support responding to requests by answering telephones, email inquiries, web chats and written correspondence. OPM is receptive to innovative technologies and methodologies, including processing information and change requests using the World Wide Web with the demonstrated capability of successfully performing the specialized functions and addressing security and privacy issues; and at a minimum a toll-free Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology, Web Chat, Email or other advanced technologies.</p>
<p>FUNCTION: DATA TRANSMISSION AND ENROLLMENT PROCESSING SERVICES</p>
<p>Scope. The contractor shall provide management information system reports (i.e. data collection and data reporting) and will monitor and analyze the quantity and type of processing activity performed by the contractor during the annuitant open season. The data collection requirement is of critical importance to the agency's management of future open seasons. For example, the number of annuitants who changed enrollment to a plan whose brochure they requested is useful information when compared to the number of brochure requests for each plan because analysis of the comparison could indicate future trends in annuitant preference for certain types of health plans. The data collection and data reporting required is of two types: 1) continuous, electronic daily reports during open season processing; and 2) an annual written report after open season processing is completed. The contractor is required to have the capability to provide a current Workload and Processing Report upon request from OPM on any given work day. The following are the all reports required during the contract period.</p>
<p>IVR Statistics Report: Submitted on a weekly basis and captured in the annual written, includes the total number of calls, call duration, total number of early hang-ups, total busy time, total call time, total enrollment changes made through IVR, and other beneficial statistical information.</p>
<p>Open Season Survey Results: Submitted on a weekly basis and captured in the annual written, reports the responses to survey questions relating to customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Reconciliation information: Submitted on a weekly basis, accompanies each transmission to ensure that the number of actions transmitted by the contractor and the number read by OPM are in agreement.</p>
<p>Workload and Processing Reports: Submitted on a weekly basis, the format to be determined after the contract is awarded.</p>
<p>Receipts of written enrollment change requests after the end of the open season (without late authorizations): Submitted at the end of the open season period, includes the number of requests, batched by date of receipt, for each type of request received.</p>
<p>Annuitant Migration Reports: Submitted at the end of the open season period and one at the end of the contract period.</p>
<p>Report of Unprocessed Items: Submitted on a weekly basis, reporting the number of unprocessed action items must be submitted to the COR. The report should estimate the number of pieces of mail on-hand. This estimate should be based on the number of trays of mail or another methodology that has been explained by the contractor and approved by the COR.</p>

DRAFT PERFORMACE WORK STATEMENT:
A.	GENERAL INFORMATION 

Title of Project:  CPAC PMO, PRO Pharmacy Agreement Management Support and Pharmacy Data Analytics
1)	Purpose 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Chief Business Office (CBO),Consolidated Patient Accounts Centers (CPAC),  Payer Relations Office (PRO) is seeking professional services to assist with its efforts to increase Pharmacy Benefit Management company (PBM) and other pharmacy third-party payer compliance with federal statutory and regulatory payment requirements and to assist with the continued development of VA pharmacy network agreements with PBMs and other third-party pharmacy payers (TPPs).   

2)	Background
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Consolidated Patient Accounts Centers (CPAC) has developed a plan to address opportunities for improving revenue cycle business functions, identify new strategies to increase revenue and assist the field facilities in maximizing their revenue stream. PRO has assumed management and development responsibility of outpatient pharmacy agreements with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and other types of third party payers and requires assistance in determining if agreements and rate proposals from PBMs and other third party payers for outpatient pharmacy services meet federal payment requirements.
38 USC 1729 authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to recover and collect reasonable charges from third parties (for example, PBMs and TPPs) for the cost of non-service-connected medical care furnished to insured Veterans. The money collected from PBMs and TPPs help offset the cost of delivering world-class health care services to our nation's Veterans, and is revenue anticipated in the President's budget.
Under regulations published at 38CFR Section 17.101, reasonable charges consist of: 
"	VA's billed charges (that is, the total charges VA submits for the service, less any Plan copayment for which the member is responsible), or 
"	Amount the payer demonstrates it reimburses other providers in the same geographic area for the same services. 
If a third party declines to reimburse VA its billed charges and elects to pay VA as it would pay other providers in the same geographic area, VA has the authority to require the third party submit evidence, including claims data and agreements between the third party and non-government providers, to substantiate that the amount the third party is paying VA is the same as what it is paying non-government providers in the same geographic area. (38 CFR 17.101(a)(4))
The billing methodology VA uses to arrive at its billed charges for pharmacy claims are:       
"	For claims with Dates of Service on and after March 18, 2011, VA billed charges per prescription equals the total amount of the acquisition cost to VA of the drugs, plus a standard administrative charge that is computed annually. The administrative charge is computed based on national VA costs for providing outpatient prescriptions (both overhead costs and dispensing costs). The 2013 administrative charge is $13.18.  
"	For claims with Dates of Service prior to March 18, 2011, VA billed charges per prescription are the standard amount of $51.00. 

Following are several statutory and regulatory references related to payment third-party payer requirements for VA:  

"	38 USC1729 (a)(1)  "Recovery by the United States of the cost of certain care and services" 

"	38 CFR Part 17 "Charges Billed to Third Parties for Prescription Drugs Furnished by VA to a Veteran for a Nonservice-Connected Disability" and Section 17.101 "Collection or recovery by VA for medical care or services provided or furnished to a veteran for a non-service-connected disability," effective date March 18, 2011 (Federal Register October 6, 2010) 

"	38CFR Part 17 "Reimbursement Offsets for Medical Care or Services" and Section 17.106 "VA Collection Rule; Third-Party Payers," effective date July 25, 2011. (Federal Register June 24, 2011)

3)	Performance Objectives  
The Contractor shall provide support as stated to accomplish the deliverables described in this Performance Work Statement (PWS), which will enable VA to increase Pharmacy Benefit Management company (PBM) and other pharmacy third-party payer (TPP) compliance with federal statutory and regulatory payment requirements and to assist with the continued development of VA pharmacy network agreements with PBMs and other third-party pharmacy payers. 
Within this effort, CPAC will use contractor services to increase PBM and other third-party payer compliance with federal third-party payment requirements and identify whether individual PBMs and other third-party payer reimbursements meet federal payment requirements.

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal la s, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

2.	ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS

a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

b.	All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
c.	Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts.

Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.

If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandate, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by V.A., specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth.  Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<CONTACT>Anthony Ciccariello, Phone 7578783299, Email anthony.ciccariello1@us.army.mil
<DESC>Cockpit Avionics Integration Program Request For Information
<p>Synopsis:<br />Request for Information (RFI): Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB) Cockpit Upgrade</p>
<p>1.0 - SUMMARY:<br />1.1 - The Government has a requirement for the sustainment, modernization and enhancement of the A/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB) avionics cockpit.</p>
<p>1.2 - To fulfill this requirement, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), is investigating alternative acquisition approaches, identifying the feasibility and practicality of each in order to select the most favorable course of action. One alternative under consideration is a hardware and software, "total avionics cockpit", solution. To that end, the Government is seeking interested industry organizations that can furnish the personnel, facilities, equipment and materiel necessary to develop an integrated avionics system cockpit for the A/MH-6 platform with the potential for follow-on avionics systems life-cycle sustainment and support thru 2030. Additionally, as a follow-up to receipt of RFI responses, a Market Research Interchange Meeting (MRIM) may be held for this requirement, tentatively scheduled that is to be TBD.</p>
<p>1.3 - THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued, however it is highly recommended that you respond to the RFI if your company has the capabilities the Government is seeking. If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps). It is the responsibility of the potential sources to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 - BACKGROUND:<br />2.1 - Since the baseline A/MH-6M began fielding in November 2003, the MELB Program Management Office (PMO) has conducted a series of modification (preplanned and unplanned) programs to keep the aircraft updated with customer requirements and modernized mission equipment. The preplanned Block 3.0 configuration is the continuation of a block upgrade strategy designed to extend the service life of the A/MH-6M while long-term alternatives for aircraft replacement are analyzed. Part of the Block 3.0 program includes a digital cockpit upgrade for a digital moving map (DigMap), battle field networking, and interfaces for rapid insertion planned technology upgrades.<br />2.2 - Weight discipline is a critical element of this program. The end state of the Block 3.0 modification is successful implementation of the identified level of engineering, performance, and cognizance without increasing the basic empty weight of the aircraft.</p>
<p>3.0 - DESCRIPTION OF NEED: Objectives for the MELB Block 3.0 Cockpit Avionics Integration Program and vendor capabilities/qualifications include:</p>
<p>3.1 - Cockpit Avionics Functionality: The following provides a high-level list of the required MELB Block 3.0 system avionics capabilities:<br />3.1.1 - Avionics System Management/Data Load/Maintenance <br />3.1.2 - Aircraft Systems State Display<br />3.1.3 - Navigation <br />3.1.4 - Flight Management <br />3.1.5 - Communications Management <br />3.1.5.1 - Two-channel data-capable radio in conjunction with existing communications equipment (see Section 3.3 - Hardware below).<br />3.1.6 - Weapons Management <br />3.1.7 - Mission Sensor Management <br />3.1.8 - Tactical Situation Management</p>
<p>3.2 - Avionics Systems Integration:<br />3.2.1 - Interested parties should consider solutions that provide existing and desired capabilities including the functionality stated above and that follow the guidance below regarding hardware components with Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) considerations.<br />3.2.2 - Interface. Any proposed integrated avionics cockpit will be required to interface with a multitude of onboard systems and have the ability to easily integrate new aircraft systems. Integration of cockpit avionics into the aircraft will be performed by a third party vendor. Coordination with this third party will be necessary for full platform integration considerations such as installation, weight, power, cooling, data, and data interface requirements.<br />3.2.3 - A current and notional console layout is available upon request (Reference paragraph 3.7).<br />3.3 - Hardware:<br />3.3.1 - Overall considerations for hardware includes:<br />3.3.1.1 - Cube. Space is extremely limited in the A/MH-6 series of aircraft for cockpit displays, cabin Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), and wire runs. In general, available space for avionics includes areas behind and beneath the consoles, area directly forward of the center console, under the pilot/copilot floorboards, and avionics racks behind the pilot seats (Diagrams with approximate dimensions are available upon request (Reference paragraph 3.7).)<br />3.3.1.2 - Weight. As previously mentioned, weight is a critical element of this program. The weight of the cockpit trade space is estimated to be 120 pounds. (additional information regarding candidate core avionics components for removal/replacement is available upon request (Reference paragraph 3.7).) This weight value is only an estimate to be used for preliminary planning. <br />3.3.1.3 - Power. The A/MH-6 cockpit must operate on 28VDC power. The aircraft does not contain an AC generator. Additionally, aircraft start must be performed on battery power. As a result, critical aircraft state information must be displayed during the start sequence.<br />3.3.1.4 - Environment. The A/MH-6 cockpit will be exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as sand, dirt, debris, and moisture due to frequent open cockpit operations.<br />3.3.1.5 - Night Operation. The A/MH-6 cockpit must be compatible with Night Vision Goggle (NVG) operations.<br />3.3.1.6 - The avionics system equipment will be of the manufacturer's current design (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Level 7 or higher desired), military and/or civil qualified, and capable of performing its intended function in accordance with the operation and performance requirements specified herein. <br />3.3.2 - Upon request, a list of some of the avionics LRUs planned to be retained as a part of the aircraft configuration may be provided (reference paragraph 3.7). These LRUs, including Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF), radios, Tactical Airborne Navigation (TACAN), Air Data Computer (ADC), and Radar Altimeter, must integrate with any proposed cockpit design.<br />3.3.3 - Mission-specific equipment and functionality, such as Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), may also be integrated into this platform as a part of the cockpit avionics integration effort. The Government's primary intent for this RFI is the investigation of candidate cockpit solutions with a focus on reduction in weight attributed to core equipment.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is an unusual and compelling urgency and a delay in award would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government (FAR 6.302-2). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> The 139th Airlift Wing of the Missouri Air National Guard has an emergency requirement for the repair of an underground water line break.  Included in the requirement are tearing out asphalt & concrete streets and parking lots to discover the exact site of the break, plus associated repairs and repaving of the affected areas.   Approval is requested for a sole source acquisition. Delay of award would result in serious injury to the Government, for both property and financial considerations, IAW FAR 6.302-2(b)(2).
