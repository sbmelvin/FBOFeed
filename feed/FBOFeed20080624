<CONTACT>Robert Hylton robert.hylton@hanscom.af.mil

<a href="mailto:robert.hylton@hanscom.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>The computer solution for the Tactical Air Control Party Modernization (TACP-M) Program is a rugged, small, light weight, and low power portable computers that use PC Internal Data Modems (PCIDM) to interface with Ultra High Frequency (UHF), Very High Frequency (VHF), High Frequency (HF) and SATCOM radios . Currently, the interface between the computers and the Internal Data Modem is the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) slots. Many computers in this class lack PCMCIA support. In addition, the PCMCIA slots will become obsolete in the future as the computer industry is moving to other interface methods. The contractor will modify the existing PCIDM product to work with computers lacking PCMCIA support and future migration through the use of Universal Serial Bus.
This RFI revision clarifies the NAIC code and provide more clarity to the requirements.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for Low-speed Control - Thruster Demonstration FlightExperiment Using the AEROS 40-D AirshipConventional control surfaces, such as fins and canards, have quite limited controlcapability when air vehicles fly at low speeds (e.g., take-off and landing) or hover.Utilizing the moment generated by thrust is an efficient way to solve this problem. Asfor the thrust source, compressed cold gas, micro turboprop, and ducted fan are possiblesolutions. Aeros has done the preliminary design of the thruster nozzle, and implementedbasic ground test using compressed air as the thrust source. During this project, Aeros40D airship will be used as the flight demonstrator to demonstrate the feasibility andefficiency of the proposed method to low-speed and hover flight. The major tasks arelisted as follows.Complete the hardware design, including thruster assembly, air feeding system, andcompressed air reservoir.Develop the pilot-in-loop control system, including control interface, inertialnavigation system (INS), GPS, and controller.Develop flight data acquisition system to record real-time flight data, environmentcondition, and control commands. Identify necessary design modifications on Aeros 40D airship as the flight demonstrator.Integrate the experimental low-speed control system with Aeros 40D airship.Perform flight experiment to collect real-time data for further analysis.Analyze data to study the vehicle behavior with different thrust sources, and establishthe design requirements for automatic low-speed control.  Deliverables:-White paper with technical justification for thruster selection for test-40-D low-speed experiment plan (include test matrix)  part 1-40-D low-speed control thruster experiment report  part 2NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Worldwide Aeros Corporation by authority of10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services WillSatisfy Agency Requirements.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon July 1, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool to determine potential sources and interested parties for an intended procurement.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized and posted at http://ideasec.nbc.gov. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. The estimated value of the intended procurement is $500,000-$1,000,000.

The government is considering setting this acquisition aside for HUBZone or 8(a) businesses.  Response to this synopsis will be a major factor in determining if this acquisition will be set aside.  ALL interested parties are requested to respond.   If adequate interest or sufficient supporting documentation is not received from HUBZone or 8(a) concerns, the solicitation may be issued as a small business set-aside or unrestricted basis without further notice or may be canceled.
All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this synopsis not later than July 2, 2008 at 1:00 PM PST.   Please submit all requested documentation listed below to Teena Glasper via email: tglasper@mp.usbr.gov.

In addition, Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102 and 4.1201, apply to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.   Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 335321 and the related small business size standard is 1,000 or few number of employees.

The UGS utilizes four types of sensor cards: Directional/Seismic (DS), Dual Directional (DD), Dual Seismic (SS) and Contact Closure/Open (CC).  See attached description of specific make and model.

Firms must be authorized resellers of Monitron equipment.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) plans to procure on a sole source basis for services regarding the NIH-RAID project "Developing SRX246 for Stress-related Affective Illness" with Frontage Laboratories, Inc., 105 Great Valley Parkway, Malvern, PA 19355.<br /> <br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-(b)(1) and 13.501-(a)(1) to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.5M.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:  Performance shall be two months from date of award.</p>
<p>The NCI's DTP supports pharmaceutical development of novel therapeutic agents identified in its own drug development program as well as through several initiatives arising from investigator initiated research programs in the academic and not for profit sector.  Drug development for lead compounds identified by investigators at academic and not for profit institutions are designated as RAID programs (Rapid Access to Interventional Development).  DTP is seeking an organization to prepare three strengths of SRX246 capsules, one batch per strength and one batch of placebo so that SRX246 can be evaluated clinically.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements</p>
<p>1)	Qualify NCI provided analytical HPLC methods used to assay SRX246 drug substance alone and in capsules. <br />2)	Adapt the HPLC method to monitor the dissolution of SRX246 in capsule dosage forms.<br />3)	Manufacture three strengths of SRX 246 capsules: 20, 50 and 100 mg, one lot/strength, and one batch of placebo capsules under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).  Each batch of SRX246 active is of sufficient size to deliver 5000 capsules.  Two thousand capsules of placebo are required.  The capsule will need to be opaque and identical in size and appearance across the range of strengths of active and for the placebo.  Since the capsules will be identical in appearance manufacture of a particular strength must be completed before initiating preparation of the next strength.  The contractor is responsible for providing capsule shells, excipients if needed, packaging materials, and labels. Certificates of testing are required for all product contact materials, e.g. capsule shell, desiccant, cotton or equivalent plug, containers and closures. Where compendial specifications are available, the materials must conform to those requirements. <br />4)	Batch records are prepared by the contractor and approved by NCI prior to manufacture. <br />5)	Contractor is responsible for packaging of clinical trial material, i.e. units of 50 capsules/HDPE container with desiccant and cotton plug. NCI provides the text information for label and approves final label.  <br />6)	Test the three batches of SRX246 capsules and one batch of placebo capsules according to specifications provided by NCI.</p>
<p><br />SRX246 contains a beta lactam moiety, in common with penicillins or cephalosporins.  However, SRX246 is highly stable to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis of the four membered azetidinone ring and does not behave biologically as a penicillin or cephalosporin with respect to allergic potential.  Thus, manufacturing in a facility that already handles penicillin or cephalosporin products is not an option.  See Guillon et al. Bioorg Med Chem 15:2054-2080 2007 Azetidinones as Vasopressin V1a antagonists (compound 50, p 2062, 2064) for the chemical structure of SRX246.  Market research done by the program shows that there is only one known vendor who is capable of meeting all the scientific specifications required by NCI, Frontage Laboratories.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on July 3, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80103-MM on all correspondence.</p>

<SUBJECT>Systematic Literature Review and Evidence Based Report on Food Allergy
<SOLNBR>RFP-NIAID-DAIT-NIHAI2008035
<CONTACT>Donald E Collie, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-0992, Fax 301-480-4675, Email dcollie@niaid.nih.gov
<DESC>On July 19, 2007, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT), American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) and the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) co-organized a one-day workshop entitled Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food Allergy. More than 20 professional societies and organizations sent representatives to this meeting. The purpose of the workshop was to discuss the potential value of clinical guidelines to be generated with input from a broad range of health care providers who diagnose and treat patients with food allergies and diseases related to food allergy such as atopic dermatitis, asthma and eosinophilic esophagitis. The workshop participants concluded that a significant need exists for guidelines that could be used in a variety of clinical and health care settings.
The NIAID plans to use a report based on a systematic literature review, in conjunction with consensus expert opinion, to develop clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of food allergy. Drafting of the guidelines will be performed by an independent Food Allergy Guidelines Expert Panel.

Step 1: Review of the scientific and clinical literature by an independent Contractor.  The Contractor will perform a systematic review, and will evaluate and grade the data.  This Contractor will also produce a draft and a final evidence-based report summarizing the state-of-the-science, including knowledge gaps and areas in which consensus has not been reached.

Step 2: The NIAID will establish an Expert Panel that includes representatives from professional organizations, patient advocacy groups, NIH Institutes, and other government agencies that have a substantial interest in the care of individuals with food allergy.  The Panel will develop draft Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food Allergy.  The Panelists will use both the evidence-based report and consensus expert opinion as the basis for developing draft guidelines.  Draft guidelines will be made available for public review and comment prior to completing the final guidelines. It is anticipated that the Contractors who produce the evidence-based report (Step 1) will designate representatives to serve as consultants to the Expert Panel in an ad hoc capacity.

Step 3: The Expert Panel will develop the final set of guidelines based on its review of the draft guidelines, public comment, and endorsement by the participating organizations.  The final guidelines will be disseminated to healthcare practitioners and the public by the NIAID and the participating organizations.

The ultimate goal of this solicitation is to produce a report of the state of food allergy science in a manner that can used to develop clinical guidelines that will be directly applied to healthcare decisions made by clinicians, patients, policy-makers and payers.  The report is expected to cover all relevant clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic areas, including prevention.

Title of Project:  Lower Parking Lot Rehabilitation
A site visit meeting is tentatively planned for July 29, 2008, at 9:00am.  All interest parties are encouraged to attend.  Participants are requested to meet at Jackson Visitor Center, Mount Rainier National Park, Washington.  
Description:  The work of this contract consists of the demolition and removal of the Henry M. Jackson Memorial Visitors Center, and the rehabilitation of a portion of the Lower Paradise Area, after the existing Jackson Visitor Center is removed. Work includes crushing of concrete, masonry, and stone on site and hazardous materials abatement, including the removal of two (2) 10,000-gallon fuel tanks and associated fuel lines.
Hazardous materials abatement and salvage will be done in September, October, and November of 2008. The Visitor Center will be demolished in April and May of 2009. The partial parking lot and site rehabilitation will consist of rough grading to be done in May and June of 2009. 
The concrete Visitor Center was built in 1966 and remodeled in 1988. It consists of a partial basement and three main floors and a mezzanine with a total of 60,000 square feet. The basement has a boiler room, fan room, maintenance shop, public restrooms, a lounge area with showers, three staff apartments, storage, refrigerators and freezers. The boiler room has two diesel-fired boilers (installed in the mid 1980's) that supply low-pressure steam to the unit heaters throughout the building and also heat the glycol based roof snow melt system.The main floor of the building contains a cafeteria, information desk, restrooms, bookstore and gift shop. The second floor has an exhibit room, and auditorium with projection room and the mezzanine contains an additional exhibit room and storage.
The third floor is the observation room with a 360-degree view. There is a central pipe chase extending from the basement up through the middle of the building to the penthouse fan room. This chase contains the main exhaust vent for the boilers; heating supply lines for the snow melt system, and supply lines for the perimeter radiators on each floor. 
The building was modified in 1988 and a new copper roof was installed in 1998. Some of these projects as well as other updates have involved abatement of asbestos-containing materials. A hazardous materials survey was conducted in 2004 that identified asbestos containing materials, lead-based paint, fluorescent light tubes that may contain mercury and ballasts that may contain PCBs, and mercury containing light switches. There are also electrical transformers that may contain PCBs.
The two 10,000-gallon, underground, diesel fuel tanks will be removed. It should be assumed that there will be contaminated soils in the fill port areas. All hazardous material and contaminated soil remediation must be accomplished in compliance with Pierce County, State, and Federal regulations.
Items to be sold for reuse or recycled by the contractor include: two boilers, elevator equipment, copper, steel, aluminum, generator, cooler-freezer equipment, and dining room furnishing. All concrete and stone from the building will be crushed and used as fill on site. 
It is anticipated that the crushed concrete from the visitor center demolition will be sufficient to provide for rough grading for paved and landscaped areas.   There is a requirement to stockpile 1,600 cubic yards of crushed concrete and stone to be used in a future contract for final road base.  Because the exact quantity of crushed concrete and stone that the building demolition will yield and the exact quantity of crushed concrete and stone that is needed are not known, this contract provides for the transport of surplus crushed concrete and stone and the import of borrow depending on the exact needs.  Utilize all crushed materials on site and provide the 1,600 cubic yard stockpile, before importing borrow.
The existing utilities connecting to the building (water, sewer, power and data) will be disconnected by the Park, as scheduled by the Contractor in agreement with the Park.  Abandoned utility lines, encountered during demolition of the building, are to be removed by the contractor.  Utility lines located outside the boundary of the building and that are not interfering with the removal of the building are to be left in place. Contractor is to coordinate with the Park for utility work that is to be performed by the Park.
Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.
Estimated price range: $700,000 to $1,500,000.
Time for completion, 11 months; work to be completed by July 1, 2009. 
Proposal receipt date is approximate; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available.
All responsible Hubzone sources may submit an offer that will be considered. 
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories. 
Small Disadvantaged Business and  HUBZone firms must be certified in accordance with solicitation clauses 52.219-8 -- Utilization of Small Business Concerns  and  52.219-9 -- Small Business Subcontracting Plan (status of firms can be found on CCR's Dynamic Small Business Search).

As such, Option Year IV of the existing contract will be restructured to increase the domestic requirement for gun systems and procure gun systems for the RAAF.   The total number of gun systems estimated to be procured under this contract is now 205 units.

This action will be negotiated on a sole source basis with General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products (GDATP), 128 Lakeside Avenue, Burlington, VT 05401-4985, based on the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N61339-05-R-0095 was publicized on the Federal Business Opportunities on 01 September 2005 by the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Simulation and Training Technology Center  (RDECOM STTC) . This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, Joint Fires Product Line. Technical Points of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Mr. Roy Wall, RDECOM STTC, (407)384-3568, roy.wall@us.army.mil or Mr. Glen Loupe, PM STS, (407)384-5344, glen.loupe@us.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual Points of Contact: RDECOM Acquisition Center, Ms. Nikia Jelks, Contract Specialist, (407)384-5585, nikia.s.jelks@us.army.mil or Ms. Vanessa T. Dobson, Procuring Contracting Officer, (407)384-5581, vanessa.dobson@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>OBJECTIVE: RDECOM-STTC and PEO STRI is interested in researching, developing, and demonstrating how current Fires Simulations, such as: Call-For-Fire-Trainer (CFFT) and Joint Fires and Effects Trainer System (JFETS) can be integrated into the Joint Fires Product Line (JFPL) architecture.  The JFPL architecture is a requirements down, component up approach to a family of systems architecture.  The JFPL architecture is expandable and modifiable to support current and future training requirements.  A functional proof of concept of JFPL is desired and must have the following capabilities as a minimum:<BR><BR>1.	Support for Indirect Fire (IF) missions<BR><BR>2.	Support for Close Air Support (CAS) missions<BR><BR>3.	Support for Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS) missions<BR><BR>4.	Instructor Control over the simulation<BR><BR>5.	Trainee perspective and interaction with the simulated environment<BR><BR>The planned method for accomplishing the research in this prospective area is to utilize a single phased approach.   Therefore, White Papers submitted should be structured so that the technical approach/solution for the proposed research areas be addressed.  The White Paper must include the anticipated period of performance, a technical description of the proposed concepts, the technical objectives and a planned approach to accomplish the stated objectives as well as a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost.  The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any.  <BR><BR>This will be a 12-month effort and funding may consist of approximately $550,000.    <BR><BR>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION FOR THIS EFFORT.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  <BR><BR>WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION: <BR><BR>Any responsible offeror capable of satisfying the needs identified in this announcement may submit a white paper. White Paper submissions are encouraged as early as possible, but must be received at RDECOM STTC no later than 1500 hrs EDT 24 July 2008. No extensions will be granted. White papers must address requirements and shall not exceed 10 pages in length of computerized text at 12-pitch excluding resumes. Only unclassified white papers will be accepted.  The white papers will be reviewed to determine that the proposed effort is within the scope and interest of this solicitation.  A proposal will only be solicited from white papers deemed to best meet the program objectives. White papers will be evaluated by a technical review board using the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: (1) Scientific and Technical Merit: Proposed efforts should create new, or apply existing technology in a new way, that is advantageous to the proposed research topic.  The overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal must be clearly identifiable.  The technical concept should be clearly defined and developed.  Emphasis should be placed on the offeror's technical approach through a comprehensive, logical, orderly, concise, phased plan that indicates major milestones, critical paths, key events, capabilities that can be spun off, demonstration articles, etc.  Consideration should be given to the extent which current State-of-the-Art technology is expanded.    Offeror should discuss how their concept will be documented, demonstrated, or evaluated, and this discussion should be indicative of the understanding of what is required in this program.  (2) Potential Contribution to Military Services Needs and Transition to other Programs: The offeror must adequately address how the proposed program will meet the goal of the research topic.  The proposal must show understanding of the potential approach and make a compelling case for the viability of the proposed effort.  The relevance is further indicated by the offeror's understanding of the operating environment of the product or demonstration (current Military or Industrial technical problems/issues, limitations, etc.).  The relationships of the proposed effort with other ongoing or anticipated initiatives (military or civilian) that are focused on improving the Joint Fires Product Line should be considered.  Offeror should recognize and identify potential strategies for transitioning technology within the DoD.  Plans on how offeror intends to get developed technology, and information on these developments, to the user community should be considered. (3) Personnel: The qualifications, experience, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principal investigators and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations should be examined and assessed for the proposal objectives.<BR> (4) Corporate Capabilities and Facilities: Offerors are required to describe their relevant capabilities and accomplishments.  The offeror must have a demonstrated capability to conceptualize, develop theories, identify concept deficiencies, analyze, and develop mature concepts for rapid application/ demonstration.  Consider the offerors history of related work.  Also consider any unique facilities or equipment that the offeror possesses.<BR>  (5) Cost: The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be considered as well as the substantiation of the costs for the technical complexity described.  Evaluation should consider the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate and provide accounting of funds, equipment, and personnel, select subprojects, monitor and evaluate the program to achieve the proposed objectives, and respond to contingencies created by unanticipated technical barriers or breakthroughs.<BR><BR>Cost reasonableness and realism will be assessed, but this assessment is of a lower priority than the technical evaluation.   White Papers found to be consistent with the requirements of this announcement and deemed to best meet the program objectives may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  To be eligible for award a white paper must be submitted. Offerors will be notified whether or not their white paper was favorably received on or about 31 July 2008. Favorable review of a white paper does not constitute selection of the proposed effort for contract award and will not establish a binding commitment for the Government to fund the effort in whole or part. Upon notification, the Government will issue a request for proposal letter to the qualified offeror(s), who best meet the program objectives. If proposals are solicited, proposals are due 45 days (or sooner) from the time date of the request for proposal.  The requirements for proposal preparation and submission can be found at http://www.rdecom.army.mil/STTC/baa.html<BR><BR>This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the government to reimburse any proposal preparation cost for responding. The cost of proposal preparation in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 31.205-18. Any request for white paper or submission of a full proposal does not guarantee award. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time and shall not be liable for any cost of proposal preparation or submission. Within the meaning of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.102 and 35.016, this announcement constitutes the Government's solicitation for this effort. There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement. Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.

<DESC>The Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) East, MCAS Cherry Point, NC has a requirement the fabrication and assembly of five (5) Helicopter Night Vision System (HNVS) Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) aircraft installation kits (A-Kit) for the CH-53E helicopter.  It is the intent of the government to procure these supplies from DRS Technical Services, Inc, 37500 North Industrial Parkway Willoughby OH, on a sole source basis using a Firm Fixed Price contract. DRS Technical Services, Inc is the only known company capable of performing the manufacturing process for the HNVS (FLIR) A-Kits.  Although much of the kit consists of stock listed parts, the drawings required to fabricate and assemble the aircraft wiring and manufacture the aircraft mounting structure are solely the property of DRS TSI MILPARTS.  MILPARTS has maintained all the documentation required to fabricate, assemble and deliver the required A-Kits.  Furthermore, the Government no longer has access to an extra A-Kit, thereby eliminating the possibility of providing an A-Kit to another vendor so that they could reverse engineer it in order to meet the Governments requirement.  Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Phone: +55(61)3411-3733

INTELLIGENT CARGO AND INTELLIGENT NETWORK PORT LOGISTICS CHAIN PROJECT.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop technical assistance to define and evaluate the processes and cargo monitoring technologies that will allow Brazil to move toward an intelligent cargo and intelligent network port logistics chain for Brazils Special Secretariat of Ports (Secretaria Especial de Portos, SEP). 

The technical assistance would define and evaluate the processes and cargo monitoring technologies that will allow Brazil to move toward an Intelligent Cargo and Intelligent Network Port Logistics Chain.

Brazilian ports, like others around the world, are at a crossroad.  On one end of the spectrum they need to promote infrastructure modernization and operational process rationalization to facilitate the free flow of the legitimate trade of parts and products demanded by the global supply chains, on the other end they have to impose ever stricter security regulations related to the facilities, cargo flows, ships and other transport means, to prevent illicit trade and possible terrorism acts.

Even though trade facilitation and security regulation are at opposite ends of the spectrum, these dual functions depend on information sharing and the breaking of institutional barriers to guarantee a successful implementation.  Deployment of new processes and state-of-the-art management technologies are key steps to improve the performance of the port logistics chain, in order to minimize interruptions to the flow of cargo through the chain.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $523,500 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Portuguese directly to the Grantee by 1:00pm (local time), July 23, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC><p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This notice is for information and planning purposes only. This is not a request for proposals and does not commit the government to award a contract; therefore, no solicitation is available at this time. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Coordinating Center for Environment Health and Injury Prevention (CCEHIP) began studying home and recreational injuries in the early 1970s and violence prevention in 1983. From these early activities grew a national program to reduce injury, disability, death, and costs associated with injuries outside the workplace. In June 1992, CDC established the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC). As the lead federal agency for injury prevention, NCIPC works closely with other federal agencies; national, state, and local organizations; state and local health departments; and research institutions in support of research about causes, risk factors, and preventive measures for injuries outside the workplace. Like diseases, injuries are preventable. CDC's Injury Center uses the same scientific methods to prevent injuries that have been used to prevent disease: carefully describing the problem through surveillance, studying factors that increase or decrease risk for injury, designing and evaluating intervention strategies that target these risk factors, and taking steps to ensure that proven strategies are implemented in communities nationwide. Currently, NCIPC has developed and launched a pilot training course for the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Public Health (PH) Curriculum: "Forging a More Powerful Relationship." This notice is for market research purposes to determine the availability of potential vendors that can provide six (6) one-day Emergency Medical Services and Public Health training sessions at sites within the continental United States. The primary focus of the training is in the area of injury prevention. The goal of the training is to strengthen collaborative partnerships between EMS and the Public Health community. The objectives of the proposed program are to enable senior and mid-level managers of EMS and the Public Health community at the regional, state and local levels to know the names, contact information, and responsibilities of key players in EMS and Public Health within their communities; to better understand the missions, roles and daily activities of EMS and Public Health, and their respective impact on the communities they serve. Describe ways in which EMS and Public Health services/agencies can support one another and work together to better accomplish both missions with special emphasis on injury prevention. Identify opportunities for enhanced collaboration and next steps for shared action. The core tasks and minimum contractor requirements shall include: 1)Fully schedule, make accomodations, administer and facilitate six (6) one day skill building training sessions for EMS and PH practitioners within the continental U.S. 2) Demonstrate knowledge and expertise in event planning and conference support. 3) Demonstrate knowledge and expertise in designing and implementing an evaluation protocol. 4) Demonstrate knowledge of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Public Health (PH) operational processes. 5) Demonstrate adequate qualified personnel to successfully perform the work activities by the required dates. 6) Demonstrate ability to record meeting minutes and synthesize proceedings to develop reports. 7) identify familiarity with CDC programmatic processes. 8) Provide public health experience in the field of injury control. All responsible sources are welcome to submit a written capability statement demonstrating their ability to perform the aforementioned technical requirements. CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMONSTRATE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED ABOVE. Capability statements shall also include: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, business size and status. The NAICS code for this requirement is 813920. Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statement via email to plw9@cdc.gov. The subject line of the email shall be "EMS abd PH Curriculum Training Capability Statement". Capability statements will not be accepted after June 16, 2008.</p>

<DESC><p>This is NOT a request for proposal (RFP). NO solicitation is being issued at this time, and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Any information provided by industry to the government as a result of this sources sought notice is voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlement to payment or direct or indirect costs or charges to the government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to the government. The information obtained from industry in response to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP.
<p>The USAF Academy has a requirement for a ground-based fast-tracking/steering telescope (FTT) and mount for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite imaging, as well as classical astronomy and astrophysics applications. The telescope and mount will be installed, tested and operated in this government provided facility, located in the Cadet Area of USAFA (Colorado Springs, CO). It is the government's intent to have one primary contractor, who will oversee the design and construction of the telescope and mount. The government is pursuing separate avenues to provide a facility to house the telescope, to include the enclosure, dome, pier and appropriate power and communications capabilities.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to construct the fast steering mount and Optical Tube Assembly (OTA) to include primary mirror support (cell), truss, secondary mirror and assembly, tertiary mirror and assembly, and two Nasmyth-style instrument platforms, together with the control software and electronics necessary to fully operate this system. In addition, the successful offeror will be required to fully interface the telescope control system with the government furnished facility, to include design parameters for the facility to insure operability of the OTA and mount. The contractor will also be expected to provide operation and maintenance training as well as detailed documentation. The primary contractor will work closely with other contractors as well as the government when installing the telescope, in order to ensure that all specifications are met.<br />At minimum, potential sources are requested to provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Evidence they have completed similar type of work, including design, construction, and integration of 2 meter class telescopes on schedule and within original budget.</p>
<p>2. Ability to subcontract as necessary to qualified sources, and to oversee such subcontracts. Alternatively, the ability to team with other contractors on the original proposal to accomplish same.</p>
<p>3. Evidence of relevant team expertise, such as qualified optical engineers, software engineers, and mechanical/structural engineers.</p>
<p>4. While the telescope and mount is not envisioned as an operational AF asset, the telescope will be primarily used for satellite imaging and other Space Situational Awareness (SSA) activities. Accordingly, we request evidence of substantial experience (3 years or more) working in these areas, and evidence of awareness of current DoD Space Situational Awareness (SSA) operational requirements.</p>
<p>5. Evidence the potential contractor has engaged in this type of business for over 5 (five) years, has the necessary equipment, personnel, and financial resources to fulfill the requirements of this contract.</p>
<p>6. Demonstration of capability to comply with the Buy American Act.</p>
<p>7. A description and percentage of work most likely to be subcontracted, and what percentage of the subcontracted work small businesses could/would perform. This information will be used to establish small business subcontracting goals.</p>
<p>8. In the event a government facility is not completed prior to anticipated delivery, the government would like to know an estimated cost of storage per month of the finished assembly.</p>
<p>Attached are the draft specifications associated with this telescope and mount requirement.</p>
<p>Notice: Non-government personnel will be involved in this acquisition as technical advisors. The advisors are working for the following company: Valdez International Corporation, 1490 Garden of the Gods Road, Suite B, Colorado Springs, CO 80907. Valdez is under contract with the Academy to provide Research &amp; Development support.</p>
<p>All respondents are requested to indicate business size status in relation to the applicable NAICS code 333314 (Size Standard 500 employees). Also identify and address if your firm is 8(a), women owned, HUBZone, or otherwise classified as a small disadvantaged business. All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines capabilities in providing all of the above mentioned requirements with respect to the provided specifications. The capabilities packages should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated. The response should not exceed 25 pages, single-spaced, 10 point typed. Please submit one hard copy on or before 30 May 2008 to Mr. Jan K. Christensen, 10 MSG/LGCW, 8110 Industrial Dr, US Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs CO 80840, and one electronic copy via email to the follwing address: jan.christensen@usafa.af.mil.

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement  SS-NCI-TSB-2008-1
Title: Collection and Taxonomy of Shallow Water Marine Organisms
This Source Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only
and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the
National Cancer Institute (NCI).
The purpose of this SS is to identify qualified small businesses concerns
[including 8(a), woman-owned, HUBZone, small disadvantaged, or servicedisabled
veteran-owned] that are interested in and capable of performing the
work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis
of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.
As a result of this SS, the NCI may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). THERE
IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a
requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of
a response to this SS or the NCIs use of such information as either part of our
evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent
requirement. If this project is advertised, it is anticipated that one (1) costreimbursement,
completion type contract will be awarded for a period of five (5)
years.
The National Cancer Institute is seeking qualified small business concerns
[including 8(a), woman-owned, HUBZone, small disadvantaged, or servicedisabled
veteran-owned] to provide support to NCIs Natural Products Branch
(NPB), Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), Division of Cancer
Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), NCI. The NCI is seeking a contractor to
collect a substantial number of marine invertebrate samples for extraction and
subsequent screening for antitumor activity. This project is to continue the
exploration of marine organisms from the Tropics and other areas where unusual
habitats may have well evolved more specialized organisms and to use these
organisms as a source of potential new agents (pharmacophores) which can be
developed for the selective treatment of cancers in humans.
The target is to collect, taxonomically identify to species level, and to ship up to
450-500 samples per year (on average) over the five year contract term, of
marine invertebrates (which may include up to 10% of algae/cyanophytes) with
wet weights of roughly 1 kilogram each, in a frozen condition from the collection
sites to NCI-Frederick. In all collections, the major objective of the program is
that the collected species be from as wide a diversity of phyla and classes as is
possible.
The major collection areas will be the tropical and subtropical areas of the
Worlds oceans from sea level to ~50 meters. Collections from both niche areas
and from depths exceeding SCUBA depths of ~50 meters may be considered
provided scientific rationales and access to suitable equipment are acceptably
defined and realistically feasible. Collections may be performed by
subcontractors/consultants to the prime contractor. Due to uncertainties,
collections need not be performed in every year of the contract, but the
contractor must have the capacity and requisite expertise to collect,
taxonomically identify to species level, and to ship up to 450-500 samples per
year (on average) over the five year contract term.
Tailored Capability Statements shall demonstrate a clear understanding of all
tasks specified in the draft SOW. Tailored Capability Statements for this
requirement shall address the following ten (10) areas:
(1) Personnel. Quality and extent of the Principal Investigator's (PI) recent
experience, scientific accomplishments, qualifications for organizing this project,
and demonstrated leadership abilities must be addressed. The PI must be
experienced in the organization of collection programs, and should have at least
5 years of direct experience in marine invertebrate collection. The quality and
extent of scientific accomplishments and recent experience of the marine
invertebrate/plant taxonomists either accompanying the collection expeditions
and/or being responsible for the final complete identification of the specimens
obtained must be addressed. Marine taxonomists must be trained in marine
invertebrate taxonomy or a closely related field, preferably Ph.D. level (6 or more
first author papers in taxonomic journals showing their expertise in a specific
phylum/phyla) who will accompany field collections (or receive voucher samples,
etc.) in order to identify the collected species. The proposed Personnel shall
demonstrate that your organization has the necessary expertise to perform the
requirements of this project. Capability Statements must demonstrate that the
personnel experience stated in the Capability Statement occurred in conjunction
with projects comparable in size and complexity. Capability statements must
address the proposed personnels knowledge of marine invertebrate fauna and
marine flora of the areas proposed for collection; process for sample collection,
preparation, packaging and shipment from Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceanic
areas; taxonomy; familiarity with governmental and local customs of people in the
projected collection areas; knowledge of the regulations and procedures
necessary for operating in the project areas, and for the legal export and
shipment of samples [including knowledge of the Convention on Biodiversity
[CBD] and Convention on International Transport of Endangered Species (CITES
Convention) and their potential impacts]; demonstrated ability to successfully
negotiate and collaborate with authorities and officials on behalf of the project in
the countries of collection; collective recent [within last three years] collection
experience; and availability of all key personnel.
(2) Selection of the collection areas with documented evidence of projected
collaborations with suitable governmental/local organizations in the regions
selected for collections, the timing and scope of the collections, integration with
later large-scale recollections, possible safety hazards, and the advanced
planning required.
(3) Detailed methodology of collecting, minimizing of duplicate species
collections, preparation of samples including storage, preservation of voucher
specimens, taxonomy, labeling and documentation including photography.
(4) Documented experience in shipping of samples and voucher specimens, and

<DESC>IntroductionThis notice is for information and planning purposes only. This is not a request for proposal and does not commit the government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. Based on capability statements received in response to this sources sought announcement this acquisition may be solicited as a 100% small business set-aside.  All small business organizations (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZONE, VOSB, and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice.  Small business organizations must have their size status certified by the small business administration.  All small businesses are encouraged to respond. The NAICS code is 519190 with a size standard of $6.5M.
On July 19, 2007, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT), American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) and the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) co-organized a one-day workshop entitled Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food Allergy. More than 20 professional societies and organizations sent representatives to this meeting. The purpose of the workshop was to discuss the potential value of clinical guidelines to be generated with input from a broad range of health care providers who diagnose and treat patients with food allergies and diseases related to food allergy such as atopic dermatitis, asthma and eosinophilic esophagitis. The workshop participants concluded that a significant need exists for guidelines that could be used in a variety of clinical and health care settings.The NIAID plans to use a report based on a systematic literature review, in conjunction with consensus expert opinion, to develop clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of food allergy. Drafting of the guidelines will be performed by an independent Food Allergy Guidelines Expert Panel.The Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation Research Contract Branch (AIT RCB), NIAID Office of Acquisitions is seeking capability statements from small business organizations with the technical expertise to review the scientific and clinical literature on food allergy.  The Contractor will perform a systematic literature review, evaluate, and grade the data.  The Contractor will also produce an interim and a final evidence-based literature review report summarizing the results of the systematic literature review of food allergy, including knowledge gaps and areas in which consensus has not been reached.  Capability statements shall address the following tasks, and examples of previous experience with similar work should be provided as part of the capability statement:  
NIAID/CONTRACTOR COMMUNICATION:  Provide periodic progress reports and immediate and continued open communication with the NIAID Project and Contract Officers following award of the contract.SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW AND EVIDENCE GRADING:  Design and perform a full systematic literature review of primary literature (and in some cases, quality review articles) describing the state of the science in food allergy.  The review and analysis shall address all topics/questions outlined by the NIAID in the Request for Quotes (RFQ).  Examples of these topics/questions include defining food allergy, and describing the prevalence, natural history, diagnosis, and management of food allergy, including the diagnosis and treatment of acute food allergic reactions.  DRAFT REPORT CONTAINING THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW:  Prepare a draft of the final report, to be completed 6-8 months after the award of the contract, which shall be used as reference material by the Food Allergy Guidelines Expert Panel. FINAL REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW:  The final report describing the results of the systematic literature review will require the Contractor to assemble all extracted evidence into a comprehensive report on the state of the science in food allergy.  The final report shall address the topics and questions outlined by the NIAID in the RFQ.  The Contractor shall incorporate any editorial comments or changes suggested by the NIAID into the final report.  CONSULTING FOR THE FOOD ALLERGY GUIDELINES EXPERT PANEL: Designate 1-2 representatives to attend approximately 3 meetings of the Food Allergy Guidelines Expert Panel to summarize the methods and findings of the systematic review and final report.
The Government anticipates making a single award.  It is anticipated that the duration of the contract will be a maximum three (3) years; however, the length of time for which funds is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.

<p>Sources Sought Synopsis</p>
<p>The National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division (ESRL/GMD) (hereinafter referred to as the Government) located in Boulder, Colorado is currently conducting market research to determine sources for ozonesondes to provide accurate, highly vertically resolved ozone profiles that are compatible with an existing radiosonde/ground station infrastructure. The Government anticipates award of a contract with a 1-year base period followed by two 1- year option periods. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 334519 (Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing) and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The ozonesondes must be able to be interfaced with radiosondes that are compatible with the ESRL/GMD ground telemetry receiving stations. The ozonesondes are to be purchased over a period between 1 and 3 years. An indefinite quantity of systems (between 200 and 500 units per performance period) is required. The Government anticipates award of a contract on or before August 30, 2008. <br />Background:</p>
<p>NOAA has been making ozone vertical profile measurements using balloon-borne ozonesondes since 1972. The current global network of 12 sites has employed the current digital ozonesonde coupled to a meteorological radiosonde since 1990. This long-term measurement project is expected to continue indefinitely into the future. The ozone profile measurements obtained in the NOAA network provide critical information on the state of the stratospheric ozone layer, air quality, and the impact of ozone on climate change.</p>
<p>Key elements of this project are intercomparability of data among the various measuring sites and long-term stability of the measurements for detecting trends. To achieve these elements, standardized measurement protocols have been implemented across the network. An important component of these standardized procedures is the use of a uniform ground telemetry receiving station and associated software for processing the telemetry data. The receiving station and software have been developed and deployed at considerable expense to NOAA and NOAA would incur an unreasonably high cost to replace these. The ozonesondes provided for this project must maintain compatibility with the existing receiving station and associated software.</p>
<p>Draft Statement of Work Requirements:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide systems that have all the following features and/or meet the following minimum description/performance requirements:</p>
<p>1. The ozonesonde sensor for detecting ozone shall be of the electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) type.</p>
<p>2. The ozonesonde pump shall be non-reactive with ozone and shall operate effectively in the altitude range of 0-35km. A thermistor for measuring pump temperature shall be mounted in the pump.</p>
<p>3. The ozonesonde shall be capable of measuring ozone with an accuracy and precision of 5% over the altitude range of 0-30km and for ozone mixing ratios of 0-15 parts per million by volume.</p>
<p>4. Each ozonesonde shall be housed in a container that maintains the environmental conditions in the temperature range of 10-30 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>5. Each ozonesonde and its container shall weigh 1.5 kilograms or less.</p>
<p>6. Each ozonesonde shall be capable of interfacing with a radiosonde that provides a signal compatible with the ESRL/GMD network of ozonesonde telemetry ground station hardware and software through a manufacturer or user supplied digital interface. The ozonesonde will provide:</p>
<p><br />a. Provide connections to the ECC sensor current output and the pump thermistor;</p>
<p><br />b. Include a power source (battery) for the pump operation and any associated electronics;</p>
<p><br />c. Provide 1.5 second binary data output;</p>
<p><br />d. Read the sensor current with a minimum of 12 bit accuracy;</p>
<p><br />e. Provide for the input of pressure, temperature, and humidity data from the compatible radiosonde as well as the ozonesonde sensor current and pump thermistor resistance, and produce a data stream that can be transmitted by the attached radiosonde;</p>
<p><br />f. Transmit the data stream so that it can be received with a 403 MHz FM receiver and be converted to an RS-232 compatible signal by a standard serial modem;</p>
<p><br />g. Be capable of supporting input from a global position system (GPS) module compatible with the data stream requirement; and</p>
<p><br />h. Be capable of supporting two additional sensor inputs through an expansion module.</p>
<p>7. The telemetry ground receiving station consists of the following:</p>
<p><br />a. ICOM Model 8500 Receiver with automatic frequency control capable of receiving a signal in the 400-405 MHz wide FM frequency range;</p>
<p><br />b. Serial modem that decodes the Bell 103 format; and</p>
<p><br />c. Yagi antenna with preamplifier designed to receive the 400-405 MHz, signal transmitted by the radiosonde.</p>
<p>8. The custom written software program (STRATO) that processes the telemetered data from the ground receiving station has the following characteristics:</p>
<p>a. DOS program capable of running on several Windows operating system versions (Windows 2000 and XP);</p>
<p><br />b. Decodes the radiosonde signal information;</p>
<p><br />c. Incorporates the algorithms for processing the radiosonde meteorological information as well as all the ozonesonde current signal, pump temperature, and diagnostic information on the performance of the ozonesonde pump and battery current;</p>
<p><br />d. Processes data from the global position system (GPS) module;</p>
<p><br />e. Processes data from additional sensors including a chilled mirror hygrometer; and</p>
<p><br />f. Can be updated to provide for changing observational requirements associated with new research initiatives.</p>
<p>RFI Instructions:</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation; it is only a Request for Information (RFI). The purpose of the RFI is to determine (1) whether there are sources capable of satisfying the Government's requirements and (2) to determine whether these services are provided to the commercial market. No proposals are being requested or accepted under this synopsis.</p>
<p>Interested sources must provide information regarding their capabilities to provide ozonesondes that meet the above requirements. At a minimum, responders shall submit the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Statement explaining how the responder's ozonesonde meets the requirements with particular attention to communications with the ground station protocols;</p>
<p>(2) Identify any potential limitations or adaptations needed to meet the requirements;</p>
<p>(3) Briefly describe responder's experience in ozonesonde manufacture and production; and</p>
<p>(4) Provide DUNS or CAGE number.</p>
<p>NOAA will consider all comments, supportive or critical, but may or may not use these individual comments. Qualification Statements will be treated separately from, and will have no bearing on, any subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting future formal Request for Proposals. NOAA will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments. NOAA, as noted above, is assessing the existence of sources and is requesting written comments from industry on the attached requirements. Written comments or e-mail messages shall be received no later than 2:00 P.M. Mountain Time, Friday, July 11, 2008.

Ventilation cleaning shall include exhaust, supply and re-circulation systems and may include minor sheetmetal repair and/or fabrication.  Associated components shall include ducting with flow area of 7.07 cfm (cubic feet per minute) or less, fans, cooling coils, heating coils, access openings, terminal devices and condensation drip pans.  A task will normally consist of a site survey onboard U.S. Naval Ships, Coast Guard or military type vessels, cleaning ventilation systems, and repair or replacement of access openings and insulated covers.  Dampers and any air-directional mechanical devices within ventilation systems must have their positions marked prior to cleaning and upon completion be returned to those settings.  SWRMC is contemplating award of a firm-fixed price, single award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract for the scope of work summarized above.  The applicable NAICS code is 238220; plumbing, heating and air conditioning.  This acquisition will be conducted using the Advisory Multi-Step Process as described in FAR 15.202.  Interested small business concerns should submit a capabilities statement (not to exceed five pages) that demonstrates their capability to perform the services describe herein.  The capabilities statement shall include company name, address, small business status (small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, or service-disabled veteran-owned), [more than one category may be selected as applicable] and point of contact (POC) information for the interested firm.  The capabilities statement should identify, by contract number, past or current contracts and/or subcontracts that were awarded to your firm, period of performance, contract type, contract amount, a description of the relevant corporate experience gained, and a point of contact for the customer/recipient of the work performed.

It must be upgradable to balance ARH, UH-72 and modified blades on existing series helicopters.    The Blade Balancer must measure the actual weight of the blade, must calculate the center of gravity and span-wise/cord moment of the blade and must display the results to the operator.  The blade balancer must provide adjustments and/or a procedure that uses the existing blade balance hardware that will balance to factory acceptance specifications for each blade.  The Blade Balancer must be capable of completing blade balance within one hour.  The Blade Balancer must include a balance acceptance criteria function that identifies blades that are acceptable for use and require no balance adjustments.  That criterion shall be the factory acceptance span moment 30% of the available dynamic balance authority.    The Blade Balancer must not interface with aircraft power.  It must be a stand alone piece of ground support equipment not used directly on any aircraft.  The blades must be removed from the aircraft and placed on the Blade Balancer.

<a href="mailto:ira.patterson@usmc.mil">ira.patterson@usmc.mil</a>
<DESC>The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) is researching the application of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technologies to measure meteorological conditions as a method of improving direct and indirect fires accuracy.  The concept that has been developed by MCWL is using a LIDAR system to measure wind direction and velocity as well as air temperature and pressure at several atmospheric levels starting at ground level. MCWL is seeking information concerning the state of development, suitability, reliability, affordability, and producibility of these systems and their potential application to MCWL artillery ballistic experimentation.
MCWL is developing a Concept Demonstrator LIDAR Artillery Meteorology System (LAMS) to experiment with the technologies available to provide a direct measurement of the meteorological effects for artillery projectiles in flight.  Current methods require launching balloons with instruments at specific time periods to make these atmospheric measurements or to use Air Force data from their sensor systems. These methods are time consuming and often do not address the specific ballistic meteorological conditions in the exact area the artillery systems will be firing. A LAMS system is being proposed to attempt to provide direct measurement of the meteorological data from the firing position to the target direction for as far along the projectiles flight path as can be measured. The completed Concept Demonstrator system would be used for experimentation in operational environments and should have the following capabilities:
- Measure the wind velocities and directions vertically at 500 meter intervals, starting at 200m above ground level - Measure air temperature at the same 500m intervals- Measure air pressure at the same 500m intervals- Present the collected information into the NATO Computer MET Message format for use by artillery ballistic computing systems.
The threshold characteristics of this LIDAR Artillery Meteorology System (LAMS) are as follows:
- The precision of wind speed measurement is 1 Knot/hr + 1 knot- The precision of the measurement of wind direction will be 18 mils (1 degree) + 10 mils (0.56 degrees)- The precision of air pressure measurement is 100 millibars + 10 millibars- The precision of air temperature measurement is 1 degree Kelvin + 0.5 degrees Kelvin- Measures wind velocity and direction and air temperature and pressure at intervals from the station that correspond to altitudes above the station of 200m, 500m, 1,000m, 1,500m, 2,000m, 2,500m, 3,000m, 3,500m, 4,000m, 4,500m, 5,000m. (Threshold). 
The objective capability is to continue these measurements in 500m steps to 10,000m and more).
The LAMS displays the MET data in the NATO Computer MET Message format. (Objective capability will be to transmit this data directly to fire control systems). 
The LIDAR used in the LAMS shall be eye safeThe LAMS should be capable of being placed and transported aboard a High Mobility Medium Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). (Objective characteristics are to make the unit small enough to be placed on an individual gun system).Power requirements are 3 KW or less.
Sources capable of satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest, and/or white papers providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information should include: 1) identification of your company or organization, 2) your company's or organization's assertion of existing, capability to meet proposed requirements, 3) business/contracts/marketing office point(s) of contact information, 4) notification of business size and/or special status and 5) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited. These expressions of interest shall include commercial marketing info or web links and all should be submitted via email to Ira D. Patterson, Contracting Officer referencing the following tracking #9035. These should be submitted on or before 23 July 2008. This sources sought synopsis should not be considered a commitment of any kind by the Government and individual correspondence should not be expected in advance of any resulting pre-solicitation notice for the proposed requirements."

<DESC>Synopsis:

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), on behalf of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), will be hosting an Industry Day prior to soliciting white papers for innovative, creative, and high-risk research to advance the state-of-the-art in technologies and methods for the Analysis Space for Exploitation (A-SpaceX) program. The proposed BAA will address Phase 1 of a three phase program expected to take place over 48 months.  A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is anticipated to be released on or about July 15th, which will provide more details into this program. Phase 1 will focus on conducting critical research and development of key technologies with contract awards in the range of $250K - $1000K.  Phase 1 has an expected performance period of up to 18 months, and will culminate with a technology showcase for the benefit of potential users and system integrators.  Phase 2 will begin at the conclusion of phase 1 and will focus on developing prototype integrated systems.  Phase three will focus on utility / usability demonstrations in an operational environment.  The BAA will initially request white papers generally describing a performers area of interests and proposed work. White papers will be reviewed and invitations to submit full proposals will then be requested for those papers that best address current A-SpaceX research interests. Separate white papers may be submitted for different thrust areas. Formal proposals will be reviewed by a selection committee and those bidders determined suitable for IARPA funding under the A-SpaceX program will be invited to provide oral presentations. Actual awards may be determined based on formal proposals, oral presentations and concurrence of IARPA management.  We anticipate initial contract awards will be made by January 2009.

Overview: 
A-SpaceX is seeking to create an analytic environment where the workspace becomes an enabler for the analytic process  fostering creativity and effective analytic reasoning.  A-SpaceX envisions two key emerging technologies being fused in the workstation of the future to exploit the information available to the intelligence analyst: Virtual worlds, and Workflow management.  

Analysts will work with an integrated workstation that not only allows access to the legacy tools of today, but any number of virtual worlds designed to support the analytic process. Virtual worlds are defined here as: 1) Complex digital environments (models) that are shared across many users; 2) They may incorporate data models from a variety of sources, made up of objective data as well as hypothetical and/or theoretical constructs; and 3) Both persist and evolve whether or not any individual user is actively engaged with that world. A-SpaceX will demonstrate that this technology affords transformational opportunities to change the way people work in general, and how analysts will work in particular. A-SpaceX seeks to adapt virtual world technology to create synthetic worlds specifically adapted to support doing work.  Synthetic worlds will be multi-dimensional, dynamic visualizations of that data.  Synthetic worlds will be specifically developed to: 1) Highlight the dynamic aspects of the data, and how it changes; 2) Show the dynamic aspects of cognition, and how it changes; and 3) Demonstrate how groups of analysts can collaborate in the exploration of data and the sharing of analytic strategies.  

A-SpaceX envisions multiple synthetic worlds, each of which is optimized to support different kinds of analytic decision-making. Multiple synthetic worlds will be optimized for different analytic problems. The incorporation of multiple, coherent virtual worlds will require that there be a consistent set of protocols and usability standards to ensure that analysts may readily jump from one world to the next as needed to support exploring complex inter-related data.  Analysts will use synthetic worlds that allow large amounts of multi-dimensional information to be explored as models.    

Implicit in the A-SpaceX vision is that changes in data will be detected by automated agents working on behalf of the analyst to both find relevant information, and highlight when data already integrated into analytic products has changed. Legacy applications will be integrated into the workspace through the incorporation of proximal displays located close to the analysts, while exploration in parallel synthetic worlds will be available through distal displays that will serve as windows into the synthetic world.  Proximal and distal displays will be part of a single integrated digital desktop so that no matter how physical displays are used, the moving of information from one display area to another is as seamless as possible. 

Synthetic worlds, unlike the virtual worlds from which they are derived, will connect the analyst not only to other analysts for collaboration across users, but also with themselves and their previous states of thought about a problem. Analysts will be able to explore their own past thinking about the data as well as enabling the proactive exploration of how that data might change in the future. 

Phase 1 of the A-SpaceX program will have three major thrusts:  1) Development of a Synthetic World foundation which includes an over-arching concept of operations for the employment of virtual worlds as part of the analytic infrastructure, along with the definition of prospective architectures for the use of synthetic worlds with legacy software and hardware infrastructure.  2) The research and development of key science and technologies for a Time Machine synthetic world; as well as theory & usage CONOPS specific to the incorporation & exploitation of changing data.  3) The research and development of science and technologies for MindSnaps that capture key aspects of an analysts decision-making process in conducting analyses; as well as the development of a Decision Space virtual world visualizing the analytic process.

Thrust 1  Synthetic Worlds Common Elements.  
Common to both the development of MindSnap and Time Machine capabilities will be the development of an overarching concept of operations (CONOP) and a shared HumanComputer Interface for the use of synthetic worlds as analytic tools.  Further, the application of current virtual world technologies to support the proposed CONOP will require the adaptation of current virtual world technologies.  The A-SpaceX program will therefore include a systems engineering task to address the common information technologies anticipated as being required for the use of synthetic worlds in support of the analytic tasks.  During Phase 1 of the A-SpaceX program, we anticipate that these tasks will be largely limited to the definition of coherent CONOP as well as architecting the requirements for supporting systems architectures.  There may be limited development of those services and the definition of knowledge representation in support of the critical services identified as being required for the A-SpaceX CONOP.  

Thrust 2 - Time Machine. 
Virtual worlds are in fact models that have several relevant properties: they can be shared by multiple people, they are persistent, and they evolve over time.  As a model, it is possible to systematically explore temporal aspects of change of data and events that occur in the physical world.  Forensic analysis can be performed by replicating the real world in a synthetic world. In this forensic mode, alternative explanations can be explored by adjusting assumptions and the quality index of the collected data and allowing the changes to propagate into the future. Proactive analysis could be explored by applying predictive models that look forward in time and suggest indicators leading to future events.

Virtual worlds allow the representation of complex, n-dimensional data sets, they can be shared by multiple people, and they evolve over time.  In developing synthetic worlds to facilitate analysis, one of the more interesting aspects of synthetic worlds will be their ability to explore how data changes, and the implications of that change in formulating hypotheses about, and explanations of, change.  We believe a key dimension of exploring changing data will be the ability to manipulate time in the synthetic worlds  in effect turning these worlds into Time Machines.  The use of synthetic worlds as Time Machines is conceptually about the explorations of data, and as such, may be (but need not be) tied to a physical location.  These synthetic worlds will allow a variety of data abstractions to be embedded, layered, and compared. A critical issue in creating a Time Machine capability will be the ability to detect and manage significant changes from data.  A-SpaceX will seek research and development for technologies that will address contextually relevant change detections and management from raw data streams. Further, the complexity of the data sets possible in synthetic worlds for analysis suggest that tools to optimize how those worlds work and appear for specific analytic problems will require the development of context lens & filters that will make it possible to highlight, distort or block different kinds of data within a synthetic world.  

The CONOP for Time Machines is expected to transform how analysts would explore data.  For instance, analysts can work from a here and now where they pick a perspective of interest from which to explore the data sets represented within a synthetic world.  The analysts would then assess possible futures relative to their chosen perspective in place and time; effectively assessing the possibilities for then and there and developing potential hypotheses for what is possible in the future given what is known from the here and now.  Another analytic CONOP might be that analysts could hypothesize a discrete (specific) future and then assess the viability of that hypothesis by exploring both known and unknown data represented in the synthetic world.  In effect, the Time Machine CONOP would allow analysts to engage in forensic and proactive analysis, by viewing past/future perspectives.

Thrust 3 - MindSnaps. 
Current information technology is completely agnostic regarding helping an analyst to perform work.  The burden is on the analyst to use tools to annotate, organize, and associate their work products.  The analysts workflow process is complicated by methodology practices and security requirements of the IC that add even more tedious and time consuming activities.  Today, there is no formal or proscribed mechanism for tracking analytic workflow.  Current automation limitations make it extremely difficult for analysts to remember, find, and return to their analytic decision points to reconsider information changes, or try alternative hypotheses.  None the less, analysts have to explain, share and propagate work products with supporting rationale to peers and managers.  

So today, when an analyst views the information space available to them and sees figuratively an opaque mass of information that has to be penetrated to find anything of importance, they are left to their own ingenuity to find work-arounds or other solutions to perform analysis.  There is little or no automated support to help them recall what may be related or associated with what is new or changed. 

A-SpaceX MindSnaps will address the analysts dilemma of too much information and inadequate tools to deal with it.  MindSnaps are envisioned as a tool to provide analysts the ability to cut through the opaque information space, discover what is important, store it for future analysis, and recall/reload it later as needed with changes highlighted.  MindSnaps are enablers to help analysts make information associations and build upon them to test hypothesis and recognize increasingly complex patterns of relationships that may have significance to the intelligence community.

The analytic process is inherently iterative and fractionated.  The analyst will typically think about one aspect of analytic problem until it is no longer fruitful, new data comes in, or a new facet of the problem becomes more salient.  Analytic decision making is iterative because the analyst will often return to a previous point in his or her thinking and resume analysis from that point in time until a solution is found to the analytic problem.  We believe that it will be possible to monitor an analysts workflow, and detect when the analyst has shifted their decision trajectory while engaged in this fractionated process. When a shift in decision trajectory is detected, the system would collect meta-data regarding the analysts workspace including what software applications were in use, where they were located and the data sets open in those applications.  Further, by examining the work that was being done before the decision trajectory shifted, it should be possible to extract meta-knowledge about what the analyst was doing during that period of analysis. The meta-knowledge would become the basis for creating a meaningful abstraction to summarize that decision trajectory. Together, the meta-data about the workspace and the meta-knowledge data would be combined to create a MindSnap. MindSnaps will be the basis for the creation of mental bookmarks of an analysts decision making.  A-SpaceX seeks to develop a research thrust that explores creating a synthetic world that will facilitate these processes.  

MindSnaps will be the foundation for developing a "Decision Space" synthetic world that maps the overall decision-making processes of analysts as graphical decision nodes, and allows them to find and, cognitively re-load their workstation from different points in their own analytic process.  

Conclusion.  
An A-SpaceX Phase 1 Industry Day will be held on July 8, 2008 from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm at the University of Maryland (UMD) Samuel Riggs IV Alumni Center located on Alumni Drive, College Park, MD. Sign in will begin at 8:00 AM  and the government briefing will begin at 9:00AM.  The briefing and all discussions will be UNCLASSIFIED.

Additionally, our intent is to provide access via a web simulcast and via Second Life (details provided upon request). The purpose of the Industry Day is to provide the A-SpaceX vision and concepts / ideas that may appear in the BAA scheduled for release on or about July 15th. Following this presentation, there will be a general Q&A session. The afternoon of July 8th is being reserved for 15 minute private conversations with the A-SpaceX team  by appointment only. The purpose of the private conversations is to allow for general discussions relating to the A-SpaceX BAA. We will not be discussing what potential offerors specifically plan to propose.  Please contact Peter Rocci (contact information below) if you are interested in attending as well as requesting a private conversation. In the event that time constraints do not permit a private conversation, a 15 minute conference call will be scheduled with the A-SpaceX team before the scheduled BAA release date on or about July 15th, 2008.

We cannot control the types of problems that future analysts might face. We cannot control the demands for understanding information and the pressure for faster decision making. We can, however, provide the analyst with an environment that encourages creativity, reasoning, collaboration with internal and external experts, rapid exploration of alternate perspectives for greater understanding, and detecting change in data and through processes within a multi-dimensional information rich synthetic world. Welcome to A-SpaceX where its about the future.

THIS IS AN INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and NO contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.

<DESC><p>THIS REQUIREMENT IS SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AS PER FAR CLAUSE 52.232-18. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) intends to enter into a sole-source contract with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) for the purpose of purchasing faremedia, specifically Metrocheks and SmartBenefits. The period of performance will include a Base Period beginning October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009, and four (4) additional one-year Option Periods, which may be exercised. The Sole-source determination is in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1. The WMATA is the only locally funded entity authorized to plan, develop, build, finance and operate a transportation system within the National Capital Region (NCR). The WMATA transportation system, which consists of Metrobus, Metrorail and MetroAccess, currently covers the District of Columbia, the suburban Maryland counties of Montgomery and Prince George's and the Northern Virginia counties of Arlington, Fairfax and Loudoun and the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax and Falls Church. The faremedia that the WMATA currently uses in its transportation system is Metrocheks and SmartBenefits. <br />Overview of the procurement: Executive Order 13150, "Federal Workforce Transportation", dated April 21, 2000 required Federal agencies to implement a "transit pass" transportation fringe benefit program in order to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. Under this program, qualified Federal employees may receive faremedia (e.g. passes, tokens, farecards, or vouchers) for transportation on mass transit facilities in amounts approximately equal to their commuting costs, not to exceed the maximum level allowed by law [Currently the maximum amount allowed by law is $115.00]. In accordance with this authority the Department of the Treasury issued a Directive, Directive 74-10, "Public Transportation Program", dated November 3, 2000, which provided the policy, procedures and guidelines for its Bureaus and offices to establish such a program. As a result of this Directive, the BEP developed and currently operates and administers a Public Transportation Program for its employee within the NCR. Therefore, the BEP requires the purchase of Metrocheks and SmartBenefits from the WMATA to support this initiative and its program.

<DESC>Questions and AnswersSolicitation Number VA-259-08-RP-0146Havre CBOCQuestion 1: Page 7 under the NOTE, section sates: For each contract option year the enrolled patient must receive a minimum of one office visit before receiving payment for the option year.  Page 8, paragraph 2, states: The contractor(s) will be paid for the full contract year at the time of the initial visit.  For disenrolled patients, the contractor will be paid a pro-rata portion up to the full month in which the date of disenrollment occurred.  Disenrolled is defined as not seen by the contractor provided for a period of two years (24 months).a.	For clarification purposes, must the enrolled patient be seen yearly in order to receive the payments for the option year even though the patient is not disenrolled until they have not been seen for two years?Answer 1:  I am not sure of the question that you are asking.  For example, in the schedule the contractor will provided a price of per patient per month and a price per patient per year.  Per the solicitation, for each contract option year, the enrolled patient must receive a minimum of one office visit before receiving payment for the option year.  The Contractor will get paid for that veteran through 2 years even if he is only seen one time.  As long as the veteran is enrolled, payment will be made.  Question 2: Page 23, Section F, Paragraph 2, states: The VA will provide clerical staff for the veterans and primary care providers.  This VA clerk will work full-time with primary responsibilities to the VA.  Coverage for extended pre-planned annual leave and sick leave will be negotiated with and provided by VA staff from other Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs).  Sick or annual leave coverage of a less extensive nature will be provided by the contract clerical assistant and the individual primary care support staff with follow-up by the assigned VA clerk upon his/her return.a.	Will the contracted provider have any input in the selection of the VA Clerk?Answer 2a: No.  The clerical position is considered a full time employee who works for the VA  VA employee.  The position is advertised and hired by the VA Human Resources department.  No authority, but value input.b.	This is the only reference to the contract clerical assistant.  Does the VA expect the contracted provider to employ this individual?  Or may the contracted provided supply sick and annual leave coverage of a less extensive nature by utilizing personnel?Answer 2b: The clerical position is a VA employee who is located at the Havre CBOC and an employee of the VA.  This is a full time position that is hired and paid by the VA  just like any other VA employee and the clerical position is entitled to benefits provided by the VA (sick and annual leave).  If the VA clerk is gone for emergent leave, the contract staff may need to take messages until the clerk returns.  The contractor may use personnel to take messages.  Question 3: Page 25, Paragraph 2 states: The VA shall be responsible for maintenance and on-going technical support for all VA provided IT hardware, software and peripherals.a.	What is the type and nature of the software training and support the VA will provide?Answer 3a: Any VA owned IT hardware and software; the VA will provide to the contractor and VA staff the necessary training to utilize those products.  This includes for example the VA software package called CPRS and VISTA.Question 4: Page 27, Paragraph 2(b) states: Records created by Contractor in course of performing this agreement are the property of the VA and shall not be accessed, released, transferred, or destroyed except in accordance with applicable federal law, regulations, and policy.  Access to the date will be limited to the minimum necessary for performance of the contract.  Contractor will take steps to ensure that access is limited to those employees who need access to the data to perform the contract.  Contractor will not copy information contained in the system, either by printing to paper or by copying to another digital format, without the express permission of one of the officials listed in paragraph (b), above, except as is necessary to make single copies in the ordinary course of providing patient care.  Contractor will not commingle the data from the system with information form other sources.a.	Due to the remote location and distance from other providers and in order to provide seamless continuity of care to the veterans, may the Contractors allow access to the VA Computerized Record System to the Northern Montana Hospital Emergency Room Physicians for further patient care in the event of a Veteran presenting to the ER for emergency services?Answer 4a:  No.  The VA has a process in place to release records to ERs if needed.Question 5: Page 28, Section J, Paragraph I states: The contracted provider must document all care provided in the VA Computerized Record System (CPRS) following VA policy, Department of Veterans Affairs, Center Circular No: 11-08-06 found in Part III  Contract Documents, Exhibits and Attachments  Attachment C.a.	May the Contracted provider utilize the services for a scribe, for input into the VA Computerized Record System (CPRS)?Answer 5a:  No, and a scribe cannot be used.Question 6: Please provide clarification regarding the Detailed Medical Exam, Enrollment Exam, and Initial Visit.Answer 6:  Please refer to page 20 of the solicitation.  Each new patient will receive a comprehensive history and physical at the first visit.  This visit will meet the criteria for specific CPT codes (99203, 99204, 99205, 99213, 99214, and 99215) and will include an EKG, chest x-ray, and baseline lab work (CBC, UA, and Chem profile). A problem list will be developed from information obtained during the H&P. The problem list will contain active problems and annotation of any past major procedures and must be updated to maintain currency. Established patients will receive a problem focused history and physical annually.Question 7:  How are patients initially assigned to the Havre CBOC?Answer 7: After the enrollment and are seen once by the clinic, they are assigned into a VA Database by VA Clerk.Question 8: If a patient is enrolled at another VA Facility and seeks services at the Havre CBOC how is this transfer facilitated?Answer 8:  Veteran makes an appointment and transfer is completed in VA Database by the VA Clerk to Havre CBOC and care provider is assigned.Question 9:  What is the estimated contract start date?Answer 9:  On page 23, G. Contract Start-up Requirements:  The contractor shall comply with the following contract requirements within 30 days of the Date of the Notice to Proceed.  Solicitation is due on 7/3/08.  Evaluation will take approximately one week.  Anticipate award being made on approximately 7/14/08.  VA will need to plan for installation of VA IT equipment and CPRS training also. Please see question 30  due date has been changed.   Question 10: Will contract be a 12 month base period as stated on page 19 of the solicitation or less than one year as stated on page 6?Answer 10:  The base year of the contract is date of contract award to September 30, 2008.  There are four option years to be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  For example, option year 1 begins October 1, 2008 and end September 30, 2009 and so on.Question 11: Where are the current enrollees treated?  Answer 11:  The current enrollees may be treated at other VAs that may include the contract clinics, VA clinics, private sector or IHS.  Currently enrollees are any veteran enrolled in the VA.   Question 12:  Are all current services provided by the Government?  Are there any contract providers treating these enrollees?Answer 12:  Treatment may be offered in private sector authorized by the VA, may use the VA or use the private sector and not utilize the VA at all.  Question 13:  What the current number of enrollees?Answer 13:  As stated in the solicitation on page 9, there is an estimated population of 4,325 veterans in the area which includes seven different counties identified in the solicitation, but not limited to those counties.  The schedule has estimates of patients per year.  These are estimates only and it is difficult to determine the number of enrollees for the area.  Question 14: What were the average number of enrollees between 1/1/07 and 6/4/08?Answer 14:  Since this is a new clinic, I do not know the average number of enrollees between those dates.  Please be more specific if you are asking outside of Havre.    Question 15: Will these current enrollees carry over as currently enrolled or will they first require an initial/annual visit as stated on page 7 Note?Answer 15:  Please refer to the solicitation on page 8 defining disenrolled.  Once a patient is enrolled and continues, they are not re-enrolled, but will be paid for the first initial exam.   Question 16: Please clarify NOTE on page 7 of solicitation.  Will the Government pay contractor a price per enrollee per month for all enrollees who have been treated in the past 12 months or yearly payment for each new annual visit/enrollment?  The wording of the NOTE leads one to believe that each option year starts with zero enrollees.  Is this correct?Answer 16:  The schedule shows per patient per month price and per patient per year price, with an estimated quantity and capitated rate. Question 17: Please define what is meant by routine radiology services on page 21 of the solicitation.  Will all radiology films be read by the contractors radiologist?  Will anything other than flat films be required such as fluoroscopy and barium enemas?Answer 17: Yes, only exclusions that are not included in the contract are listed in paragraph 10.  The remaining radiology services will be provided by the contractor.  Question 18: Will chest x-rays be required for any currently enrolled patients?Answer 18: If indicated. Question 19: Are there currently any females enrolled?  Are there any females anticipated during the course of the contract?  Will mammography for males and females be required as part of the contract?  Answer 19:   Yes. Yes and included in contract.Question 20: On page 6 and 7 of the solicitation, it refers to 10 enrollment exams for each year of the contract.  How do these differ from the all new enrollments since the government project significantly higher enrollment growth?Answer 20: The numbers provided for the enrollment exams are estimated only and those numbers could very well fluctuate.  At this time, that is strictly an estimate.  We are projecting an estimated growth of 167 new enrollees from first to second year and from the second to third year and not sure of outlying years.   Question 21: Can contractor order immunizations and other injectables through the VA at government expense or will contractor bare all cost?Answer 21: The VA provides influenza and pneumonia vaccine (VA pays).Question 22: Page 30 states: The provider shall refer the patient to the RN Liaison to release records; the contract shall provide the patient with a blank VA Form 5345.a.	Where will the RN Liaison be physically located, and is the Liaison a government employee or a contractor employee?Answer 22a:  The location is the service at Fort Harrison and is referred to as Release of Information a government employee.Question 23:  Will the VA interpret the x-ray images or is that part of the services expected to be provided by the CBOC?  If the VA Radiologist interprets the exam do you use PACS?Answer 23:  The CBOC does the reading and yes we use PACs at VA Montana.  If we want to capture those images into our system, we can do it several ways.  Question 24: Reference pages 6 and 7 of the solicitation.  The solicitation schedule includes a line item, number 0002, for enrollment exam.  Does the enrollment exam apply to all patients enrolled to the Havre CBOC or only to patients that are new to the VA system?

<DESC>The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is developing a Smart Battery Status Monitor (SBSM) to ascertain the state-of-health of energy storage technologies for multiple applications (e.g., automotive, military, space, etc.).  A key component of the SBSM is accurate, in-situ measurements of impedance.  INL and its collaborating partners have patent positions on a couple of unique approaches to determine impedance in near real-time.  These techniques are critical for accurate state-of-health prognostics in the overall SBSM, but could also be useful as stand-alone devices (e.g., acceptance testing in the field).   The INL is seeking industrial collaboration and funding to advance the development of the SBSM from a conceptual state to a pre-commercial prototype.  Industrial participant(s) will have a right to seek up to an exclusive, field of use license to commercialize the SBSM technology.  Additional information is available under nondisclosure agreement.  Interested parties should provide a written response to the INL on or before August 31, 2008.  Technical Contact:  Jon P.

Hatch Worldwide is the current maker of the Combat Glove and is the only firm that has a FAT approved glove, that has been field tested and evaluated and that has the necessary materials on hand that can meet this immediate requirement.  This modification is necessary to ensure that the U.S. Army has sufficient quantities of gloves for fielding in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.  This increase is only a bridge buy to provide PM Soldier with enough gloves for fielding while a new Full and Open Solicitation is prepared for release for October of 2008. The North American Industry Classification System Identifier for this procurement is 315992; the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.  This notice expires 03 July 2008. Questions concerning this synopsis can be directed to Kevin Parker, Contract Specialist, at kevin.james.parker@us.army.mil.

Data files from the new TGA and TMA must be able to be opened and overlaid with our existing DSC and DMA instrument.  <BR><BR>Thermogravimetric Analyzer Specifications<BR><BR>Temperature Range:  The TGA instrument must allow for a measurable temperature range of ambient to 1200C<BR><BR>Heating Rate Range:  The instrument will be used for kinetics analyses, a wide range of achievable heating rates is critical.  The instrument must be able to have linear, controlled, heating rates from 0.1C/min to 500C/min.  These are controlled rates, not instantaneous or ballistic rates.  These heating rates are necessary to our work and unique to this instrument by virtue of its infrared heating furnace system.<BR><BR>Balance Sensitivity:  The TGA balance must have a sensitivity of at least 0.1 mg (microgram).  <BR>Balance Baseline Performance:  Applications call for the highest sensitivity of the TGA signal.  The TGA baseline must exhibit less than 10 mg (microgram) of drift over the temperature range ambient to 1000C.  This drift is uncorrected, raw, performance and is not the drift after calibration, baseline subtraction, or other software manipulations.  The TGA isothermal baseline must drift no more than 5 mg (microgram) over 18 hours (uncorrected).<BR><BR>Purge Gas Control:  The TGA must include digital mass flow controllers for at least two separate purge gases, such that the purge gas can be automatically switched via software during the experiment.  The flow rate must also be adjustable via software during an experiment.  The flow rates must be data logged into the resulting data file.<BR><BR>Robotic Autosampler/Pan Punching:  Because this instrument will be used extensively, and often on a 24 hour basis, it must come equipped with a robotic autosampler containing at least 20 sample positions.  The autosampler must include a pan punching mechanism, by which samples can be kept sealed in a hermetic environment, and punched open just prior to loading.  This pan punching must produce a large breach in the pan, rather than a pin-hole, as our materials rely on efficient sample/gas interaction.<BR><BR>Variable Rate Control:  The TGA instrument must include some form of automatic variable rate control to improve resolution.  The heating rate must be continuously adjusted as a function of sample mass loss rate, as opposed to a stepwise isothermal approach.   <BR><BR>Automatic Calibration:  The TGA instrument must allow for automatic, unattended calibration of both temperature (curie-point standards) and mass. No operator intervention of any kind should be needed once the weight and temperature calibration routine is started.  These calibrations must be programmable and schedulable from within the operating software.<BR>The software must also be capable of sending automatic communications as to the status of these calibration/verification experiments, either by email or instant messaging, so that the operator is fully apprised of their status.  <BR>In addition, the instrument software must be capable of performing auto-diagnostic tests through the scheduling component.  These tests must verify the performance of various instrument components such as autosampler motors, electronic boards, mass flow controllers, etc.  The results of these tests must be logged and the option to automatically report the result via email or instant messaging should be included.  <BR><BR>Software:  As this TGA will be used by multiple researchers, it is critical that the analysis software be installed on multiple computers.  As such, the analysis program must be un-keyed, and must include a site license such that it may be installed on an unlimited number of computers within US Army Natick.  The data file format must easily allow sharing/transfer of data files as individual electronic documents, which are readable by the same data analysis package.  The data analysis program also includes a .pdf generator, for the efficient export of analyzed plots.  <BR><BR>The operating software must also be capable of periodically and automatically checking for updates via an internet connection, and downloading/installing those updates if desired.<BR><BR>The TGA software must be able to read Thermo-Nicolet IR Graham-Schmidt plots directly and overlay them with the TGA data.<BR> <BR>Thermomechanical Analyzer Specifications<BR><BR><BR>"	Temperature range:  -150 to 1200C<BR>"	Temperature precision: +/- 1<BR>"	Heating rate range 0.1 to 100C/min.<BR>"	Isothermal temperature control of 0.1C<BR>"	Furnace cool-down time: less than 10 minutes from 600C to 50C<BR>"	Measurement Precision: +/- 0.1%<BR>"	Sensitivity:  15nm<BR>"	Resolution (digital): 0.15 nm<BR>"	Dynamic baseline drift: less than1 m (-100 to 500C)<BR>"	Force range: 0.001 to 1 N (2N using additional weights)<BR>"	Force Resolution: 0.001 N<BR><BR>In addition to the above specifications, the TMA must be capable of being upgraded with the following features:<BR><BR>"	Ability to perform dynamic TMA tests and generate material viscoelastic properties (storage modulus, loss modulus, tan delta i.e A sinusoidal force (stress) is applied during a temperature ramp. Analysis of the resulting strain and phase data provides viscoelastic property parameters e.g., E, E tan ).<BR><BR>"	Ability to perform Modulated TMA: Temperature is programmed linearly, and simultaneously modulated at constant stress to generate signals relating to total displacement, CTE, and their reversing and non-reversing components. These permit detection of thermal transitions, and separation of overlapping events (e.g., Tg and stress relaxation).<BR><BR>"	Ability to generate temperature steps / ramps at constant strain, and constant force, plus force steps and ramps at constant temperature <BR><BR>"	Ability in enter sample geometry factors to compute rheological signals <BR><BR>"	Ability  to generate temperature steps / ramps at constant strain, and constant stress, plus  stress ramps at constant temperature <BR><BR>"	Ability to perform stress and strain steps / ramps at constant temperature <BR><BR>"	Ability to perform creep and stress relaxation measurements, with capability to compute creep and stress relaxation data in rheological units (%strain, creep compliance, recoverable compliance, relaxation modulus.<BR><BR><BR>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, via e-mail at stephen.abate@us.army.mil.

The Hewlett Packard DL380G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580G4 SMART servers, along with these other components, have been identified as key components of the Departments SMART server infrastructure. IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified networks. These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility. These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel. In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time. As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing O&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed. Furthermore, these setups are matched to specific configuration needs in the DoS that recur on a regular basis making them virtually interchangeable and simplifying our spare part logistic needs. Finally, standardization preserves our ability to more easily expand with newer server models from the same manufacturer and achieve economies of scale, particularly in test and development environments, with lower overall cost.<BR><BR>Required Hewlett Packard DL380G5, Hewlett Packard DL580 G4, servers, and related infrastructure equipment (described above and in the attached) are required for SMART. These servers have been identified as key components of the Departments SMART server infrastructure which will provide Command and Control message handling, collaboration, Archive and Records Management functions for the Department of State. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The Hewlett Packard DL380G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.

(ix)  The provision at 52.212-1, Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will offer the best value to the Government, technical factors, price, and past performance considered.  To determine technical merit, each quotation will be evaluated against the technical evaluation factors. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are listed in descending order of importance.  1) Technical Understanding and Approach.  The proposed technology will be evaluated on its ability to be successfully implemented into FDAs standard environment and the use of the technology.  Contractors shall furnish as part of their quotation all descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether their service meets the technical requirements.  The technical proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, Minimally Acceptable, Acceptable, or Exceptional.  A score of Minimally Acceptable would mean that the proposed technology minimally met the requirements and demonstrated to be difficult to implement.   A score of Acceptable would mean that the proposed technology fully met the requirements and demonstrated its ability to be implemented.  A score of Exceptional would mean that the proposed technology exceeded the requirements and would be easy to implement.  2) Price.  Price is of less importance than technical capabilities and past performance combined.  Award will not be automatically made on the basis of the highest technical merit. However price may become an important factor as the degree of equality between technical proposals becomes closer.  3) Past performance -Offeror should provide three references of similar efforts performed during the last three years. This will include a description of the project, project title, contract number, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official name(s), address and telephone number.

The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offerors likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offerors past performance record.  Rating of positive, neutral, and poor will be given.  A positive past performance will take precedence over neutral or poor past performance.  Neutral past performance takes precedence over poor past performance.  A contractor with no past performance will be given a score of neutral, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offerors likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offerors record of past performance.  The Government intends to issue one firm fixed award for this requirement.  The Government reserves the right to make award without discussions.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

VI. STATEMENT OF WORK

INTERPRETING SERVICES FOR DEAF COUNTERFEIT SPECIALIST 

BACKGROUND

The U.S. Secret Service in Washington, D.C. has a deaf Counterfeit Specialist in need of a dedicated sign language interpreter to be on the premises on a full-time basis to meet the employee's communication needs.

OBJECTIVE

To procure the services of a contractor for interpreting services, to enable the U.S. Secret Service to provide effective communication between the deaf Counterfeit Specialist and individuals within the Secret Service as well as individuals from external sources.

QUALIFICATIONS

Interpreters contracted to work for the U.S. Secret Service must be Qualified/Certified members in good standing with the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID). These individuals must demonstrate high competence in and knowledge of ASL and transliteration. The contractor shall be able to understand, translate, and interpret technical terminology, laws, regulations, concepts, principles, practices, and procedures applicable to the Secret Service. Interpreting in legal or classified environments is highly desirable. Interpreters must possess knowledge of the Deaf Community and Deaf Culture. In addition, they must have obtained an education pertaining to the interpreting profession, and have a minimum of three years experience. 

The primary interpreter, and anyone backfilling in their absence during courtroom assignments, must be able to understand and interpret/translate legal terminology, and be qualified to perform in a courtroom setting.

Contractors must submit their resumes and a copy of RID certification with their proposal. Failure to submit these items will deem the contractor non-responsive and have the proposal rejected.

CLEARANCE

The interpreters must have a Top Secret security clearance.

SCOPE OF WORK

The contractor will provide dedicated, on-call sign language interpreting services on Mondays through Fridays from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. for the deaf Counterfeit Specialist. The services provided will be professional in nature and will be in accordance with the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf Code of Conduct. Under no circumstances will the interpreter represent the U.S. Secret Service or act as an official spokesperson on behalf of the agency.

In the event that the primary contractor is unable to perform as scheduled, the contractor shall arrange (in advance if possible) for a replacement interpreter, meeting the minimum requirements of the contract and possessing any clearances required for the assignment. This will include sick and vacation days. In such situations, payment of the replacement interpreter will be the responsibility of the contractor. The substituting interpreter must be RID certified and qualified. The Secret Service will not pay the contractor for Federal holidays that fall within their regular scheduled days, for days the Government closes for inclement weather, or for days that the deaf Counterfeit Specialist is on leave and the contractor has been provided a 48-hour notice. Some training/functions may require additional interpreters; however, notice will be given when there is a need.

Intermittent interpreting services may also be required from the contractor. Intermittent services are defined as services required in addition to the dedicated on-call position. The contractor shall provide interpreters who have appropriate clearances and qualifications, on an as-needed basis to satisfy this requirement. Examples of intermittent services include:
     Interpreting assignments that are expected to exceed the standard period that an interpreter works continuously without a team, and based upon professional discretion, the contractor shall consult with the Supervisory Counterfeit Specialist to determine if an additional interpreter is necessary.
       Other situations that require additional contracted personnel are those assignments that are two days or longer in duration (i.e. certain travel, instruction, training, conferences, and courtroom testimony).

The U.S. Government Standards of Conduct also applies.

The U.S. Secret Service will provide the necessary equipment and supplies needed for performance of duties.

MAJOR DUTIES

       Interpret effectively into English and ASL to facilitate effective communication between the deaf Counterfeit Specialist and other individuals.
       Interpret in all settings where services are required. Possible settings may include training classes, presentations, courtrooms, one-on-one meetings with supervisors, managers and employees, staff meetings and interviews.
       Provide consultation to managers/supervisors concerning the profession of sign language interpreting.
       Maintain involvement in the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) and other professionally related organizations and/or training programs.
       Work closely with the U.S. Secret Service Contracting Officer Technical Representative concerning scheduling and/or matters relating to the provisions for services at U.S. Secret Service.
       Maintain professional conduct, dress, and manner.

REQUESTS AND CANCELLATIONS

When possible, the schedule for daily interpreting services as well as preparation materials will be provided to the contractor in advance of the activity. Cancellation for daily on-call services as well as intermittent services will be provided to the contractor a minimum of 48 business hours in advance of the scheduled assignment.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

All documents (both hard and soft copy) that are produced during the duration of the contract by the contractor for the government shall be considered government property and shall be provided back to the government upon termination of the contract, or upon request.

GUIDELINES

Guidelines consist of the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) Code of Conduct, the operational policies of the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, the regulations set forth in Sections 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended. The contractor shall keep all documentation and information pertaining to the services they provide within the laws covering the Privacy Act, and shall consider all activity to be confidential in nature when servicing the Agency or individuals. 

TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS

The contractor will be required to provide interpreting services to the deaf Counterfeit Specialist located at U.S. Secret Service Headquarters in Washington, D.C. The contractor must be willing to travel to other sites within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area as needed to include southern Maryland. Local travel, within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area will be the responsibility of the contractor. 

The contractor shall be available for domestic and foreign travel with the deaf Counterfeit Specialist to provide interpreting services for meetings, presentations, training, conferences, and expert witness trial testimony. Travel will be arranged through invitational travel.

This is a long-term effort that will require the formulation of detailed proposals for the development of a national SI policy and the development and dissemination of technical and administrative guidance documents. Incumbent is central to this effort and will be required to monitor and evaluate progress, to make adjustments of project impact and outcome, and to carefully document the results.</p>
<p>15. Incumbent provides highly technical and strategic advice to PEPFAR colleagues, relevant ministries, and implementing partners related to the development and monitoring of SI systems for management tracking, supervision and evaluation of PEPFAR program progress. Assists in formulation of annual and strategic plans for overall program direction.

<p>For PEPFAR Executive Team and CDC Country Director:<br />16. Provides advice on Strategic Information and monitoring, informatics, and SI systems training requirements; on improvement of program quality through development of SI protocols, procedure manuals and quality assurance instruments; and, on identification of consultants for specific SI program activities.</p>
<p>For other PEPFAR partners<br />17. Reports to the TWG on the progress and outcomes of SI program data and information and makes suggestions to ensure a highly effective integrated approach. Since SI is a crosscutting area for all prevention, care and treatment programs, data this program collects and analyzes will show the effectiveness of program interventions, such as referral systems to other services offered by other programs. Advice and recommendations are made in order to improve overall program quality as well as effective supervision and quality assurance.</p>
<p>For subordinates and colleagues:<br />18. Provides advice and recommendations on improving SI program quality, including training, implementing and monitoring field activities. As an example, provides advice and suggestions, when finding out from monitoring and quality assurance (Q/A) visits that provincial staff do not understand the importance of accurately collecting, collating, analyzing and presenting program data in a way that will assist them to identify problems, and from there negotiates and suggests solutions to ensure a high quality program.</p>
<p>For national and international organizations:<br />19. As the nationally recognized expert on SI systems, provides recommendations on the development of state-of-the-art methods and practices. Major decisions related to SI program changes will be on the basis of advice, counsel and guidance provided by incumbent.</p>
<p>20. Incumbent's technical support on SI aspects of prevention, care and treatment projects, as well as his/her provision of valuable information needed for improvement of program implementation, has a high level of impact on PEPFAR and CDC activities in Cote d'Ivoire. For example, incumbent works with the Prevention, Care and Treatment, and Strategic Information technical working groups to assure that effective program indicators for laboratory testing and training requirements are incorporated into their programs.</p>
<p>21. Incumbent's activities have a significant impact on the formulation and delivery of SI services within Cote d'Ivoire. The need for directional change in the delivery of SI services requires an individual with strong persuasive skills who is recognized and respected for hi/her professional skills in SI systems development. The potential change to be brought about by the incumbent in this position could potentially affect the delivery of SI services for decades. This, in turn, affects the ability of programs that depend on SI results to be strengthened.</p>
<p>Working Environment:</p>
<p>Basic office environment (85% of time), and field clinical settings (15% of time) as incumbent oversees the work of others.</p>
<p>Incumbent routinely has multiple projects underway simultaneously with competing project deadlines. This situation may lead to stress.</p>
<p>The incumbent may have to work outside official hours in order to meet deadlines, or for routine travel or work away from duty station.</p>
<p>The incumbent may experience regular and moderate levels of job-related stress from demanding activities and occasional tight timeframes, or from frequent queries from project and CDC staff to explain, clarify and otherwise assist in the understanding of Project Management activities or process results. The need to meet tight deadlines and produce data and reports for use by senior CDC and host country officials also may induce psychologically demanding stress.</p>
<p>Frequent travel, such as day trips several times a week, throughout Abidjan and throughout Cote d' Ivoire on a monthly basis - working away from duty station represents a moderate to moderately high degree of disruption to work patterns (or what the next level of disruption is).</p>

This is a long-term effort that will require the formulation of detailed proposals for the development of a national SI policy and the development and dissemination of technical and administrative guidance documents. Incumbent is central to this effort and will be required to monitor and evaluate progress, to make adjustments of project impact and outcome, and to carefully document the results.</p>
<p>15. Incumbent provides highly technical and strategic advice to PEPFAR colleagues, relevant ministries, and implementing partners related to the development and monitoring of SI systems for management tracking, supervision and evaluation of PEPFAR program progress.

<p>For PEPFAR Executive Team and CDC Country Director:<br />16. Provides advice on Strategic Information and monitoring, informatics, and SI systems training requirements; on improvement of program quality through development of SI protocols, procedure manuals and quality assurance instruments; and, on identification of consultants for specific SI program activities.</p>
<p>For other PEPFAR partners<br />17. Reports to the TWG on the progress and outcomes of SI program data and information and makes suggestions to ensure a highly effective integrated approach. Since SI is a crosscutting area for all prevention, care and treatment programs, data this program collects and analyzes will show the effectiveness of program interventions, such as referral systems to other services offered by other programs. Advice and recommendations are made in order to improve overall program quality as well as effective supervision and quality assurance.</p>
<p>For subordinates and colleagues:<br />18. Provides advice and recommendations on improving SI program quality, including training, implementing and monitoring field activities. As an example, provides advice and suggestions, when finding out from monitoring and quality assurance (Q/A) visits that provincial staff do not understand the importance of accurately collecting, collating, analyzing and presenting program data in a way that will assist them to identify problems, and from there negotiates and suggests solutions to ensure a high quality program.</p>
<p>For national and international organizations:<br />19. As the nationally recognized expert on SI systems, provides recommendations on the development of state-of-the-art methods and practices. Major decisions related to SI program changes will be on the basis of advice, counsel and guidance provided by incumbent.</p>
<p>20. Incumbent's technical support on SI aspects of prevention, care and treatment projects, as well as his/her provision of valuable information needed for improvement of program implementation, has a high level of impact on PEPFAR and CDC activities in Cote d'Ivoire. For example, incumbent works with the Prevention, Care and Treatment, and Strategic Information technical working groups to assure that effective program indicators for laboratory testing and training requirements are incorporated into their programs.</p>
<p>21. Incumbent's activities have a significant impact on the formulation and delivery of SI services within Cote d'Ivoire. The need for directional change in the delivery of SI services requires an individual with strong persuasive skills who is recognized and respected for hi/her professional skills in SI systems development. The potential change to be brought about by the incumbent in this position could potentially affect the delivery of SI services for decades. This, in turn, affects the ability of programs that depend on SI results to be strengthened.</p>
<p>Working Environment:</p>
<p>Basic office environment (85% of time), and field clinical settings (15% of time) as incumbent oversees the work of others.</p>
<p>Incumbent routinely has multiple projects underway simultaneously with competing project deadlines. This situation may lead to stress.</p>
<p>The incumbent may have to work outside official hours in order to meet deadlines, or for routine travel or work away from duty station.</p>
<p>The incumbent may experience regular and moderate levels of job-related stress from demanding activities and occasional tight timeframes, or from frequent queries from project and CDC staff to explain, clarify and otherwise assist in the understanding of Project Management activities or process results. The need to meet tight deadlines and produce data and reports for use by senior CDC and host country officials also may induce psychologically demanding stress.</p>
<p>Frequent travel, such as day trips several times a week, throughout Abidjan and throughout Cote d' Ivoire on a monthly basis - working away from duty station represents a moderate to moderately high degree of disruption to work patterns (or what the next level of disruption is).</p>

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation has been extended to July 3, 2008 at 11am.  The NCI-Office of Acquisition has received questions regarding this solicitation.

Question 1:   The stock you have listed for the case bound cover is a Kivar #6 Graphic White, Chrome Finish.   Kivar 6 does not come in a Graphic White or a Chrome Finish.  Are you looking for a leatherette-type sheet here, or just a standard white sheet:  

Answer 1 part 1: A standard white sheet is appropriate for case binding.

Secondly, I don't see anywhere what stock the endsheets should be on.  Will this be the Kivar as well?

Answer 1 part 2:  Endleaves (for case-bound copies) and covers 2-3 (for perfect bound) 
print in PMS-2726 with reversed to white type matter.   End-leaves are usually 80# text paper, but the grain direction may matter. The contractor, should confirm with their binder (which is most appropriate and use that substrate).

(End of provision)

Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the 
ADDENDA TO FAR 52.212-4
                          CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONSCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (Feb 2007)

Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment 1 is to answer questions.

Question: Will there be a DD254 and what are the requirements?
Question: Is a facility clearance required?
Question: Do you expect the interpreter to have security clearance prior to the commencement of the contract? If not, would you accept proposal with a qualified interpreter that could begin the security clearance process upon beginning of contract?

Answers: A DD Form 254 (facility clearance for the firm) will be required for contract award. All personnel working under this requirement must be U.S. citizens and possess a minimum level Top Secret Defense Security Service (DSS), Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) or equivalent clearance.

The individual presented for performance of services must pass a background check as determined by the U.S. Secret Service. All contractor personnel assigned to this contact shall meet the following minimum qualifications:
1. The firm providing the personnel must hold a minimum level Secret facility clearance upon award. 
2. All personnel working under this requirement must be U.S. citizens, and shall be required to possess a minimum level Secret Defense Security Service (DSS), Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) or equivalent clearance. Documentation will be required to confirm such clearances, including date of clearance issuance, the Cage Code, a DSS/DISCO point of contact, and the address of the cognizant security office. 
3. All personnel will be working on the Government site and shall complete a Contractor Personnel Access Application form (SSF 3237), and must undergo a security background check by the USSS. The contractor shall provide personnel who can successfully pass the background investigation. 
4. Prior to award, the successful awardee shall be required to provide the name and contact information for the Contract Security Representative (CSR) of their firm. The CSR shall be the contact between the contractor and the USSS. The CSR shall handle all forms necessary to obtain security clearances and access approvals. 

Since Contractor personnel shall be required to have a Secret level clearance, the offeror must submit the following documents and others as required for each respective person immediately prior to award:
 
a. Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
b. SSF 3237 - Contractor Personnel Access Application (see Attachment 1)
c. SSF 4024 - Conditional Access to Sensitive But Unclassified Information Nondisclosure Agreement (see Attachment 2) 
d. Provide evidence of the required security clearance for proposed personnel before beginning work. 
 
Question: Is sub-contracting allowed?
Answer: Subcontracting is permitted, but the resume and qualifications of each interpreter must be submitted with the proposal.

Question: Would the sub-contractor be required to have a facility clearance?
Answer: Yes, the clearance requirements apply both to the prime and subcontractor.

Question: Will you accept a proposal with a few interpreters that we feel may suit this type of requirement?
Answer: USSS encourages multiple interpreters; USSS must review resumes and qualifications of all relevant interpreters. The offeror may propose a bank or pool of cleared interpreters to ensure full time coverage of interpretation services.

<DESC>The purpose of amendment 2 is to clarify the question about clearance in amendment 1 and to answer an additional question.
The following question is clarified from amendment 1, note that contractor personnel are to have a Top Secret clearance (the Top is now emphasized by astericks where missing before).
Question: Will there be a DD254 and what are the requirements?
Question: Is a facility clearance required?
Question: Do you expect the interpreter to have security clearance prior to the commencement of the contract? If not, would you accept proposal with a qualified interpreter that could begin the security clearance process upon beginning of contract?

Answers: A DD Form 254 (facility clearance for the firm) will be required for contract award. All personnel working under this requirement must be U.S. citizens and possess a minimum level Top Secret Defense Security Service (DSS), Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) or equivalent clearance.

The individual presented for performance of services must pass a background check as determined by the U.S. Secret Service. All contractor personnel assigned to this contact shall meet the following minimum qualifications:
1. The firm providing the personnel must hold a minimum level Secret facility clearance upon award. 
2. All personnel working under this requirement must be U.S. citizens, and shall be required to possess a minimum level *Top* Secret Defense Security Service (DSS), Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) or equivalent clearance. Documentation will be required to confirm such clearances, including date of clearance issuance, the Cage Code, a DSS/DISCO point of contact, and the address of the cognizant security office. 
3. All personnel will be working on the Government site and shall complete a Contractor Personnel Access Application form (SSF 3237), and must undergo a security background check by the USSS. The contractor shall provide personnel who can successfully pass the background investigation. 
4. Prior to award, the successful awardee shall be required to provide the name and contact information for the Contract Security Representative (CSR) of their firm. The CSR shall be the contact between the contractor and the USSS. The CSR shall handle all forms necessary to obtain security clearances and access approvals. 

Since Contractor personnel shall be required to have a *Top* Secret level clearance, the offeror must submit the following documents and others as required for each respective person immediately prior to award:
 
a. Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
b. SSF 3237 - Contractor Personnel Access Application (see Attachment 1)
c. SSF 4024 - Conditional Access to Sensitive But Unclassified Information Nondisclosure Agreement (see Attachment 2) 
d. Provide evidence of the required security clearance for proposed personnel before beginning work. 
 
Question:  We have an interpreter in particular that fulfills all the requirements asked for on the RFP with the exception of her RID certification. She is currently waiting to present the practical side of the exam. Will this prevent her from being eligible for even being considered? According to the RFP, "Contractors must submit their resumes and a copy of RID certification with their proposal. Failure to submit these items will deem the contractor non-responsive and have the proposal rejected."

Answer:  If the interpreter is one of a pool of interpreters intending to be used by the vendor, their eligibility would be contingent upon completion of the RID certification. If the interpreter failed to obtain the certification, they would not be allowed to remain part of the interpreting team.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment 3 is to answer questions and extend the deadline. The deadline for proposals was Monday March 24 at 5 PM; the new deadline is Tuesday, April 1 at 12 noon. Questions and answers are below.
Q.	DD254 Secrete facility clearance - where to find application? Is there any assistance with this application?
A.	The DD 254 form is to be filled out after the presentation and is not to be included in the offeror's proposal package. USSS will email a blank form upon request, and will provide all necessary forms to the likely award winner after the presentation.

Q.	How to get Cage Code?
A.	The Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) is the only source for the assignment/maintenance of the Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Codes. See http://www.dlis.dla.mil/.
 
Q.	CSR needs application or registration - where to get this?
A.	The Contract Security Representative (CSR) is an individual designated by the offeror.

Q.	CSR if it need to get background check - where to go?
A.	The Contract Security Representative (CSR) is to handle the paperwork required for background checks. USSS will provide the necessary forms to the CSR. 

Q.	Annual or period of award: total estimated hours of services?
Q.	On-Call or Full time? Item " I " says full-time or Item " VI " says on-call? Or both?
A:	From the Statement of Work: The contractor will provide dedicated, on-call sign language interpreting services on Mondays through Fridays from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. for the deaf Counterfeit Specialist.  The contractor will be required to be on-site during these hours to provide interpreting services.  

Q.	SSF 3237 and 4024, Aplication where to get them? on your Bid it say Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 but there is no attachment or what so you mean for attachment 1 and 2? They seem like forms that need to be filed, where to obtain those.
Q.	Solicitation  137208's amendment states that "the offeror must submit the following documents and others as required for each respective person immediately prior to award" which means after the presentation, USSS will provide those forms to offerors.

(a)	This contract is eligible for the HQ, Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive-Level Agency Protest (ELAP) program, as an alternative to the usual provisions applicable for Agency protests under FAR 33.103.  An ELAP is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103.  The ELAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ACA, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum.  After an interested party files an ELAP protest on an ACA procurement to HQ, ACA and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the ACA ELAP protest, the ACA, ELAP protest will be dismissed.  A party wishing to file an agency protest may either file a normal agency protest where the resolution is made at the contracting officers level; or, in the alternative, file an ELAP protest, where resolution is made at HQ, ACA.
(b)	An interested party may file a written protest to the Agency under the Executive-Level Agency Protest program for contract solicitations arising and performed within the continental United States. Such Executive-Level Agency protests are limited to objections to any of the following:
(1)	A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.
(2)	The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.
(3)	An award or proposed award of the contract.
(4)	A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.(c)	Voluntary Automatic Stay.  This clause describes the circumstances under which the ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive Level Agency Protest (ELAP), as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4).(1)	In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest.  This is known as an automatic stay and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay).  However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden.  This is known as an automatic stay override.<BR><BR>ACRONYM (MEANING): FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation), DFARS (DoD FAR supplement), CLIN (Contract Line Item Number), SUB-CLIN or SLIN (Contract Subline Item Number), OSHA (Occupational Safety Health Act), FOB (Free-on-Board), PCO (Procuring Contracting Officer), CFR (Code of Federal Regulations), LSA (Labor Surplus Area), SF (Standard Form), DD/DOD (Department of Defense), NSP (Not Separately)Priced<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This notice is for information and planning purposes only. This is not a request for proposals and does not commit the government to award a contract; therefore, no solicitation is available at this time. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Coordinating Center for Environment Health and Injury Prevention (CCEHIP) began studying home and recreational injuries in the early 1970s and violence prevention in 1983. From these early activities grew a national program to reduce injury, disability, death, and costs associated with injuries outside the workplace. In June 1992, CDC established the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC). As the lead federal agency for injury prevention, NCIPC works closely with other federal agencies; national, state, and local organizations; state and local health departments; and research institutions in support of research about causes, risk factors, and preventive measures for injuries outside the workplace. Like diseases, injuries are preventable. CDC's Injury Center uses the same scientific methods to prevent injuries that have been used to prevent disease: carefully describing the problem through surveillance, studying factors that increase or decrease risk for injury, designing and evaluating intervention strategies that target these risk factors, and taking steps to ensure that proven strategies are implemented in communities nationwide. Currently, NCIPC has developed and launched a pilot training course for the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Public Health (PH) Curriculum: "Forging a More Powerful Relationship." This notice is for market research purposes to determine the availability of potential vendors that can provide six (6) one-day Emergency Medical Services and Public Health training sessions at sites within the continental United States. The primary focus of the training is in the area of injury prevention. The goal of the training is to strengthen collaborative partnerships between EMS and the Public Health community. The objectives of the proposed program are to enable senior and mid-level managers of EMS and the Public Health community at the regional, state and local levels to know the names, contact information, and responsibilities of key players in EMS and Public Health within their communities; to better understand the missions, roles and daily activities of EMS and Public Health, and their respective impact on the communities they serve. Describe ways in which EMS and Public Health services/agencies can support one another and work together to better accomplish both missions with special emphasis on injury prevention. Identify opportunities for enhanced collaboration and next steps for shared action. The core tasks and minimum contractor requirements shall include: 1)Fully schedule, make accomodations, administer and facilitate six (6) one day skill building training sessions for EMS and PH practitioners within the continental U.S. 2) Demonstrate knowledge and expertise in event planning and conference support. 3) Demonstrate knowledge and expertise in designing and implementing an evaluation protocol. 4) Demonstrate knowledge of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Public Health (PH) operational processes. 5) Demonstrate adequate qualified personnel to successfully perform the work activities by the required dates. 6) Demonstrate ability to record meeting minutes and synthesize proceedings to develop reports. 7) identify familiarity with CDC programmatic processes. 8) Provide public health experience in the field of injury control. All responsible sources are welcome to submit a written capability statement demonstrating their ability to perform the aforementioned technical requirements. CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMONSTRATE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED ABOVE. Capability statements shall also include: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, business size and status. Please limit your capability statement document to no more than ten (10) pages.&nbsp; The NAICS code for this requirement is 813920. Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statement via email to plw9@cdc.gov. The subject line of the email shall be "EMS abd PH Curriculum Training Capability Statement". Capability statements will not be accepted after June 16, 2008.&nbsp;</p>

The Hewlett Packard DL380G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580G4 SMART servers, along with these other components, have been identified as key components of the Departments SMART server infrastructure.IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified networks.   These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility.  These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel. In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time.As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing O&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed. Furthermore, these setups are matched to specific configuration needs in the DoS that recur on a regular basis making them virtually interchangeable and simplifying our spare part logistic needs.Finally, standardization preserves our ability to more easily expand with newer server models from the same manufacturer and achieve economies of scale, particularly in test and development environments, with lower overall cost. <BR><BR>Required Hewlett Packard DL380G5, Hewlett Packard DL580 G4, servers, and related infrastructure equipment (described above and in the attached) are required for SMART. These servers have been identified as key components of the Departments SMART server infrastructure which will provide Command and Control message handling, collaboration, Archive and Records Management functions for the Department of State.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The Hewlett Packard DL380G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.   This acquisition will be advertised on FedBid, a reverse auction site.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Title: Workforce Investment Act Gold-Standard Evaluation (WGSE)

The U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration (ETA) has awarded a contract for a rigorous, random assignment evaluation of the Adult, Dislocated Worker, and Youth formula programs established under title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) to Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., of Washington, DC, in the amount of $22,951,040.  The period of performance is eighty four (84) months from June 24, 2008, the date of contract execution by the government.  This contract was awarded by conducting an Unrestricted procurement.

The evaluation will examine these programs impacts on participants post-program employment and earnings and their cost effectiveness.  The evaluation will compare outcomes of WIA participants to the outcomes of similar individuals who do not receive WIA services.  The study sample will be tracked for at least four years from the point of random assignment.
