<DESC>Administer a project management information system (PMIS), including updates to existing projects, input of new projects, maintain historical project data, generate and distribute project information, analyze and explain performance measures, provide resource workload analysis, and provide user support on an ongoing basis.  This also includes facilitation of monthly project status update meetings, management of resource pool data, incorporation of actual time charged to activities from time and attendance records, update or modify report structures from system output, maintain and update the CFLHD PMIS Procedures Manual, regularly assess the system operation and implement process improvements that are desired by the users, and provide technical guidance and assistance to the users in operation of the system.  It is estimated that the work will require the full-time assistance of one System Administrator, one full time Assistant System Administrator, and one part -time Assistant System Administrator (32 hours).
  
Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD) has been using Primavera Project Management 5.0 software for the last 4 years for program management, multi-project resource and activity scheduling, earned value and workload analysis.  The use of Primavera as the project management information system (PMIS) is being evaluated under a separate effort and may be replaced during the life of the contract awarded as a result of this solicitation.  

This solicitation is for the skills and capabilities required to operate and maintain a Primavera Project Management system.  However, demonstrating the capability to recruit staff to maintain a core group of experienced and qualified resources that meet the needs of any PMIS is essential. 

The following tasks generally describe the work:  (1) Update the existing project schedule and resource database on a bi-weekly basis.  Although the capability exists for the system users to input project data directly, this procedure is not currently utilized.  Data for the updates will be retrieved from CFLHD?s 12 project managers and approximately 20 functional managers and sub-team leaders.  Communication with project management and technical leads to obtain the necessary information to create and maintain accurate and complete project schedules is critical.  (2) Maintain, update, and utilize approximately five standard templates for creation of new projects.  Assign either generic or specific resources as new projects are identified.  Establish initial schedules, check and verify logical sequence of activities, and modify as necessary to meet the project objectives using information and feedback from the project manager and functional team members. Use historical data to analyze schedule and resource loads to identify deficiencies.  (3) Establish and maintain a time-phased project budget that is integrated with a resource loaded schedule. Validate the resultant project budget and schedule to reflect accurate project advancement.  (4) Formally develop, maintain, and change baseline schedules and resource plans on current and out-year scoped CFLHD projects.  Ensure that dissemination of information occurs as changes are made to new or current baselines.  Attend and participate in project baseline meetings.  (5) Develop, maintain, and update performance measurements that are tracked using the PMIS database. Generate performance indicators on a monthly basis.  Provide the system modifications and support to perform earned value analysis (EVA) and reporting.  (6) As required, provide periodic revisions to the standard template activity descriptions to reflect changes made to activity names, activity tasks, predecessors, and successors.  Redefine current milestone activity work steps as necessary. (7) Maintain a readily retrievable historical database of completed projects.  Support the collection of historical costs from project related Architect/Engineering (A/E) contracts.  (8) Provide the Time and Attendance (T&A) coordinators with correct resource information for incorporation into FoxPro and Castle payroll systems.  Ensure that all appropriate activities and resources are identified in support of this function.  Establish protocols for charging to accounts for consistency on reports. (9) Identify activities and schedule or resource issues to discuss at monthly project status meetings. (10) Update or modify the output report structures that summarize and present project information, multi-project data summaries, and historic data for analysis of individual projects, groups of projects, and the entire project delivery program.  Create schedule, budget and project accomplishment datasets for automatic data extraction for use in the Federal Lands Highway Annual Report.  (11) Provide support to CFLHD?s Information Technology (IT) and Project Control Team personnel in the development of information sharing websites.  Modify fields in the PMIS system necessary to provide information fields for populating these websites.  (12) Provide one-time reports, trouble-shooting, and other support to the CFLHD Project Controls Team.  (13)  Maintain and update the CFLHD PMIS (currently Primavera 5.0) Procedures Manual as new system procedures are developed or existing procedures are modified.  (14) Continuously assess the system operation and identify process improvements that would be of value to CFLHD.  (15) Provide technical guidance, informal training, and general assistance to CFLHD Project Delivery staff in the operation of the PMIS.

All interested parties are invited to attend day one when the Government team will present a TSAT program overview and objectives, the draft acquisition strategy, system and segment requirements, and the SE&I contractor?s required interaction with the other program segments, including Space, TMOS, and terminals.    Day two will be used to meet individually with potential prime contractors who request a one-on-one session with the Government.  One-on-one sessions will be made by appointment and last no more than 1 hour. The Government will only provide information during these sessions that is equally available to all interested parties.  Following Day 2, the collective answers provided during the one-on-one sessions will be posted on the TSAT SE&I Bidders Library website.

<DESC>DISA/DITCO, intends to issue a brand name contract to Biztech Solutions, 20 Gibson Place Suite 310, Freehold, NJ 07728-8483. This acquisition is for A six month follow-on contract of Keyfile Software Support (400 Users, Version Control and Optical) at Defense Commissary Agency-PMO, Hopewell,VA. Period of performance is 01 October 2007 through 31 March 2008. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304( c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (brand name). Companies who can provide the above listed software support must request a copy of the Solicitation not later than COB 5 November 2007 to the following address: maria.meyer@disa.mil. The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price purchase order. All responsible sources may submit a quote that will be considered. The NAICS code is 541511 for this procurement. The following is the justification for the procurement: This requirement is for the continuity of Keyfile Software Support for sustainment of the legacy system, DDMS and to support DeCA's 400 users both CONUS and OCONUS location for 6 months pending the delivery of DERMAS. Only one responsible source has the requisite compatible service/maintenance arrangements to meet DECA's requirement. The start up time of another vendor to provide the software support is approximately 3 months, which would result in a duplication of cost. Therefore, it is not cost effective for the government to procure a new vendor startup.

<ARCHDATE>11292007
<CONTACT>Joy Smith, Contracting Officer, Phone 540-653-5001, Email joy.smith@mda.mil
<DESC>This synopsis is an update to the presolicitation notice issued by the Naval Sea Systems Command under solicitation number N0002407R6016 on March 15, 2007.  This effort is a part of the AEGIS Ballistic Missile Defense (AB) Program and requires continued development, test and production efforts necessary to support test and production schedules of the SM-3 Block IA, Block IB, and Block IIA Cooperative Development (SCD) missile configurations.  In addition to the previously synopsized effort for continued systems engineering support, the Missile Defense Agency intends to award a sole source effort to Raytheon Missile Systems of Tucson, Arizona, for the Unitary Kill Vehicle (UKV) and Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV) development for the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Program.  The purpose is to develop the UKV and MKV payload systems and integrate the payloads with the SM-3 Block IIA missile in the Ballistic Missile Defense Architecture and develop, within the context of a dual source (Lockheed Martin being the other source) risk reduction effort, concepts for adapting the SM-3 payload design to larger booster candidates such as the Orbital Boost Vehicle and the Kinetic Energy Interceptor booster.  This is a collaborative effort between the MKV, KEI, GMD and AB Program elements to ensure the UKV and MKV payloads are developed to a common architecture with common components where applicable.  The contractor will continue to provide the necessary engineering services and material for systems engineering, design and development support, fabrication, test equipment support, ground and flight test support, documentation support and assistance in the transition to production for the SM-3 program.  Additionally, within the dual source construct, Raytheon may provide like services and materials to the Missile Defense Agency in support of the GMD and KEI program elements. Raytheon Missiles Systems has been the All Up Round Design Agent for all Standard Missile variants since 1966.  This contractor is a highly specialized source and only a limited number of other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.  As a result of Raytheon Missile Systems involvement in the Aegis BMD Program, it is the only other source that currently possesses the in-depth technical knowledge of the system requirements to satisfactorily perform the work contemplated herein.  No other source, other than Lockheed Martin, has access to the proprietary data, resident expertise, and resources to perform the work described herein, nor will any other supplier or service satisfy MDA requirements.  This expertise cannot be attained by any other contractor within the anticipated period of performance without incurring substantial costs.  The estimated value of this entire effort is $1.4B dollars and the anticipated period of performance is for 5 years after contract award.  The proposed contract action is for system engineering expertise for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one of a limited number of sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented FAR 6.302. The Missile Defense Agency reserves the right to award multiple contracts under this synopsis if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contract Raytheon Missile Systems directly.

<DESC>The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the provision of water treatment facilities.

NAMSA is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. NAMSA intends to use the one step ICB procedure. No partial bidding is allowed.

The estimated value of this project is Euro 2.6 million ($3.7 million). The reference for the Invitation for Bid (IFB) is 5HQ27008-10. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-NAMSA-5HQ27008-10. 

The information to be provided to the bidders will be up to NATO UNCLASSIFIED. 

SCOPE OF PROJECT

This project is part of Capability Package (CP) 5A0156 - NATO Deployable HQ Assets for Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF). 

The original CJTF CP for 2000 and 1500 man-camps has been revised. The new package, tailored to suit the Deployable Communication Information System (DCIS) Baseline Capability, now consists of a 1 x 1000 man-camp consisting of a HQ and Support module tailored for the CJTF land based requirement and 2 x 500 man living accommodation modules, plus a 1 x 1000 man camp consisting of a HQ and Support module tailored for the CJFACC requirement and 2 x 500 man living accommodation modules, and 2 x remote CIS sites with living accommodation for 15 personnel each.

The contractor shall furnish to NAMSA water treatment facilities in accordance with the requirements in this Statement of Work (SOW). These facilities are to be based on 6.058 meter x 2.438 meter x 2.438 meter limited height shipping containers that will feature reverse osmosis technology. They are intended to provide high quality fresh water to rapidly deployable headquarters for NATO military forces over a wide range of geographic environments and climatic conditions. Accordingly, the facilities will be expected to be capable of using a wide variety of fresh and salt water sources. Four complete treatment facilities will be required, each of which will operate independently.

Required Assets and Summary Description

Raw Water -The raw water will be provided from a variety of potential sources that include salt water pumped directly from the sea, from in shore lagoons with high salt content, or from alkaline inland lakes. Fresh water sources could include lakes and rivers with high turbidity and bacteria characteristics and well water with a high mineral content. Whatever the source, the water will be provided by others to a raw water tank provided by the contractor.

Treatment Quality - Treated water must meet the quality standards laid down for public water supply in a NATO country. Contractors must state the water quality standard they intend to achieve and provide a copy of that standard with their bid submission.

Treatment Capacity - The NATO military camps have been subdivided into 500 man living accommodation modules. Each water supply system will provide 150 liters of treated water per man per day, with the capacity to surge 25% for short periods. Therefore, 4 complete systems, each capable of producing 75,000 liters per day routinely, with periods at 95,000 liters per day, are required. These quantities must be met notwithstanding the source.

Storage Capacity - The contractor shall provide storage capacity to store 4 days supply or 300,000 liters at each of the 4 camps.
Distribution - The distribution system, supplied by others, will be charged by pumps from the treatment facility provided by the contractor. The distribution system will vary between 500 and 700 meters long with up to 27 consuming facilities, and will operate through a 75 mm main insulated line, provided by others. The distribution system will be charged for both domestic and fire purposes with the water treatment contractor providing both the distribution pumps and the manually activated fire booster pump.

Climatic and Geographical Conditions 

While the equipment will be operated under conditions specified in Allied Environmental Conditions and Test Publication (AECTP) 200(3) for the range of A1 to C1 Climatic Zones, the equipment will be operated from within tented shelters (provided by others).  The contractor must therefore provide systems that can operate between 5?C and 40?C but withstanding shipping and storage at temperatures between -33?C and +71?C. The contractor must demonstrate with objective evidence that his equipment can meet these conditions in his bid documentation.

Transportability   

All containers are subject to off road movement by the military Deployable Rapid Operations Platform System (DROPS) for container handling. It is important that the internal fittings, packaging, and dunnaging withstand such conditions, in particular the steep angle of loading and unloading.

Water treatment containers shall have overall (outside) dimensions of a 6058 mm ISO container but be limited in height to 2438 mm with a width also of 2438 mm. The gross weight shall not exceed 14,000 kg when ready for transport. Containers must meet all of the ISO 668 specification for classification, dimensions and marking. Details are provided at paragraph 5.1.3.

Any loose material shipped separately from the water treatment system containers will be transported in containers (supplied by others) that will meet the structural specifications normally associated with standard sea freight containers. 

Integrated Logistics Support

Life Cycle Parts Support - The contractor will supply a 30 days spare and critical parts package as part of this contract and will identify and provide analysis for subsequent spares.
Training - The contractor will provide the initial training a training cadre, some of whom will become the life cycle managers of the equipment. This cadre will subsequently provide training to plant operators as well as first and second level maintenance personnel.  

Power - Power will be provided from the camp distribution system at 400/230 V, 3 phase, 50 Hz, (4 wire plus earth i.e., L1, L2, L3, N, PE). Power can be supplied directly at that specification. The contractor?s panel will further distribute the power as required, both to the water treatment facilities and to the panel of the 10 m x 30 m sheltering tent. The local power distribution shall include an RCD or earth leakage device that the contractor must take into consideration when determining the type of equipment used. 

General Electrical Requirements - The contractor shall design and perform all electrical work in a workmanlike manner, and provide all the material to the quality level required to ensure compliance of the finished work with the applicable National Standards in force in a NATO country, conditional upon these Standards being compatible with IEC 60364 published by the International Electrotechnical Commission. These National Standards shall be used as the ruling factor in all technical decisions to be made during the execution of the work, and shall override all other considerations. The contractor must specify, and include a copy of, the National Standards that they intend to use as part of the proposal.

Maintenance Plans, Schedules and Estimates

Maintenance will be conducted at 3 levels:

- In the field during periods of operations by military operators and maintainers who have received the plant operations and maintenance course. These personnel will be qualified technicians but will not likely be experienced on this particular equipment. They will likely operate and maintain the equipment for 4-6 months before being replaced by other similarly qualified personnel. The provision of high quality, treated water must continue throughout the maintenance periods, with only short periods of dependency permitted on the storage system. Pressure, including standby fire pressure, must always remain on the distribution system.

- In SOC during periods of refurbishment by SOC personnel who have received the plant operations and maintenance course, are experienced on similar plants, and who become familiar with the equipment through repeated maintenance and refurbishment cycles.  SOC personnel may be assisted by outside contractors and, on occasion, by the contractor?s field representatives. The plants will not be operational during this period but readiness requirements would dictate that these periods be limited to a maximum of 30 days, including investigation, repair time and the time to return to storage.

- Outside of SOC at the facility of a specialist supplier, possibly including the contractor?s facilities. These periods of extensive maintenance and refurbishment are expected to be limited to 8 weeks of maintenance, plus packaging and travel time.  

Please note that the actual quantities to be specified in the IFB may vary slightly from those specified in this announcement.

The proposed construction is to renovate a portion of the 4th floor Nursing Home; this will be the 1st phase of a program to convert the unit to a Palliative Care Unit.  The primary intent is to convert existing patient rooms into family lounge/kitchen/dining room/activity room/commons areas, convert non-ADA rooms to ADA compliant patient rooms, provide support rooms, and provide a non-institutional atmosphere.  Design will involve upgrading HVAC, plumbing, telecom, cable, nurse call, telemetry, headwalls with medical gas, electrical power (both normal and emergency), lighting, data, etc.  Meetings with Nursing Home (GEC) and medical staff will be required.  The project will also require limited coordination of relocated functions displaced by construction activities in the same general location.  Exact determination will be during the programming meetings.  The estimated construction is between $1,000,000.00 - $2,000,000.00.  Consideration is limited to concerns located within a 200 mile radius of VAMC, Charleston, SC.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541310.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The contractor may support the development and application of scientific and analytical activities/serv ices to conduct research, scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; concept formulation; assessment of systems and subsystems and their integration requirements; developmen t, analysis and evaluation of concepts, technologies, systems and subsystems; and development of operational concepts and tactics with the end goal being the application of results to enhance current or develop new war fighting capabilities, which may incl ude tools and systems for training and decision support systems. The contractor will leverage experience with existing national Centers of Excellence (Advanced Distributed Learning Technology Center, National Applied Software Engineering Center (NASEC), System of Systems Engineering Center of Excellence (SoSECE) , and N avy Metalworking Center) in providing research and development support, including operating state-of-the-art demonstration facilities and test beds for research and development. Pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii), USASMDC intends to award a sole source contract to Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC), 100 CTC DR, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935, because the RIPPLE, E-CTC, and A DL programs were developed by and are proprietary to CTC. USASMDC believes that CTC is the only source which is capable of performing this effort in a timely and cost effective manner. This effort will build on the proprietary products of CTC, and USASMDC believes that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of effort, cause program delay, and add additional costs to the government which would not be recovered through competition. This effort is anticipated to be awarded in Fisca l Year 2008 and shall not exceed 5 years in length and not exceed a total value of $45 million. This effort requires a Top Secret SCI clearance and will require the contractor to be certified as compliant with ISO 9001 / 14001 standards.

The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in  this requirement has not been determined.

The government will not reimburse participants for any  expenses associated with their participation in this survey. INSTRUCTIONS: 1.

The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System  Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based  training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global  positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar  Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position  with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and  instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator  for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar  capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to  three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part  of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval  Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training  System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified  aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010  with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability  (FOC) in 2011.

VI. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.     CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Openness of Solution and Technology Evaluation  - including plans for participation with the evaluation and integration team, (3) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge.   Consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA , and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  
      
2.     REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  ARDA and the Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.     AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VIII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission. 

2.     ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:

  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

AFRL intends to team with one or more U.S. intelligence agencies, and may desire that offerors selected for award would perform in collaboration with those agencies.  Key Performers of prospective awardees whose activities would involve collaboration with the Intelligence Community must hold a current Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD) clearance and be approved for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  A sufficient number of non-key performers to enable the effective accomplishment of the proposed research effort must also hold a Top Secret DoD clearance with SCI access, or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  In addition, prospective awardees whose activities would be associated with the Intelligence Community must also possess a current DoD Top Secret Facility clearance and an approved SCI Facility (SCIF). Offerors desiring consideration for awards involving collaboration with the Intelligence Community shall identify key personnel and enabling support staff satisfying the above Top Secret DoD clearance and SCI access requirement; shall certify their DoD Top Secret Facility clearance; and, shall detail their organization's approach to maintaining separation of unclassified and classified activities, and controlling need-to-know.

It should be noted that CASE is not intended as a solely classified effort, and that there is a wide range of research that can be done at an unclassified level.  Offerors should make it clear in their white papers and proposals which aspects of their work, if any, will be at the classified level.  While it is possible to execute an entire research program on the unclassified level, having key personnel with Top Secret DoD clearance will enable the program to have greater access to the real needs of analysts, thereby increasing the chances of successful research.

3.     REPORTING: For proposals selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based reporting system known as JIFFY.     Prior to award the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

VIII.     AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below (Email submissions preferred):

    Daniel Daskiewich
    Telephone:  (315) 330-7731

I.     FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)/RI, in conjunction with the Intelligence Community's Disruptive Technology Office (DTO), is soliciting white papers for innovative, creative, and high-risk research to advance the state-of-the-art in technologies and methods for Proactive Intelligence (PAINT).

Background

The Intelligence Community has a central mission to help the nation avoid strategic national security surprise.  Strategic surprises may come in the form of deliberate actions by adversaries of the United States, or they may emerge as unanticipated consequences brought about by the convergence or emergence of innocuous technological, economic, demographic, political, or natural forces.  In each case, it falls to intelligence analysts to spot the indicators or informal signs of situations that may threaten the US in the ever-growing volume, variety and complexity of data; to organize the indicators and findings into a coherent picture; to support accurate predictions of future situations and their potential impacts; and to identify factors influencing the evolution of the situation.

Technologies are needed which facilitate integration of diverse data into a coherent picture for analysis of future developments, and for collaboration among individuals and agencies.  To address this need, the PAINT vision is for an integrated intelligence capability enabling policy-makers and operational users to better comprehend the present and to understand and more effectively shape the future.  Thus, PAINT provides integrated intelligence that anticipates developments of strategic concern and identifies opportunities as well as vulnerabilities.

The purpose of the BAA is to develop the methods and technologies that will demonstrate, implement, and evaluate the PAINT vision.

Program Goals

The program has four goals:
1)	To develop predictive models of current or emergent situations that may threaten the US.  These models should span the entire life-cycle of situations and should be inclusive of the environmental context.
2)	To identify factors and strategies that may influence the evolution of these threats.
3)	To develop methods for determining comprehensive indicators of these threats.
4)	To use real world data and key indicators as feedback to adjust the models, their predictions, and potential influence strategies in goals 1-3.

Technical Topic Areas for the PAINT Program

To fulfill these goals, PAINT solicits white papers for research in four Topic Areas and in the interrelationships among them:

1.	Models: The approach to model development will be assessed for creativity and innovation that allows: a) rapid implementation and modification (in days), b) a comprehensive ability to describe, explain, and support predictions of specified threatening situations, c) the integration of the models into a Virtual World/Dynamic Gaming Environment, and d) model validation.

2.	Dynamic Gaming and Strategies: The proposed capability for a virtual world/dynamic gaming environment will be assessed for how well it can: a) rapidly predict a range of plausible future events and/or historical antecedents, and b) address a specified problem through the use of current data and key indicators.

3.	Key Indicators: The credibility, efficiency, and focus of the proposed process for developing key indicators from low level data will be assessed for how well it: a) uses available data as well as steers collection of new data, and b) provides feedback for tuning models and simulations, and for evaluating predictions of real world events.

4.	Architecture and Integration: The architecture needs to a) integrate the components developed in 1-3 above, b) enable the flexible and low-cost addition of new components, and c) support validation of the integrated system.

Technical Overview

This BAA proposes an overall challenge problem:  How should the Government locate and discover terrorist networks; describe them in the context of the political, religious, social and economic networks that intersect with, influence, and are influenced by, the terrorist network; explain the structure and topology of the terrorist network; predict the formation, evolution, vulnerabilities, and dissolution of the network; and identify strategies to shape or influence the network through selective action?  

The expression integrated intelligence capability enabling the policy-maker and operational user to better comprehend and to more effectively shape the future incorporates several important ideas: (1) the development of models and simulations to describe, explain, and predict situations and to serve as modular building blocks for a dynamic game/virtual world platform; (2) a dynamic game/virtual world platform where collaborative integration of data and analyses occurs across individuals, activities and agencies; (3) the use of a virtual world to identify critical factors and vulnerabilities and to develop influence strategies that affect future developments; (4) the application of current data and key indicators to evaluate the coherence and validity of the integrated picture provided by the virtual world; and (5) the capability to use this virtual world to identify "missing elements" for guiding collection.  As additional detail and information are incorporated, the parameters of the virtual world and near-term predictions can be evaluated against new data to provide a rigorous, ongoing evaluation; to update the models; and to adjust the influence strategies.  The PAINT program is focused on technologies for the rapid development of the virtual world/gaming environment and for the rapid generation and evaluation of predictions relative to the available data.  A related program, Advanced Research in Interactive Visualization for Analysis (ARIVA), will be concentrating on the user interface front end by developing new technologies for multi-modal interfaces serving multiple domains of expertise.

The PAINT program intends to leverage emerging technologies to enable the rapid creation of predictive and analytic models and simulations.  These models and simulations provide modular building blocks for a dynamic game/virtual world where the evolution of a specific network(s) can be analyzed.  Then, critical factors and vulnerabilities in alternative futures of that network can be identified to enable development of viable shaping strategies by policy-makers and operators.  The knowledge of networks provides a set of constraints or boundaries within which gaming and simulation (a common environment) can be used to extend the known into the future.  This common environment is used to integrate data, to develop predictions, and to identify critical factors and vulnerabilities which can be tested against data.  Dynamic gaming, whether competitive or cooperative, serves to introduce human judgment to account for ambiguous or poorly understood factors and to evaluate the coherence of the virtual world.  The testing process serves to validate both the predictive models and the shaping strategies.  In summary, the dynamic game/virtual world provides the basis for making predictions about the future, for developing influence strategies to affect the future, and for driving data collection to evaluate the models, predictions, and strategies.

Important Technical Ideas

The Government encourages offerors to identify their own important technical issues beyond the following list.  However, white papers should consider the following: 

1)	Integration of modeling & simulation with the emerging science of network analysis applied to distributed human groups/activities,

2)	Architectures for rapid development of simulations and models that can explain, describe, and predict situations,

3)	Development of problem-focused collaborative virtual world/dynamic game environments that can incorporate component models and simulations as well as real world data to enable the rapid exploration of strategies,

4)	Manipulation of the virtual worlds in parallel to the real world to identify critical factors, vulnerabilities and shaping strategies,

5)	Use of data filtering, data analysis, and other technologies to identify problem-specific, comprehensive collections of key indicators,

6)	Controlled application of assessment techniques to validate the outputs of the models and games against historical antecedent and actual events,

7)	Metrics and methods that tune the virtual world (and component models and simulations) against problem-specific data and feedback from near-term predictions,

8)	Systems integration issues and/or architecture concepts.

Example Variations of the Challenge Problem

The following topics represent possible expansions of the above challenge problem.  Offerors may choose to use these or others problems to explain their approach.

1. Nuclear Non-proliferation.  Terrorist networks depend on the threat of destruction and the resources to carry out those threats.  The possession of nuclear and biochemical weapon capability by unstable countries, by countries hostile to the US or by countries that are sympathetic to terrorist causes are, of course, major threats.  The technology to develop a weapon is available easily but obtaining the supplies to develop them or buying the weapons is difficult.  The problem is complicated because the US may not know whether a country: has supplies, has the capability to produce weapons, or has the presence of terrorist insiders or links to terrorist networks.  A major challenge is to describe the network of activities characteristic of nuclear energy/weapon development.  We must describe these programs in the context of the local religious, social and political networks and the multi-national political and economic situation; explain the structure of the research infrastructure for nuclear energy development using multiple indicators that distinguish offensive programs from peaceful ones; predict the evolution from what may be legal activities to weapons production; and recommend how to steer activities in peaceful directions.  Networks of indicators must be identified and interrelated to represent different stages of offensive capabilities.  This result should enable rapid creation of strategies for shaping development to blunt nuclear proliferation.

PART 2 OF 2

2. Denied Area Ethnography.  The challenge problem speaks of a terrorist network coexisting within and across the socio-political, economic and religious contexts of various nations.  The coexistence is at times symbiotic and on occasion parasitic.  Understanding the nature of these relationships is rooted in knowing how an organization or a country functions and the principles that guide that functionality.  Denied area ethnography is the ability to use multiple sources (news media, references, web info, info in their language, academics who have studied the area, businesses that deal with the local area and speak the language) to probe countries or regions where the US has no presence and must extract information from foreign sources.  The information must allow us to build a data-based conceptual model of that culture in terms of where people look for security; what constitutes legitimacy; and who actually controls government and commerce.  In this context, developing models of the cultural networks, deriving key cultural indicators, and creating a virtual world or dynamic game of an organization or culture provides both a method of integration and a structure for evaluating the coherence of information.

3. Globalization: Economic Warfare/Cyber Warfare.  Terrorist networks demand our attention today because of the apparent ease with which they inflict damage around the world.  The change is not so much in the network but in the technology that allows a hostile group global access.  What happens when a terrorist network acquires the capability to disrupt the vast and intersecting communications networks that allow us to function in today's electronic age?  Anyone with the right access can see worldwide economic information on his computer screen.  Similarly, a terrorist network may exploit market prices, identity theft, and redirect worldwide delivery of goods and services all by changing critical electronic information.  Warfare need not employ traditional firepower, but could be waged through information denial and disruption.  Understanding both the problem and potential solution space involves developing a robust model of each of the networks involved ? human and communications, being able to represent them in simulation/virtual environments that we can manipulate and explore for effect, and having key indicators that we can depend on for alerts about problems and what to do about them.

4. Pandemic.  Just as a terrorist network intersects with the diverse networks that constitute a nation, the contagion network, a complex structure itself, intersects with the various response networks across diverse societies.  As we watch the spread of the avian flu and its occasional penetration into humans, we recognize the need to prepare a global response to a deadly disease ? if not the avian flu, then another type of pandemic.  The required physical contact to sustain an epidemic is now extended through global transportation networks as well as the local social and familial organizations.  To impede the contagion by interrupting those networks, we would have to aid and abet the delivery of goods and services through global transportation, local social and familial networks, and collaboration with existing medical response networks.  Resolution of the problem would benefit from a) models that describe, explain and predict the intersection of diverse networks, b) simulations and virtual environments that can mimic those networks and their behavior, c) understanding of indicators for use as probes about what is happening, and d) strategies for interrupting events in ways that can halt the pandemic with minimal loss of life.

5. Emergence of Coalitions of the Intolerant.  Groups of otherwise unrelated organizations are beginning to meet and network to discuss common threats to their agendas.  For example, the anti-Davos group was formed in response to the Globalization meetings in Davos, Switzerland.  The possibility exists that a variety of organizations may pool efforts with terrorists groups to further common interests in ways that expand the reach and finances available to these ad hoc coalitions.  This topic potentially adds important elements to the above variations of the challenge problem.

Program Phases and Schedule

The PAINT program will have four phases.  Offerors should address all four phases.  Offerors should provide data for Phase 1 and plan for Government furnished data in Phases 2 through 4 (the data sets and their formats to be determined).  The general trend across all phases is (1) increasing complexity of challenge problem, (2) data that tends increasingly towards near real-time, real-world data, (3) increasing speed of development and adaptability of dynamic simulation and gaming models, and (4) increasing complex user-model interactions.  The phases and their focus areas are as follows:

Phase 1 (18 months) ? Component Predictive Models Integrated into a Virtual World/Dynamic Gaming Collaborative Environment

Phase 2 (12 months) ? Prediction Using Specific Challenge Problem with Historical or Synthetic Data

Phase 3 (12 months) ? Prediction using Real World Data Instrumentation, Feedback and Fine tuning

Phase 4 (12 months) ? Grand Challenge Problem: Influence Strategies for Alternative Futures

Scope of White Papers

Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  White papers are not limited to the specific strategies and challenge problem/applications listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, white papers should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in minor evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on special-purpose systems or narrow applications.  Teaming arrangements, if any, must be clearly defined in the white papers.  Teaming, where appropriate, is strongly encouraged in all technology areas.

V.     APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.     CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Quality of Proposed Staff and Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, and (3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs.  Also, consideration will be given to the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.

2.     REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  DTO and the Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate have contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  

The Government may use the services of MITRE and the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) personnel in an advisory role for the technical evaluation of proposals.  The exclusive responsibility for evaluation remains with the Government.  Representatives of the foregoing firm(s) participating in the evaluation process will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals.  Any objection to the use of any or all of the personnel identified above must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI.    AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.     AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.

2.     ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award.  In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

AFRL intends to team with one or more US intelligence agencies, and may desire that offerors selected for award would perform in collaboration with those agencies.  Key Performers of prospective awardees whose activities would involve collaboration with the Intelligence Community must hold a current Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD) clearance and be approved for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  A sufficient number of non-key performers to enable the effective accomplishment of the proposed research effort must also hold a Top Secret DoD clearance with SCI access, or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  In addition, prospective awardees whose activities would be associated with the Intelligence Community must also possess a current DoD Top Secret Facility clearance and an approved SCI Facility (SCIF).  Offerors desiring consideration for awards involving collaboration with the Intelligence Community shall identify key personnel and enabling support staff satisfying the above Top Secret DoD clearance and SCI access requirement; shall certify their DoD Top Secret Facility clearance; and, shall detail their organization's approach to maintaining separation of unclassified and classified activities, and controlling need-to-know.

It should be noted that PAINT is not intended as a solely classified effort, and that there is a wide range of research that can be done at an unclassified level.  Offerors should make it clear in their white papers and proposals which aspects of their work, if any, will be at the classified level.  While it is possible to execute an entire research program on the unclassified level, having key personnel with Top Secret DoD clearance will enable the program to have greater access to the real needs of analysts, thereby increasing the chances of successful research.  For the Architecture and Integration, and Key Indicators categories Top Secret Clearances for key personnel are preferred.

3.     REPORTING: For proposals selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based reporting system known as JIFFY.  Prior to award the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

    Sensors as Robots represents the next evolutionary step in sensor development.  The program proposes an autonomous constellation of autonomous sensors utilizing advanced knowledge-based algorithms that leverage knowledge of the environment, targets and past experiences to provide performance gains of orders of magnitude in interference rejection, target detection, identification and tracking.  Unlike existing fielded monolithic systems, Sensors as Robots strives to produce sensors that augment existing capabilities by optimally utilizing all available resources in a pervasive and anticipatory manner.  It is also envisioned that this technology will facilitate sensing missions that humans are not capable of or available to conduct.  In addition, further goals extend to the development of concepts and technology for future weapons systems that eliminate the possibility of involuntarily placing the warfighter and supporting staff in harms way.

    Achieving such a lofty goal requires development of new technology and future roadmaps for that which cannot be developed in the initial phase of this program. Technology development must focus on the following five areas, in ascending order of importance; net-centric sensing for Net-Centric Warfare/layered sensing/distributed sensing, proportional engagement and predictive resource allocation. Due to the broad scope of this program, white papers should strive to minimize duplication of efforts within the Department of Defense.  Therefore, it is imperative that all parties submitting white papers be aware of existing and emerging capabilities. Those of relevance should be leveraged in submitted white papers to reduce development time of the final product. 

    The U.S. Air Force has set an ambitious goal to be able to anticipate, find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess ? anything, anytime, anywhere.  Achieving a multi-faceted goal of this nature requires a solution not limited by traditional approaches, since   conventional radar and other sensors are not sufficient.  The current norm advocates larger more powerful antennas, utilizing existing detection processing and power-aperture products.  Instead, what is needed, is a distributed network of heterogeneous sensors (RF, EO/IR and acoustic transducers) utilizing advanced signal processing techniques and system concepts.  Through this manner, we can achieve order of magnitude performance gains over existing and planned systems. 

    Waveform diversity is currently perceived to be the current state of the art in radar technology.  Recent research incorporates adaptivity into the transmitted waveform for multi-mission multi-mode simultaneous SAR and GMTI, integrated sensing and communication. Focus on the joint design of antenna and waveform systems by the Air Force for integrated sensing has led to distributed apertures being considered as a generalization of classically designed multi-static radar system concepts.  This abstraction resulted in fine angular resolution aspects of distributed apertures being investigated, with orthogonal waveforms and frequency diversity applied for the suppression of grating lobes.  Such systems are being proposed for precision engagement, as well as for ground moving target indication and identification applications.  At the same time, others are extending traditional multiple-input multiple-output techniques with frequency diversity for radar applications. And by exploiting spatial diversity in lieu of bandwidth, radio frequency tomography is demonstrating improved resolution using a variety of waveforms, including multi-band and ultra-narrow band signals.  A unified approach of waveform design combined with spatial diversity is also advancing the state-of-the-art.  No longer are the signals radiated from each element assumed to be identical within a phase shift, and this lead to new capabilities.  One of such is frequency diverse arrays, which have the potential to generate beam patterns that vary direction of focus with range.

    A new capability that is of particular interest is simultaneous multi-mission multi-mode operation.  Multi-mode radars have existed for many years, but these systems typically employ sequential or interleaved modes of operation, often changed on a mission to mission basis rather than a true simultaneous capability.  This can create problems when, for example, a ground moving target indication system is tracking a target which stops moving.  Unless other (imaging) sensors are within the region of interest, the target may be lost.  This traditional approach clearly does not lend itself to the ambitious goal to find, fix, and track ? anything, anytime, anywhere.  If we are going to adhere to this goal, then our distributed/layered sensors need to be able to go anywhere at anytime.  In addition, they must be able to function autonomously or as a seamlessly integrated system capable of conducting intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance to support military efforts against new threats.  Through Sensors as Robots technology, the Air Force will be able to automatically predict the optimum positioning of sensors (air, ground and space) at the right times to facilitate these needs.  Therefore, Sensors as Robots is seen as the next logical step in the development of Net Centric Sensors for Net Centric Warfare.  It is also considered to be essential for successful development of distributed and layered sensors that are complementary to the AF triad (AWACS, JSTARS and River Joints).  Such platform's onboard sensors stand to gain optimized flight profiles through unobtrusive network interaction.  Sensing modalities (especially waveforms), inter/intra-platform sharing of signals and data, communications and electronic warfare are in a position to reap the benefits of leveraging this technology's infrastructure.  These gains do not even take into account the flexibility provided from the logical extension of existing and future assets that will become available.  Additional applications and further musings may be found in the motivational discussion in reference [1].

    AFRL/SY seeks detailed concepts and plans for the realization of Sensors as Robots as a future technology foundational to next generation systems.  Experimental demonstration of all critical aspects of this technology, especially signal, image and data processing algorithms are essential.  Systems of systems level simulation analysis demonstrating performance metrics and improvements over existing approaches are also required.  Innovation is a trademark of AFRL; hence all submissions should strive to emphasize novel ideas to distinguish themselves.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, incorporating all previous modifications, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c). This republishing also includes the following changes: (a) updates ombudsman information and (b) updates AFRL office symbols.  No other changes have been made. 

Technical POC/ Program Manager, Mr. Fred Rahrig, (315) 330-3906, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4505, telephone: (315) 330-3906, email: Fred.Rahrig@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/RIKA, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.  

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and advanced development in Commercial Imagery Archive & Information Dissemination (CIAID).  Research and Development (R&D) efforts shall be directed to provide advancements in the Commercial Imagery (CI) based technology areas to support Air Force and DOD operational missions.  These areas include improved digital geospatial dissemination capabilities, permitting rapid dissemination of large data sets through electronic means; spectral technology, including the integration and fusion of spectral imagery and geospatial data in relationship to intelligence exploitation and support to military operations; and improved speed and accuracy methods for generating and performing digital geographic and geolocation mensuration.  This program will develop, employ and exploit technologies to provide advanced prototype capabilities for potential transitions to operational units.  It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies to provide continued spiral development over the seven year program.  Objective:  The application of CI resources has shown great potential to contribute to the defense information and intelligence mission in the areas of surveillance and reconnaissance, mission planning, target graphics and product generation.  This procurement will assist the government in the establishment of a CIAID R&D Facility, a center of excellence, for technical development of CI technologies, supporting prototype demonstrations of these technologies, and evaluation and selection of transitionable technologies to appropriate organizations and systems.  These organizations and systems are expected to include the 480th Intelligence Wing (480 IW), 36th Intelligence Squadron, Geospatial Product Library Sites, Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and others as applicable.  Technical Background: The Air Force and other DOD organizations have fostered the use of CI to augment various requirements to support operational missions for the past several years.  For the most part, the results have been widely accepted, and show great potential for providing many new revolutionary information production technologies.  Selected CI related processes have begun to filter into standard production operations, some of which are prototypes.  It is envisioned that this PRDA will provide the means to effectively enact accelerated research, development, test, and evaluation, and ultimately result in more rapid CI technology insertion.  Innovative CIAID Research and Development White Paper Solicitation: AFRL/RIE is soliciting White Papers that provide innovative CIAID research and development.  

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION FOR CIAID WHITE PAPERS. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit an unclassified original plus (3) copies of their White Papers for the CIAID PRDA to AFRL/RIEC, ATTN: Fred Rahrig, Ref. PRDA 03-07-IFKA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4505 no earlier than thirty (30) days after the publication of this PRDA. White Papers are limited to a total page count of ten (10) pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  A softcopy of the white paper in Microsoft Word must also be provided. The White Paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their White Papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  Multiple White Papers may be submitted in different areas of technology.  White Papers will be accepted until 30 Sept 2009.  It is recommended that White Papers be received early in each Fiscal Year, e.g., April, to maximize the possibility of award.  However, White Papers will be accepted at any time, but it is more likely that funding will be available during the early portion of each Fiscal Year.  The purpose of the White Paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA.  Those White Papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award.  White Papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions.  

Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  All responsible firms may submit proposals or White Papers, as appropriate, which shall be considered.  Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, an e-mail address, and a fax number with their submittal(s) and reference PRDA 03-07-IFKA.  

Awards:  Awards will normally range from 12 to 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $500,000 to $2,000,000 for advanced technology development and integration efforts, per award. Contractor teaming is encouraged.  The total value for all awards under this PRDA is not anticipated to exceed $17,000,000.  AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable solutions to meet the needs of this PRDA.  Deliverables will be advanced prototype software applications and integrated system solutions.  Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished using the following criteria: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to this effort, (3) innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, (4) offerors capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost and fee realism and reasonableness.  In addition, the Government will consider other factors such as, past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity to perform the described effort.  Experience with, and access to, CIAID migration systems will be considered when said migration systems are integral to the proposed work.  Criteria 1 through 4 above will also be used to determine whether White Papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government.  White paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other submittals/awards under this PRDA.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Government Furnished Information/Equipment (GFI/GFE): Required GFI/GFE shall be specified in the white papers for evaluation.  

No minimum facility clearance, safeguarding capability, or personnel clearances are necessary for a CIAID award.  However, these could be required based upon the offeror's proposed role and contribution.  As such, depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require facility clearance and safeguarding capability up to TOP SECRET; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for the appropriate access up to TOP SECRET SI/TK information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  

All foreign allied participate at the prime contractor level is excluded.

Technical questions during the white paper development phase of this acquisition should be e-mailed directly to the Program Manager, Fred Rahrig at: Fred.Rahrig@rl.af.mil. Questions of a contractual or administrative nature should be forwarded to the Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.  Questions will be answered on a non-attribution basis. Questions, clarifications, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the RIKA Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.

STATEMENT OF WORK

INVESTIGATION OF EFFECTIVE RECOVERY AND NAPPING STRATEGIES
FOR COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE DRIVERS PHASES 1 AND 2
(September 2007)


1.	INTRODUCTION

Transport Canada (TC) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) are the sponsors of this research under a collaborative research project agreement signed between them. Under terms of the agreement, Transport Canada's Transportation Development Centre (TDC) is responsible for the overall management, design and conduct of the research, all in accordance with its own normal practices and procedures.

The essence of the entire research to be undertaken under the above noted agreement is described from an overall perspective in APPENDIX 1 to ANNEX ??A??, Project Implementation Plan: Investigation of Effective Recovery and Napping Strategies for Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers (revision date of September, 2007).

This Work Statement is for undertaking only a part (Phases 1 and 2) of the overall four phases of research described therein.

2.	OBJECTIVES

Undertake Phases 1 and 2 of an overall research project described in general terms in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) of APPENDIX 1 to ANNEX ??A??:

Phase 1 (Napping research): Develop napping research protocols, undertake empirical research, and recommend potentially effective napping strategies for CMV drivers.

Phase 2: (Recovery research): Develop recovery research protocols, undertake empirical research, and recommend potentially effective recovery strategies for CMV drivers:


3.	SCOPE

The scope of the study shall include:

Phase 1 (Napping Research) will involve the development and recommendation of napping research protocols, and subsequent implementation through simulator and/or field studies. Research protocols shall examine proactive naps aimed at preventing fatigue (napping prior to a work period) and reactive naps aimed at reducing and managing fatigue during the work day (napping in response to perception of fatigue). This phase of research will conclude with the recommendation of potentially effective napping strategies appropriate to the motor carrier industry.

Phase 2 (Recovery Research) will involve the development and recommendation of recovery research protocols, and subsequent implementation through simulator and/or field studies. This research will investigate the recovery effects associated with consolidated and split sleep during daily duty cycles, and immediately after completion of a ?day driving week? and a ?night driving week?. This phase of research will conclude with the recommendation of potentially effective recovery strategies appropriate to the motor carrier industry.

The research protocols should include an equal number of motor carriers and drivers from both Canada and the U.S.

The results of Phases 1 and 2 will be presented in two technical reports, respectively, including work performed, results, conclusions and recommendations. However, the research and reports of each of the two phases must address the relationships between napping and principal sleep periods such that their relative and combined effects on driver fatigue can be better understood; and such that the results will be useful for purposes of schedule planning and dealing with schedule perturbations.


4.	DESCRIPTION OF WORK

The PIP of APPENDIX 1 to ANNEX ??A?? describes the four phases of the overall project including objectives, deliverables, background considerations, method of implementation, and estimated schedule and budget. The PIP reflects the vision of the principal stakeholders, and is to be used as a general guideline. Bidders are expected to use their creativity and expertise to develop comprehensive bids that will address the objectives of the work to be undertaken under each of Phases 1 and 2, within the context of achieving the objectives of the overall research. 

Bids should consider addressing napping and recovery strategies that would be the most beneficial to drivers and could be applied by the industry to better manage fatigue.

Phases 1 and 2 are to be performed concurrently to the greatest extent possible. Bidders must provide bids for performance of the work included in both of Phases 1 and 2. Each phase must be addressed separately, However, the research and reports of each of the two phases must address the relationships between napping and principal sleep periods such that their relative and combined effects on driver fatigue can be better understood; and such that the results will be useful for purposes of schedule planning and dealing with schedule perturbations.

In addition to the tasks required to execute the work described in the PIP of APPENDIX 1 to ANNEX ??A??, the contractor is required to perform the following additional tasks for each of the two phases.


4.1.	Work Plan

Produce a detailed overall work plan, activity schedule, cash flow projection, project management control, and documentation procedures within three weeks of effective contract commencement date. These are to be submitted to TDC for review and approval. The work plan is to include the dates for submission and review of milestone and final reports, as well as dates of steering committee review meetings described in Section 5.6.


4.2.	 Milestone Reports

Upon completion of each major activity or milestone of the project, each of which are to be presented in the bid and later refined in the work plan of Section 4.1, prepare and submit a milestone report prepared in accordance with Section 5.7.

4.3.	Final Report

	Upon completion of the work, prepare a final report describing the objectives, scope and methodology, all work performed, data gathered and its analysis, results, conclusions and recommendations. The final report shall be prepared and submitted to TDC for review and acceptance in accordance with section 7 ?Final Report and Delivery?.
	
	
5.	PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

5.1.	TDC Project Authority

TDC Project Authority will manage the project on behalf of TDC and other sponsors. The TDC Project Authority will also be responsible for the management and conduct of steering committee meetings to be held during the course of the project.   (See Contract, clause entitled ??Project Authority??)

5.2	PWGSC Contracting Authority

Contract administration will be provided by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), which will appoint a Science Procurement Officer. (See Contract, clause entitled ??Contracting Authority).

5.3	Contractor Project Control

The contractor shall control the project by a CPM, PERT, SPEC, PC-based Microsoft Project or equivalent responsibility assignment and scheduling method.

5.5	Coordination of Project Activities

Coordination of activities between the contractor and participating organizations, including at the field level, will be the responsibility of the designated representatives of the contractor and those of the participating organizations to the greatest extent possible. TDC will, however, be kept informed of developments and activities and will be advised of any action it may be required to take in order to expedite the work or to achieve the project objectives.

5.6	Steering Committee and Review Meetings

TDC will constitute a Project Steering Committee that will include, among others, project sponsors and principal stakeholders. Other organizations, including those providing specialized expertise, may be invited to join the committee or attend specific project meetings and site visits should project requirements warrant. The committee will review and comment on the progress of the work, provide advice and make decisions, as appropriate, concerning scientific, technical and managerial aspects of the work and its results, and serve as a forum for information exchange.

Project steering committee meetings will be convened by TDC. Each meeting of the committee shall include the tabling of an up-to-date progress report by the contractor that clearly presents the status of the project and results achieved. The contractor will submit the report and an agenda of items it wishes to have covered during the meeting to the Project Authority for distribution to committee members in advance of the meeting. Official meeting minutes will be prepared by the contractor to record decisions, action items, and other notable events resulting from the meetings. Meetings can be held either on-site or by electronic means ? as appropriate and at the discretion of the committee. Steering committee meetings are to be held at the planning stages of the work, at principal milestones, at the completion of each phase of a project and preparation for the next phase, and after submission of the draft final technical report. The dates at which steering committee meetings are to be held will be developed at the planning stage of the work and will be included in the project work plan of Section 4.1.

Steering committee documentation (working documents, progress reports, presentations, minutes of meeting, etc.) are to be prepared in the English language. Translation, if required, will be the responsibility of TDC. Any translation requirements and associated preparation schedule will be established during finalization of the project work plan of Section 4.1, which will be included therein. 

5.7	Milestone Reports

Upon completion of each major activity or milestone of the project (except for the final phase or activity), the contractor will prepare and submit a report that includes methodology, data, results, conclusions, recommendations, and proposed work plan for the subsequent phase, major activity or milestone. The report must be of a high standard and must provide sufficient detail to permit stakeholder assessment of the work already performed and any decisions on proposed future work. Although not required to be prepared in accordance with TDC?s Publication Standards and Guidelines for Contractors (TP 929) referred to in Section 7.2, the contractor can nonetheless refer to TP 929 as an example of a report standard.

The milestone report is to be prepared in the English language. Any translation requirements will be planned during finalization of the project work plan of Section 4.1. Translation will be the responsibility of TDC.

The contractor shall provide copies of the milestone report for each member of the Project Steering Committee referred to in Section 5.6, as well as any additional number of copies specified by the Project Authority. These quantities will be established at the initial planning stage of the project, and will be updated as required during the course of the project.

<CONTACT>Rose M. Rivas, (210) 221-4975
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions received on 25 Oct 07, from a College/University: 1. Will the Army pay tuition and fees for each enrolled student, since there may be a variable number of students enrolled each semester? Or, do you expect a total cost for the program, regardless of the number of students enrolled during any course offere d?  What are your policies regarding administrative or indirect (overhead) costs? 	Response:  Pricing for the program is the affiliated College or University's prerogative.  Pricing per student is an affiliation fee and there is no tuition (students will not be attending classes on site at the College/University), since the Government p rovides all classroom space/facilities, textbooks, instructors, etc.  Our intent is to be considered a satellite extension of the College/University.  Additionally, the price may be based on a cost per student such as for example, associated administrative  costs per student that accrue for the period of time that the contract is in effect.  Although the solicitation and any resulting contract has a period of performance that is set, once a student enters the program and is paid for by the Government, the co ntract remains in force until the student graduates or is removed. 	Administrative or indirect (overhead) costs would be incorporated into the overall price.   2. If their Advance Standing MSW requires 30+ semester hours of courses. The Regular MSW requires 50+ semester hours of courses. Did the U.S. Army want/require the larger number of credit hours listed in the solicitation for each professional education pro gram? 	Response:  Our intention is to affiliate with a CSWE approved MSW program.  Consequently, our program would consist of the same number of credit hours as the affiliating College/University's program.  For example, if the affiliating College/Universitys A dvanced Standing Program consisted of 31 semester hours, the U.S. Army MSW program advanced training concentration would consist of 31 hours.  However, if the affiliating College/University's Advanced Standing Program consisted of 36 hours, the U.S. Armys  Advanced Standing Program would consist of 36 hours, etc.  Therefore, the program in which the Army uses will be approved by the College/University. See para., 1.3, Program Curriculum. 3. Regarding field practicum - What role will the school have in placing and monitoring progress of the students? For example, currently, there is difficulty placing civilian students in military field education placements because of current military prior ities. Will mutually agreed to civilian field placements be acceptable? 	Response:  In regards to field practicum, the College/University would have oversight of the program to ensure that all CSWE criteria are met; however, the affiliating College/University would have no role in placing and/or monitoring students in their fi eld practicum sites. This is a U.S. Army program and they will place the students. See para., 4.3.10.   4. Do you intend that the current MSW course syllabi will be used for all or most of the MSW courses in each program? Or, is there Army/military-specific content that you expect? In the Advance Placement and Regular MSW programs, there are two concentratio ns: Work with Children and Families or Policy, Planning, and Administration. Will the students be able to choose or does the Army have a preference for one or the other concentration? 	Response:  It is our intent to use the affiliating College/University's curriculum and syllabi for courses taught within the U.S. Army's social work program to the extent possible.  Core curriculum would certainly be based upon the affiliating College/Uni versity's curriculum.  However, elective courses would be developed at the AMEDD Center and School, subject to the approval of the affiliating College/University.  The area of concentration (track) such as Working with Children and Families or clinical, would be determined in conjunction with the affiliating College/University.  However, it is the intent of the U.S. Army to train social workers capable of working in clinical settings.  See para., 1.3, Program Curriculum. 5. To what extent will regular, full time faculty members be used as course instructors versus active duty Army (or other instructors) that you will nominate for appointment as School faculty? 	Response:  Full time faculty members of the affiliating College/University are not expected to teach any classes within the U.S. Army program.  Our intent is to affiliate with the College/University.  Acceptance/approval of our faculty as adjunct professo rs would be up to the College/University.  Therefore, all courses are expected to be taught by AMEDD Center and School faculty who have been approved by the affiliating College/University.  See para., 4.3.6 and 4.3.6.1.

The national pilot testing will include, but not be limited to: programming of data collection tools, recruiting and training hospitals to participate in the pilot, develop sampling methodology(s) for the validity and reliability of the measures to be established, support hospitals as they perform chart abstraction as well as other data abstraction activities, and conduct site visits to the hospitals to ensure the reliability of the chart abstraction process.

3.  Maintenance of the existing and newly developed hospital outpatient department measures.  Maintenance includes: maintaining a technical expert panel and specifications, maintain an environmental scan of evidence-based practice, and other relevant guidelines, work closely with the CMS/The Joint Commission Technical Measures Workgroup to present prioritized measure updates on a regular schedule, maintain the CMS/The Joint Commission Technical Measures Manual and Data Dictionary for those common measures/data elements included in the selected measure focus areas, work to assure that issues related to the measures are resolved in a timely fashion, and conduct ad-hoc and on-demand analyses of the efficacy of the measures.

Interested sources having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements that demonstrate their experience, knowledge, and the ability to provide the following:  
1. Ability and experience of pilot testing quality measures; 
2.  Experience with and knowledge of the measure development process to include environmental scanning, literature searches, building a technical expert panel, keeping current with changes to national guidelines and the development of algorithms to be used by programmers to program the data collection tool;

Capability Statements shall be limited to 15 pages or less and shall include any/all teaming arrangements.  All teaming arrangements shall also include the above-cited information and certifications for each entity on the proposed team.  Teaming arrangements are encouraged.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking interested and qualified potential offerors to conduct structural repairs, maintenance, and flight testing of the DCCAT Widebody Airborne Sensor Platform (WASP) DC-10-10 airframe.  MDA will evaluate submissions for technical approach, qualifications and capability, realism of anticipated cost and schedule.  This announcement is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  There is no solicitation available at this time.  This notice is published for information purposes only and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract nor otherwise pay for information/items provided in response to this RFI.

Background:	MDA developed and operated the Widebody Airborne Sensor Platform (WASP) as a test asset supporting missile defense flight tests by performing optical data collection and hosting guest sensors in a captive carry configuration.  The WASP is a DC-10 aircraft modified for open air sensor viewing, and includes a primary sensor system (PSS) for radiometrically calibrated data collection.  The PSS is similar to MDA's High Altitude Observatory - II (HALO-II) sensor.  The WASP was removed from service due to airworthiness issues.  MDA is seeking industry candidates to return the WASP to service.   A Sources Sought notice for the WASP restoration effort was previously published on May 10, 2006 by L-3 Communications/Integrated Systems in conjunction with the Missile Defense Agency (http://www.fbo.gov/servlet/Solicitation/R/USAF/AFMC/041302/Reference-Number-ABS-WASP-06).  Also, the Government issued a notice of intent for the issuance of a sole source contract to Raytheon Technical Services Company for a WASP return to service analysis on December 22, 2006 (http://www.fbo.gov/servlet/Solicitation/R/ODA/MDA/WASHDC1/Reference-Number-HQ0006-07-C-WASP).


Technical Requirements:  
The primary objective is the analysis, repair, modification, maintenance, and verification required to permit full flight envelope operations of the WASP DC-10 and its sensor systems.  Incidental to the primary repair effort, the contractor will concurrently perform an aircraft heavy maintenance C-check, and address all relevant airworthiness directives as part of this effort.  The customer's schedule expectation for returning the WASP DC-10 aircraft to service is no longer than 9 months. 

All structural analysis and modifications shall meet or exceed the WASP Structural Assessment document criteria.   In addition, the effects of aerodynamic jitter, cavity resonance, and aft fuselage/empennage disturbances must be complied with in the technical approach.

The following technical data will be provided on the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FEDTEDS) website (http://www.fedteds.gov) for interested parties: 
1.	WASP Structural Assessment Document
2.	WASP Finite Element Model and verification report
3.	WASP/DCCAT Design documents

<SUBJECT>B -- SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR ACQUISITION OF AN ANNULAR LINEAR INDUCTION PUMP (ALIP)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-PROC039
<RESPDATE>112107
<ARCHDATE>12062007
<CONTACT>Dawn Karns, Administrative Specialist, Phone 208-526-9554, Fax null, Email Dawn.Karns@inl.gov - Steve Paschke, Business Specialist, Phone 208-526-1113, Fax 208-526-0876, Email stephen.paschke@inl.gov
<DESC>The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) seeks qualified businesses, small businesses, and joint venture teams that are capable of manufacturing an Annular Linear Induction Pump (ALIP) for test demonstration purposes of pumping liquid NaK in a test loop to be built at the INL. 

During the next four years the DOE Idaho National Laboratory is planning on conducting performance evaluation tests using a liquid metal test loop. An ALIP pump is needed to provide the pumping power for the loop and so requires contractor support for the fabrication of the ALIP pump. The INL is seeking information from commercial companies who have experience in manufacturing electro magnetic pumps for application in high radiation field environments.

Liquid metal (or alkali-metal) pumps are being considered for use in the primary reactor cooling loop and secondary power conversion cooling loop of a small nuclear reactor. Desirable Liquid Metal Pump (LMP) characteristics include low mass, high efficiency, and long life. The proposed system operating lifetimes is 8 years. The liquid metal pump is a critical element of the primary heat transport system for any liquid metal cooled reactor. Heat removal from the core and delivery of thermal energy to the power conversion subsystem depends on proper operation of the pump. 

Reliability and durability of the pump are the two prime factors deemed essential to such a power system. The operating characteristics of the pump during both steady state and transient conditions will impact the conduct of operations of the overall system. The final design of the pump or pumps for a specific mission will require some iteration in the design process that involves the core and power conversion thermal hydraulic parameters, as well as the pump properties. However, the mass flow rates and pressure parameters currently identified fall within existing design space of the ALIPs that have been developed and operated. So the design planned to be used for this procurement is based on a system that has previous operational experience.

The Idaho National Laboratory will provide the ALIP design specifications and drawings needed to fabricate the pump.  The design drawings and specifications will be provided at the time of the announcement asking for competitive bids for 
the fabrication of the pump.

The proposed schedule of activities is as follows:

A Request for Proposals will be issued in December 2007.  ALIP design specifications and drawings will be provided at that time.  Proposals will be received by the end of January 2008.  Selection and award of the contract is anticipated to be in March 2008.

This notice is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. DOE/INL will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this Notice. No solicitation exists at this time. Please be advised that all information submitted will be considered procurement sensitive. A draft performance work statement is attached.

<SUBJECT>J -- Maintenance Agreement
<DESC>The Bureau of ATF intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Pitney Bowes, Annandale, VA to procure maintenance agreement for one year of ATF owned mailing systems.   Pitney Bowes has developed proprietary mailing systems, such as DM infinity, B700 series, DM 300 series, and DM 500 series, and 1000 which ATF owns and no other company can service their mailing systems.  By having this equipment under Pitney maintenance agreement ATF will have the assurance of always having operable equipment, at any given time and/or in emergency situations.  Pitney Bowes is the only company capable of servicing the Bureau's mailing equipment.  Bureau has 227 locations with ATF owned equipment.  Failure to have maintenance agreement would be detrimental to the Bureau?s mission due to the fact that ATF will not be able to repair broken equipment and will not be able to mail mission related items.  This would also result in serious financial burdens by requiring the purchase of new mailing equipment.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received from interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. There is no solicitation available for this requirement. This requirement will be awarded through the Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR Part 13. The closing date for this requirement is November 1 , 2007, 1:00pm EST.

<SUBJECT>99 -- SBA proposes to increase size standards for Heating Oil Dealers and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Bottled Gas) Dealers industries.
<DESC>The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has proposed to change the small business size standard for the Heating Oil Dealers industry (North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 454311)) from $11.5 million in average annual receipts to 50 employees, and the size standard for the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Bottled Gas) Dealers industry (NAICS code 454312) from $6.5 million in average annual receipts to 50 employees.  Large and fluctuating increases in the prices of heating oil and propane over the past several years indicate that a more stable measure of firm size based on number of employees rather than receipts is needed for these two industries. 

SBA must receive comments to the proposed rule on or before November 30, 2007. 

To submit comments, please go to <a href="http://www.sba.gov/cgi-bin/byebye.pl?TO=http://www.regulations.gov">regulations.gov</a> and use "3245- AF67" (no quotes) as your search term to locate the proposed rule.

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

(End of Provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a  Coast  Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP Program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for the urgent and compelling  reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.
Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103 (d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period  specified. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below.
