<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Afghanistan Procurement Support Office in Bangkok, Thailand, and in conjunction with the USAID Mission in Kabul, Afghanistan intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for USAID/Afghanistan to solicit proposals from qualified organizations/institutions interested in implementing the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Development Activity.     Critical to the success of this program is maintaining a focus on enabling, rather than directing, the growth of the private sector.
 
The primary goal of this program is to increase the contribution of the private sector to economic growth in a minimum of four provinces including: Badakhshan, Nangarhar, Helmand and Heart, with the following objectives:  

1. Expand markets, increase access to information, and lower transaction costs.
2. Develop the workforce through technical, trade, accounting, and managerial training.
3. Create jobs through growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.
4. Promote domestic and foreign investment.
5. Compete internationally where Afghanistan has, or potentially has, a comparative advantage.
6. Develop Afghan domestic markets and improve productivity to help local products become competitive with imports.

This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this solicitation is 935. As such, this procurement is open to all offers from USAID Geographic Code (Source, Origin and Nationality) 935 which include all countries, except for those designated by the US Government as foreign policy restricted countries. The current foreign policy restricted countries are as follows: Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria.

USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in this activity as the prime contractor or as subcontractor in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR. USAID also encourages the use of the Interested Vendor List (IVL) on the Federal Business Opportunities website page so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation.

USAID anticipates awarding a single award Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract.  The period of performance will be 3 years with two one year options. The RFP is expected to be issued on March 14, 2006 and proposals will be due no later than the closing date specified in the RFP.  Any amendments to this solicitation will be issued on the website along with the RFP. Please check the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) periodically.

Any questions should be submitted via email to the point of contact at: apsobangkok@usaid.gov.

Please do not contact USAID/Afghanistan in Kabul directly, since all communication must be through this office.  The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.
