However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>This notice is related to a Sources Sought Notices, NIH-NICHD-2019-09, released on February 1, 2019. This acquisition is a full and open competition. This notice is issued on behalf of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Office of Acquisitions, NIH, DHHS. This is a Presolicitation Notice in advance of the Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.
<p>The RFP NIH-NICHD-2019-09, detailing the specifics of the project, as well as information pertinent to the development of an Offeror's proposal, will be available electronically within approximately 15 calendar days of this notice and may be accessed through the internet on the Federal Business Opportunities website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. No paper solicitation is available. Potential Offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and for routinely checking the site for any solicitation amendments issued by the Government. Proposals will be due on or about June 21, 2019. It is anticipated that a single cost-reimbursement contract award will be made for a 12-month base contract with four (4) option periods beginning on or about September 16, 2019.</p>
<p>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) contract requirement entitled, "Preclinical Medications Screening in Alcohol Preferring Rats". This is NOT a NIH grant opportunity.</p>
<p>The NIAAA seeks a contractor to address the present and anticipated future needs of NIAAA's Medications Development Program for the blind efficacy testing of reference compounds, compounds of interest and proprietary compounds supplied to NIAAA from industry suppliers on voluntary alcohol drinking by alcohol preferring P and HAD1 rats. The Division of Neuroscience and Behavior's (DNB) Preclinical Medication Efficacy Testing Program seeks to support this effort and to implement the testing capacity of up to five (5) compounds per year over the next five (5) years using mechanisms having intellectual property conditions favorable to compound providers when acquiring compounds from industry. This will eliminate a major barrier to testing optimized compounds and will stimulate interest by the pharmaceutical industry in developing high quality, marketable compounds for alcoholism. The data generated will be used in the identification of compounds for further development.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the effort to be supported will require an estimated 7,904 hours of effort in the base year and 31,616 for four (4) option periods. All qualified organizations are encouraged to respond with a contract proposal.<br /><br /><br />Primary Point of Contact:<br />Patricia N.

<CONTACT>Kesha L. Williams, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014026594, Email williamskl@mail.nih.gov - Alice Pagan-Pereira, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-6959, Email pagana@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&amp;D) PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE, ITS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP).
<p>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) plans to compete and award a contract for the development of the NIH Infant and Toddler Toolbox. This will be a full and open competition resulting in an Indefinite/Delivery, Indefinite/Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contract. The RFP will be issued VIA FEDBIZOPPS on or about May 06, 2019.</p>
<p>The Child Development and Behavior Branch (CDBB) within NICHD seeks to develop and support research relevant to the psychological, cognitive, neurobiological, language, behavioral and educational development and health of infants, children, adolescents and young adults. Among the CDBB published research priorities is the development of an efficient, comprehensive neurodevelopmental battery of measures from evidence-based neurocognitive research specific to typically developing infants and toddlers.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of early developmental assessment or screening instruments. Standardized, reliable assessment instruments allow for direct evaluation of infant and child behaviors, but they are time intensive, expensive, require trained personnel for administration, scoring, and interpreting, and often rely on outdated norms.</p>
<p>Consequently, there is a great need across many biomedical and biobehavioral disciplines for a standard measure of infant and toddler neurodevelopment that is efficient to administer, low in cost, useful in both clinic and research (especially in resource poor settings) and yet captures multiple domains of neurodevelopment. For this reason, it is proposed that the NICHD develop such an assessment tool with a focus on assessment of neurodevelopment from infancy through 3 years, 6 months.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to develop and nationally norm the NIH Infant and Toddler Toolbox for research and clinical use in children between 1- to 42-months of age that will include both direct child assessment as well as parent/ legal guardian report, although direct assessment is preferred whenever possible. It must be designed from existing validated tasks and protocols that have been used and accepted in cognitive development research and cognitive, social, and behavioral neuroscience fields. It must be inexpensive to obtain, easy to administer within a relatively brief time frame, and able to capture multiple domains of neurodevelopment across the ages of 1 to 42-months.</p>
<p>English and Spanish versions should be developed and validated in culturally and geographically diverse groups. The assessment method should be dynamic, i.e. capable of being adapted over time in response to advances in science and or technology. Measures should be employed that are internally flexible, e.g. adaptive testing. The instruments must have sensitivity to developmental change over time. The project will encompass qualitative research focusing on the identification of content area and the development of domain specific tasks, significant data management and analyses. The project must also address the formal testing and refining of the final nationally normed toolbox of tests and the selected tablet device programmed to deliver all the toolbox testing and interpretive analyses.</p>
<p>The execution of the various tasks required to achieve this effort will likely include scientific expertise and capability in the areas of cognitive neuroscience, clinical psychology, epidemiology, developmental psychology, pediatrics, social neuroscience, information management systems, developmental perspectives, neurology, psychiatry, psychometrics, neuropsychology, clinical and rehabilitation medicine, statistics, health services and outcomes research, and database design and management, as well as mobile device/tablet programming, application design and user support for testing site users.</p>
<p>This RFP (NIH-NICHD-CDBB-19-15) will be available electronically on or about May 6, 2019 on FedBizOpps (FBO) website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The due date for submission of proposals in response to the RFP is anticipated to be on or about June 21, 2019. The reference number to be used for this announcement is: NIH-NICHD-CDBB-19-15. Information in the anticipated RFP supersedes any information in this pre-solicitation announcement. This is not an RFP and this announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract.</p>

<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Philadelphia plans to award a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) requirements contract in support of the Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS) Forward-looking Infrared (FLIR) on the MH-60R and MH-60S aircraft.

The resultant PBL contract will include one 5-year base period and one 2-year option period.
The contract will include PBL support of 15 NSNs which are listed in the attached document.  

Justification for Sole Source Acquisition is based upon the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Absent interest/approval of additional sources, the Government intends to solicit Raytheon Company.

NAVSUP WSS does not own rights to drawings. Drawings cannot be obtained, nor is it possible to draft adequate specifications for them to facilitate competition at this time.  

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition. Only the Raytheon Company will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for repair.
A Source Approval Request (SAR) brochure is available upon request. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.


Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

The submitted SF-330s will be evaluated on the following criteria:
This acquisition will be in accordance with FAR Part 36.602-1 and VAAR Part 836.601-1. The following evaluation criteria will be used to evaluate SF-330 technical proposals:

The A/E must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation criteria for all services. Evaluation Criteria (1) through (4) are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criteria (5) and (6) are of slightly less importance than (1) through (4), but are equal value among themselves; Criteria (7) and (8) are the least important and listed in descending order of importance. Specific evaluation criteria include:
1. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required,  including, 
where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.
 2.  Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.
 3.  Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.
 4.  Past Performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules.
5.  Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.
6.  Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality  of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.
7.  Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.
 8.  Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete  architectural and engineering services.
Criterion 1 - Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.

· Experience with multi-phased hospital design and construction programs, to include continuity of services during construction;
· Experience with construction and renovation phasing in hospitals, larger infrastructure projects and other VA facilities;
· Experience in providing post construction award services (shop drawing review, as-built drawing and Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) preparation, construction inspection services, and Operating and Maintenance Manuals).

Submission requirements: Provide up to five (5) projects completed or substantially completed within the past five (5) years that best illustrate specialized experience of the proposed team in the areas outlined above. Example projects shall note project s square footage. All projects provided in the SF-330 must be completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and/or perform work under this contract. To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF-330 Part 1, Section F Item 25  Firms from Section C Involved in this Project,  block (1). Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21. Include an e-mail address, and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c).

If the contractor served as a subcontractor on a project, indicate the value of the work they provided towards the performance of the overall project. If a project was performed by a joint venture, and not all joint venture partners are on the team proposed for this contract, the offeror/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract. Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE: If the Offeror is a joint venture, information should be submitted as a joint venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be submitted for either joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of five (5) projects for this criterion. Projects shall be submitted on the SF-330.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  Do not list an IDIQ contract as an example of a completed project. Instead, list relevant completed task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above. Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.
Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being rated lower.

All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in Part 1, Section F of the SF-330. The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in addition to Part 1, Section F in evaluating Criterion 1.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR<br />PROPOSAL. <br />The purpose of this announcement is to conduct market research to determine the availability and capability of businesses to provide fleet modernization consultation at Tyndall AFB, Florida. Information provided to the Government as a result of this posting is for planning purposes only, and is strictly voluntary and given with no expectation of compensation. Additionally, the submission of this information is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure any services, nor does the Government intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information. The information attained will be used to facilitate acquisition planning. Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Synopsis, the Government will determine whether a set-aside is in the Government's best interest.
<p>The NAICS Codes is 336411, Aircraft Manufacturing, with a size standard of 1500 employees. A response to this sources sought synopsis will not be considered an adequate response to any forthcoming solicitation. There is no solicitation available at this time. The tentative solicitation issue date is to be determined. Any future solicitation will be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov/). Interested Parties are solely responsible for monitoring the aforementioned website for the release of a solicitation package and/or any updates and/or amendments.</p>
<p>Contractor will conduct an in-depth analysis of the Civil Air Patrol's (CAP) core missions as stated in the 2016-2020 CAP Strategic Plan and associated aircraft fleet to make recommendations regarding CAP's suitability for current and future mission requirements.

The contractor is required to provide specific fleet and mission equipment modernization/refresh timing/upgrade recommendations, as well as recommendations for fleet composition (i.e. types, and if necessary, specific models of aircraft). Increased Department of Defense reliance upon CAP through CAP-USAF, has revealed an increasing mission demand for Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA), Homeland Defense (HD), and Homeland Security (HS) missions with a more immediate and greater need in times of crisis. CAP owns, maintains, and operates a fleet of 560 single engine aircraft. Based on CAP's current and future mission and services, CAP's fleet may need to be modernized, diversified, and/or upgraded. The contractor will facilitate a dialog with CAP staff and all stakeholders to understand the CAP fleet and missions to accomplish this objective.</p>

<DESC><p>1. Introduction<br />The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI), is seeking information on SAP Agile Deployed Operations (ADO) product support services for configuration and inclusion of the ADO application in the Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System. <br />This is a Request for Information (RFI), as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e).<br />This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or an invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an eventual acquisition approach. This RFI does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation. This RFI is being conducted solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals, nor any other kinds of offers, will be considered in response to this request or accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Offerors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with participating in this RFI. Information received in response to this RFI shall be safeguarded adequately from unauthorized disclosure. Acknowledgement of receipt of submitted items will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the outcome of the information received.<br />The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to inform the Army on the capability of skills and resources to design and configure SAP applications due to the need for significant tailoring to support the business process of GCSS-Army Soldiers in deployed and disconnected field of operations.</p>
<p>2. Background</p>
<p>Global Combat Support System - Army (GCSS-Army)<br />Built using a web-based SAP ERP solution, GCSS-Army provides functional services to the business enterprise and Warfighting mission areas focused on property book, supply operations, tactical maintenance, logistics management and associated tactical finance functionality and serves as the tactical financial system of record for the Army. Northrop-Grumman is the Lead System Integrator for the GCSS-Army ERP.</p>
<p>Building on the SAP-based ERP foundation, GCSS-Army Increment 2 will also provide the Army Enterprise Aviation capabilities to deliver greater efficiencies and improve information flow. Enterprise Aviation Sunsets the Army's current aviation logistics and maintenance information system, Unit Level Logistics System - Aviation (Enhanced) [ULLS-A(E)], by incorporating aviation maintenance, integrated aviation supply, logistics management, and airworthiness required data into the GCSS-Army system baseline.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) System Simulation, Software and Integration (S3I) is the Government Lead System Integrator for GCSS-Army Increment 2. <br />This RFI adds new requirement for independent contract action for SAP NS2 | National Security Services (NS2) provider to leverage the Aircraft Notebook (ACN) by reconfiguring to operate within the SAP ERP architecture in a disconnected mode made possible via SAP's Agile Deployed Operations (ADO) application. <br />Toward this aim, the Army in concert with SAP NS2 formed a Middleware Engineering Analysis Team to provide GCSS-Army with a qualitative and quantitative technical recommendation on the GCSS-Army Middleware solution. The approved path forward is procure SAPs ADO, configure for use in the ERP and redesign the ACN to work within the SAP end to end architecture. The Army therefore requires SAP NS2 configuration services to develop and field these capabilities to resolve the longstanding challenge of providing tactical logistics support in a disconnected operations mode.</p>
<p>3. Scope of Services</p>
<p>The scope of services is to acquire expertise and authority to create a Foundation Development (Build, design, configure] using the proprietary ADO application for the GCSS-Army ERP. While this foundation supports ground and air components, at its core, GCSS-Army INC2 further requires a functional and fielded solution for Aviation that also repurposes the ACN in this SAP architecture. Specifically, the offeror will provide support in the following areas:<br />a. Initial ADO project end-device setup<br />b. Other related technical SAP application components installation and setup<br />c. Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Enhancements, Forms (RICEF) ADO integration assistance and data-conversion programs<br />d. Customer Functional Testing Assistance</p>
<p>There are three main areas of the SAP ADO; Foundation, Aircraft Notebook User Interface, and ERP Central Component (ECC) Process. All three areas consist of Development (Build, design, configure) meeting the overall Disconnected Program objectives. SAP has completed the Sprint 0 design and requirements gathering, the output produced requirements which were categories into Epics and Backlog list. The three main areas are as follows:</p>
<p>a. Foundation: requires the installation of the SAP ADO Commercial Off-The-Shelf application within GCSS-Army environment and modify the existing configuration. Utilizing the Sprint 0 output, develop required functionality that meets the requirements and needs for the Foundation to run as the basic software architecture for disconnected functionality processing.</p>
<p>b. Aircraft Notebook User Interface: Consists of developing the final Soldier's usability of an Aircraft Notebook as it relates to maintenance and repair, and inventory management, and SAP ADO software application installed and configured on Army's laptops and connecting to the Foundation ADO platform.</p>
<p>c. ERP Central Component (ECC) Process: Connecting the ADO application, business and data process to GCSS- Army environment. Requires understanding of the ECC 6 customization and table changes to ensure the overall ADO processing run fully from ACN through Foundation to the ECC application.</p>
<p>Service providers will develop the capability in close coordination with the existing lead system integrators (LSIs) to understand the business process while capitalizing on existing subject matter expertise of the LSIs and test teams to ultimately facilitate the migration of the finished design into the GCSS-Army ERP system baseline.</p>
<p>The Army anticipates issuing a Request for Quote to acquire the SAP ADO Application "software." <br />The places of performance will be Fort Lee, Virginia and Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.</p>
<p><br />4. Information Requested<br />For this RFI, the Government seeks information regarding your ability to work in the multi-functional environment with Government, LSI and SAP NS2 with authority to affect changes to the proprietary ADO application needed to configure in GCSS-Army. Therefore information requested needs to predominately support capability to provide personnel who have authority to affect changes to proprietary code.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE SEE ATTACHMENT FOR MARKET SURVEY; THE BELOW IS JUST A DESCRIPTION OF THE BULK FUEL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.
<p>The objective of this market research is to determine if existing commercial or non-developmental items are available and suitable to fulfill the Army's requirement for bulk petroleum semitrailers described below. There is no risk to you for participating in this survey. This is an important opportunity for you to influence the solicitation provisions and contract clauses, our budget requests, and the full range of other elements supporting the acquisition strategy for this program. As currently envisioned, the bulk petroleum semitrailers will consist of a capacity of at least 7,500 (T) gallons up to 10,000 gallons (O). This capacity provides bulk petroleum in the quantity mandated by the future Modular Force concept. An increased capacity to 10,000 gallons of fuels (e.g., JP-5, JP-8, Jet-A, Jet-A1, F-24, and diesel) is desirable to minimize the number of transportation assets. The BFDS tankers do not require an on board pump. The semitrailers will be capable of issuing, receiving, and storing kerosene based fuels (i.e. Jet Propellant (JP) JP-5, JP-8, Jet-A, Jet-A1, F24) and diesel fuel. These tankers must be able to carry maximum product while maintaining the ability to negotiate improved roads and environments under varying operational requirements. The tankers will be transportable by all modes of military and commercial transportation including rail, highway, and marine when filled to capacity IAW MIL-STD-1366. The tanker shall use the M915A3 and M915A5 Military Tractor Truck as the prime mover. The tanker will be capable of top and bottom fill and will be transportable at any level of fuel. In addition, the tanker must have an integrated tank gauging capability that monitors the quantity of fuel within the tanker and provides a digital readout to the operator. The accuracy of the tank gauging capability must be 99.5% or better. The Army is interested in maximizing the volume that can be towed within the limits of the M915A3 and M915A5 truck prime mover.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a promise to issue an RFP or formal acquisition in the future. This RFI does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever nor does it intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Finance (CBPOF) is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. All who respond to this RFI are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or inquiries, nor the U.S. Government's use of such information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the Interested Party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future procurement, if any, is released.
<p>Based on the response to this RFI, a determination to compete or not to compete a future procurement is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. If a solicitation is released, it will be advertised on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website, or the GSA eBuy website depending on acquisition strategy established. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this RFI or a future solicitation.</p>
<p>CBPOF is conducting market research for a future requirement. This is an RFI released pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 - Market Research and Part 15.201(e). This RFI's purpose is to obtain market information on viable sources for maintenance/troubleshooting on already existing middleware used in the Electronic Collection of CBP revenue.</p>
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>1.0 The foundation of Customs and Border Protection's current Electronic Collection Systems (ECS) software originates from 1999 with the NCR XR7. Initially, the software was developed for Windows NT. Restaurant Industry Systems, Inc. (RIS) had to acquire independent software libraries to handle network communications, data base indexes, screen grid handling, Remote Job Entry (RJE) and Message Queueing (MQ) communications.</p>
<p>Through the following 10+ years, RIS updated ECS software for Windows 2000 and Windows XP platforms with new compilers and updated independent software libraries. The current Visual Studio development environment for Windows 7 includes many previously acquired independent software libraries as part of its standard portfolio. Through the same 10+ years, RIS provided point of sale (POS) platform changes in the ECS software. This RFI is only for maintenance and troubleshooting on the current middleware.</p>
<p>The following is a list of ECS software updates that have been completed over the past 15 years: <br /><br />&bull; 1999 - Polling for 2170<br />&bull; 2000 - Polling for 7448<br />&bull; 2000 - Migrate to WAN/LAN<br />&bull; 2004 - TGA Reporting<br />&bull; 2005 - Real Pos 70<br />&bull; 2006 - CSV Export Utility<br />&bull; 2007 - Time Intervals<br />&bull; 2007 - Split and assign dollar amount to combined class codes<br />&bull; 2007 - Real Pos and RIS database synchronization<br />&bull; 2011 - RIS Software Upgrade<br />&bull; 2012 - RIS Software Upgrade for Windows 7 and Manager Workstation <br />(MWS) Software rollout to Active Directory (AD) domain<br />&bull; 2015 - RIS/MWS 2.2 Update</p>
<p><br />REQUIREMENTS</p>

<DESC>1. BACKGROUND<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rising populations in and around cities worldwide are causing substantial mobility issues. There is increasing geographical sprawl of urban areas and commute times are ever-rising, both due to increasing commuting distances and increasing congestion on roads and public transit. Meanwhile, a convergence of evolving technologies, such as electric propulsion and autonomous systems, is enabling transformational changes in aircraft design and operation. There is interest, therefore, in expanding the metropolitan transport network into the air, a paradigm often referred to as Urban Air Mobility (UAM). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate created the UAM Coordination and Assessment Team (UCAT) to define an Agency-level strategy for enabling UAM. In this strategy, the development of standards and conducting validation of integration of airspace technologies such as Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance (CNS) would be required to enable medium density and complexity operations. This statement of work seeks to investigate various approaches to providing reliable, secure, and economically viable UAM CNS services.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the UAM strategic planning efforts, the UCAT defined a series UAM Maturity Levels (UMLs) to aid in understanding how UAM operations will progress towards fully commercialized, autonomous operations. The UMLs definitions and maturation timeframe estimates are:<br /><br />UML-1 (Present-Early 2020s): Late-Stage Certification Testing and Operational Demonstrations in Limited Environments Aircraft certification testing and operational evaluations with conforming prototypes; procedural and technology innovation supporting future airspace operations (e.g., UTM-inspired); community/market demonstrations and data collection UML-2 (Mid 2020s): Low Density and Complexity Commercial Operations with Assistive Automation Type certified aircraft; initial Part 135 operation approvals; limited markets with favorable weather and regulation; small UAM network serving urban periphery; UTM Construct and UAM corridors supporting self-managed operations through controlled airspace UML-3 (Late 2020s): Low Density, Medium Complexity Operations with Comprehensive Safety Assurance Automation<br />Operations into urban core; operational validation of airspace, UTM inspired ATM, CNS, C2, and automation for scalable, weather-tolerant operations; closely space UAM pads, ports; noise compatible with urban soundscape; model-local regulations <br />UML-4 (Early 2030s): Medium Density and Complexity Operations with Collaborative and Responsible Automated Systems 100s of simultaneous operations; expanded networks including high-capacity UAM ports; many UTM inspired ATM services available, simplified vehicle operations for credit; low-visibility operations <br />UML-5 (Late 2030s): High Density and Complexity Operations with Highly Integrated Automated Networks 1,000s of simultaneous operations; large-scale, highly-distributed networks; high-density UTM inspired ATM; autonomous aircraft and remote, M:N fleet management; high-weather tolerance including icing; high-volume manufacturing<br />UML-6 (2040s): Ubiquitous UAM Operations with System-Wide Automated Optimization<br />10,000s of simultaneous operations (capacity limited by physical infrastructure); ad hoc landing sites; noise compatible with suburban/rural operations; private ownership &amp; operation models enabled; societal expectation <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first two UMLs focus heavily on development, testing, and initial operations of FAA-certified UAM aircraft. The CNS challenges become significant in UML-3 and especially UML-4, where UAM operators will manage a densely populated airspace in and around urban city centers. The last two UMLs will accommodate even greater numbers of aircraft and will require significant levels of automation and integration to safely manage the airspace.
<p>2. SCOPE<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scope of this work is to investigate and provide recommendations on viable CNS systems and technologies to enable safe, secure, and efficient UAM NAS operations to support UML-4 operations. While UML-4 is the primary concern, the contractor shall also consider if and how each approach could support nearer-term flight-testing at UMLs 2 and 3. The contractor shall also consider the extensibility of each approach to support UML-6.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no expectation of hardware or software deliverables. The contractor shall disclose all tools, methodologies, models, and simulations used to arrive at the recommendations. The Contractor should consider mature candidate technologies (e.g., cellular, satellite, GPS, RTCA SC-228 work, etc.), but this study is not limited to existing approaches due to the expected timeframe for UML-4, which allows for the maturation of technologies currently in early-stage development. <br /><br />UAM operations include the transportation of both passengers and cargo in and around metropolitan areas. This study should primarily focus on vehicles sized to carry passengers, but should also consider the broader UAM system, which will require coordination between passenger-carrying UAM operations, small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS), and other operations in the current and future National Airspace System (NAS) in order to safely share the airspace. This study should also consider the interoperability of CNS services between UAM operators and other flight service providers in the NAS as a means of further improving coordination. <br />For this study, UAM aircraft are assumed to operate up to 4,000 ft. above ground level in and around metropolitan areas and potentially using Class B, C, D, E, and G airspaces. The CNS approaches surveyed in this study should be capable of providing the required services in this airspace domain.<br /><br />3. OBJECTIVES<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Contractor shall conduct and document a study that informs NASA about various technical approaches to providing reliable and secure CNS services to support UAM operations at UML-4, with special considerations for early test and deployment at UML-2 and 3, as well as extensibility considerations to UML-6. The UAM community will use the results and recommendations of this study to improve understanding of the current state-of-the-art, aid in efforts to prioritize UAM challenges, identify technology gaps, and better inform decision-makers.<br /><br />4. TASK DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>4.1. The Contractor shall develop and deliver a report that addresses the following considerations:<br />4.1.1. Communications<br />4.1.1.1. Data Service Requirements - The Contractor shall investigate, identify and describe critical (e.g., control, telemetry, detect-and-avoid, etc.) and desirable non-critical (e.g., passenger data services) data services needed by Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) to support UAM operations. For each data service, the Contractor shall provide comments on important metrics that could affect the design of the communications network, which may include packet size, latency, acceptability of data loss, cybersecurity concerns, data frequency, and expected data throughput. <br />4.1.1.2. Wireless Links - The Contractor shall study and provide recommendations on reliable and secure wireless links for UAM aircraft to support the data services recommended in Task 4.1.1.1. All radio technologies may be considered here (e.g., air-to-ground, vehicle-to-vehicle, satellite, etc.), and the study is not bound by existing standards.<br />4.1.1.3. Ground-Based Network Architecture - The Contractor shall study and provide recommendations on a reliable and secure network architecture to connect all ground-based CNS assets. This task includes the identification of what CNS assets (e.g., communication towers, radar sites, UAS operations centers, ATC towers, etc.) are required to support UAM and how they should be securely networked together.<br />4.1.2. Navigation<br />4.1.2.1. Navigational Requirements - The Contractor shall study and provide recommendations on the navigational requirements needed to provide safe and secure UAM operations in urban environments.<br />4.1.2.2. Navigation Technologies - The Contractor shall study and provide recommendations on the technologies required for meeting the navigational requirements recommended in task 4.1.2.1. The recommendations may include multiple technologies as part of an ensemble approach to meeting the navigational requirements.<br />4.1.2.3. Denied Navigation - The Contractor shall study and provide recommendations on technological approaches for achieving safe and secure navigational performance when navigational services are unavailable or compromised.<br />4.1.2.4. Augmented Navigation During Take-Off and Landing - The Contractor shall study and provide recommendations on technological approaches for improving navigational capability in areas of denser traffic, e.g., take-off and landing sites or places where routes cross, where UAM aircraft densities and the probability for accidents will be increased. <br />4.1.3. Surveillance<br />4.1.3.1. UAM Aircraft Detection and Tracking - The Contractor shall study and provide recommendations for a means of detecting and tracking UAM aircraft in the operational urban airspace. It can be assumed that these aircraft are connected to the UAM communications infrastructure and airspace operations management system, and can be communicated with if this will improve the ability to surveil the airspace.<br />4.1.3.2. Non-UAM Aircraft Detection, Tracking, and Identification - The Contractor shall study and provide recommendations for a means of detecting, tracking, and identifying non-UAM aircraft or non-cooperative UAM aircraft in the operational airspace. <br />4.1.3.3. Non-Aircraft Detection, Tracking, and Identification - The Contractor shall study and provide recommendations for a means of detecting, tracking, and identifying non-aircraft objects in the operational airspace that may pose a safety risk to UAM aircraft. This task shall consider what types of objects may be found in UAM airspace and the risk level that each poses to UAM aircraft.<br />4.1.4. Integrated CNS Considerations<br />4.1.4.1. Avionics Guidelines and Standards - The Contractor shall study and provide recommendations on guidelines and standards for the design, certification, and maintenance of the UAM CNS avionics hardware and software recommended in the previous tasks. <br />4.1.4.2. Avionics Architecture - The Contractor shall study and provide recommendations on what the best design practices and requirements should be regarding the architecture of CNS avionics hardware and software. This includes but is not limited to the study of Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA).<br />4.1.4.3. Exploiting CNS Functional Commonality - The Contractor shall study and provide recommendations on approaches for integrating CNS functions into multi-purpose hardware and software architectures. The intent includes, but is not limited, to reducing the Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) footprint of CNS avionics and improving overall CNS system performance by sharing CNS data between various subsystems. <br />4.1.4.4. Efficient Usage of Spectrum - The Contractor shall study and provide recommendations on approaches to increase frequency utilization by sharing spectrum across the communications, navigation, and surveillance functional domains. Examples of this could be the inclusion of positional data within a data communications link to aid in navigation and using the RF signature of this link to aid in airspace surveillance. This effort shall also identify any policy or regulatory barriers to more efficient spectrum use, but shall not assume the allocation of additional spectrum. The above refers to approaches beyond conventional means of improving spectral efficiency (e.g., coding, modulation, etc.), which are already known to the community of practice. <br />4.1.5. Small UAS Interoperability Considerations<br />4.1.5.1. Shared Airspace CNS Concept of Operations - The Contractor shall provide recommendations on a CNS concept of operations that emphasizes how multiple small UAS and UAM operators may safely share the same CNS infrastructure and spectrum. Special consideration shall be given towards understanding what data should be shared between operators, how this data should be shared, and how CNS service interoperability may improve or reduce the safety of the airspace. <br />4.1.5.2. CNS Interoperability between UAM and sUAS Operations - If recommended in Task 4.1.5.1, the Contractor shall provide recommendations on how to achieve CNS service interoperability between UAM and sUAS operations. It is important to consider here that the CNS service requirements for passenger-carrying UAM operations are likely to be more restrictive than what is necessary for small UAS. <br />4.2. The Contractor shall maintain communication with and accept feedback and input from NASA technical personnel throughout the duration of the contract. This task requirement may be satisfied through the execution of items 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4 as listed in Section 5 of this SOW.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull;	your business's capacity, or potential approach to achieving capacity, to conduct the requirements of SRACES (with capacity referring to matters such as satisfying the magnitude of the tasking, having the necessary specialized experience, and the size of the staff necessary); respondents should cross reference to specific past performance examples, or site specific evidence of how your business would achieve required capacity by the first day of performance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull;	the identification of the most salient aspect(s) of the SRACES technical requirements (i.e., from either the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Mission Services Estimated Annual Banding Levels, and/or Work Order Management System (WOMS)) the respondent determines as being key in submitting a credible proposal in response to a future SRACES solicitation (for the purpose of evaluation by the Government)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull;	your business's capabilities to provide a fully functional electronic work order management system (WOMS) that meets all requirements outlined in the "SRACES RFI DRAFT Work Order Management System (WOMS)" attachment to this RFI on the first day of performance of an awarded contract</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull;	the identification of any SRACES technical requirements (i.e., Performance Work Statement (PWS), Mission Services Estimated Annual Banding Levels, Work Order Management System (WOMS)) that are not clear and/or are outside of your business's capabilities, such that it would limit your business's ability from meeting all of the stated SRACES technical requirements (e.g., identify any specific aspects that would prevent your business from fully satisfying all of the SRACES WOMS technical requirements)</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify capable sources for the requirements outlined in the description below and the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). This notice does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotation) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.
<p>All information submitted in response to this notice is voluntary, and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing information provided to the Government. This Sources Sought Notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes.</p>
<p>1. Description of Desired Capabilities</p>
<p>The NASA Shared Services Center (NSSC) at Stennis Space Center anticipates a future requirement for a commercially available Legal Document Management and Case Management / Docketing System ("System") similar to those in use by private legal practices. The Contractor shall provide an enterprise-level system for use by approximately 200 concurrent users located at NASA's Office of General Counsel (OGC) at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., and at the Office of Chief Counsel at various NASA Centers.</p>
<p>2. Comprehensive Requirements</p>
<p>As noted above, NASA legal is a dispersed legal counsel organization across the NASA centers and locations listed above. Each location has a Chief Counsel Office that reports to the NASA General Counsel at NASA Headquarters.  NASA currently has various siloed solutions in use supporting the OGC. Many locations are still paper-based using standard Microsoft Office products (i.e. Excel) to track matters and cases.  Other NASA centers have automated tools that include Sharepoint solutions or custom Action-Tracking systems while others have an actual Case Management/ Docketing and Document Management system.  It is entirely possible that a system in its current form meets the business need of one center, but is not scalable across the NASA Legal Community and does not provide the robust agency-wide Knowledge Management requirements for the enterprise system that is the object of this solicitation. None of these current solutions is accessible from one NASA center to another and provides the functions that are detailed below. This solicitation aims to select a single enterprise commercial off the shelf (COTS) solution that can be utilized across the disparate NASA centers for the purpose of providing a unified and consistent solution across the agency.  Please review the attached PWS for a full detail of requirements.</p>
<p>3.   Virtual Industry Day:<br />The Government will be holding a virtual industry day for interested parties on Tuesday, April 23, 2019 at 1PM Central Time. The event is expected to last about 90 minutes and will provide the Government the opportunity to discuss the requirement and answer questions. Vendors will also be able to participate in the site visit remotely by accessing the following link and dialing into the following number.<br />Conference Line: 1-844-467-6272 or 1-720-259-6462; Participant code: 768085</p>
<p>Skype Link:   Join Skype Meeting or https://meet.lync.com/nasa.gov/lou.nosenzo/ZTH4ZYVS</p>
<p><br />4. Submission Instructions</p>
<p>Responses to this sources sought notice must be submitted in writing. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Proprietary information should be marked accordingly. The response must be received by 26 April 2019, 4:00 p.m., Central Standard Time.  Submissions shall be addressed to the contracting office and personnel outlined below. The Statement of Capabilities (SOC) must provide the following information as a part of its cover sheet:<br /> <br />(a) Company name and address;<br />(b) Business size and type<br />(c)  Point of Contact;<br />(d)  Phone/E-mail;<br />(e)  NAICS Codes;<br />(f)   Information regarding company's capabilities</p>
<p>The Government is primarily interested in identifying qualified sources capable of meeting the technical and programmatic requirements outlined in the draft PWS.  Responses are limited to ten (10) single-sided 8.5" x 11" pages with 1" margins, and 12-point font (Arial or Times New Roman).</p>
<p><br />Responses from small businesses and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.  A responding firm should indicate if it is a small business, a HUBZone small business, a service-disabled veteran-owned small business, a woman-owned small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, an 8(a) firm, a historically black college or university, or a minority institution.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services, has been selected for this requirement.  The small business size standard is 27.5M.</p>
<p>Submit the SOC electronically to the Contract Specialist, Mr. Joseph R. Tynes at Joseph.tynes@nasa.gov and to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Justin Fraser at Justin.s.fraser@nasa.gov</p>

<DESC>**This is not a request for proposals, bids, or quotes. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for information received because of this announcement. **

This is a Sources Sought notice to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified
sources to perform a potential requirement. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Lexington, Kentucky (KY) Medical Center (LEX VAMC) is seeking qualified business contractors, preferably SDVOSB/VOSBs to provide a digital turn-key solution to patient flow management at all three laboratory sections.  

Sousley campus, 2250 Leestown Rd., Lexington, KY 40511
 Laboratory waiting area is shared with the specialty clinics and Emergency Room. 

Bowling Campus, 1101 Veterans Drive, Lexington, KY 40502 
Laboratory waiting area is located at Building 1 shared with Prosthetics, and in Building 16, not shared with any other section. 
BACKGROUND:  
Currently, laboratory has no digital solution with insufficient staff to cover Veteran check-in for laboratory services. Both deficiencies cumulatively and negatively impact a Veteran s ability to receive needed laboratory services in a timely and efficient manner. 

BASIC REQUIREMENT:
Each location will have the following:
One easily located fixed station for Veteran patient to approach with a pre-set selection of services to choose from. The Veteran makes his/her selection and receives a printout/ticket that identifies the service requested and the number/order in which it was received. At the same time, the laboratory staff receive notice that someone is waiting for service and can announce their readiness to receive the Veteran patient via various visual and audible cues. The Veteran patient sees or hears his/her number called and proceeds to receive the service desired. Once complete, the Veteran patient leaves and the cycle repeats. System will have means for staff to mitigate excessive wait-times and provide management oversight. 

INSTALLATION CONSIDERATIONS: 
Products are to have the least amount of impact to pre-existing structures in the facility. 

Installation will be done during normal business hours Monday thru Friday from 8am to 4pm.

DIGITAL CONSIDERATIONS:
Any software must be compatible with Windows 10 OS, and hardware must be compatible with existing PC structure.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
No actual design or construction work will be performed. Options are not considered.
LEX VAMC is in the process of determining the availability and capabilities of potential small businesses meeting the previously-described requirement before issuing a solicitation for a firm-fixed price contract that represents the best value for the government. The successful firm shall be required to have a full understanding of possible program or project objectives, the approval process, budget, contract documents, and the principles of Federal contracting and contract administration.

If no responses are received from potentially responsible sources, LEX VAMC and its supporting contracting office   NCO-9 - under FAR part 19.501(b) will have completed its due diligence regarding setting this procurement aside for small businesses and will proceed with procuring this requirement on an unrestricted basis.



This procurement, whether it be set-aside for small business or procured on an unrestricted basis, seeks to be made under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541519   Information Technology Value-Added Reseller. The small business size standard for NAICS code 541519 is 150 employees.

NOTE:
An Information Technology Value Added Reseller (ITVAR) provides a total solution to information technology acquisitions by providing multi-vendor hardware and software along with significant value-added services. Significant value-added services consist of, but are not limited to, configuration consulting and design, systems integration, installation of multi-vendor computer equipment, customization of hardware or software, training, product technical support, maintenance, and end user support. For purposes of Government procurement, an information technology procurement classified under this exception and 150-employee size standard must consist of at least 15% and not more than 50% of value-added services, as measured by the total contract price. In addition, the offeror must comply with the manufacturing performance requirements, or comply with the non-manufacturer rule by supplying the products of small business concerns, unless SBA has issued a class or contract specific waiver of the non-manufacturer rule. If the contract consists of less than 15% of value-added services, then it must be classified under a NAICS manufacturing industry. If the contract consists of more than 50% of value-added services, then it must be classified under the NAICS industry that best describes the predominate service of the procurement.

An example of what the above NOTE means for an ITVAR is the following:

A small business sells manufacturer software and hardware [products] and separately provides value-added services that are between 15% and 50% of the total contract price to implement that software or hardware to user demands.  The ITVAR does not pass both manufacturer products and manufacturer value-added services to the user or vice-versa. If that happens the ITVAR is not an ITVAR but a pass-through entity and not eligible for consideration.   


All information submitted is subject to verification. Additional information may be requested to substantiate responses. If interested, please respond via email to the following:  

1)Identify the socioeconomic status of your business (For additional information on small business concerns visit www.sba.gov). 
SDVOSB/VOSB must be listed as verified in VIP database at: https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov.
2) Provide what value-added service will be done on your part and what Manufacturer product you distribute.
 a. Include a manufacturer brochure
 
3) Identify whether you are a manufacturer or not. 
4) Identify if interested in a site-visit during solicitation period.
5) If a large business, identify whether this requirement will afford subcontracting to a small business concern, and the small business concern s socioeconomic status that you normally subcontract with (e.g. HUD, 8(a),
SDVOSB/VOSB, etc.).
6) Identify whether this requirement can be completed entirely under a GSA FSS delivery/task order, NASA-SEWP, or Open Market. 
7)Provide current and active FSS or NASA-SEWP contract number.

Each response shall be reviewed by the Contracting Officer/Specialist for determining whether there exists reasonable expectation of obtaining enough offers from responsible small businesses that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery. A determination not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All information furnished to the Government in response to this notice will be used for review purposes only. 
The complete packaged response should be emailed to Sascha Hertslet at Sascha.hertslet@va.gov under the subject line  Sources Sought Notice # 36C24919Q0250. 
Interested parties are encouraged to point to any part of this solicitation that they feel is not reasonable or in-line with current commercial practices and offer alternative solutions/ corrective points.
The DUE DATE for responses is Thursday, April 25, 2019 by 3:00 p.m. (CST). Any responses past that due date and time will be considered non-responsive.

<p>4. Project Description. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, Portland District, requires the fabrication and delivery of top plates, seat rings, packing boxes, oil sumps and seat rings. The turbine top plate is installed in the interior head cover assembly. It mounts to the inner flange of the inner head cover with and is located directly above the turbine runner. Its primary purpose is to keep water from entering the powerhouse and help provide structural rigidity to the head cover assembly. The seat ring is installed between the inner head cover and the turbine hub and its main purpose is to seal and prevent leakage at this interface. The packing box and the oil sump are mounted to the top plate. The packing box is used to provide a water seal around the rotating shaft. The oil sump is an oil reservoir for lubrication of the turbine guide bearing. The following is the list of all items to be fabricated and delivered:</p>
<p>1. Six (6) Top plate assemblies including fasteners.<br />2. Six (6) Packing box assemblies including fasteners. <br />3. Six (6) Oil sump assemblies including fasteners<br />4. Six (6) Seat ring assemblies including fasteners</p>
<p>All components will be provided with their respective fasteners as shown on the drawings and as detailed in the specifications.</p>
<p>The work will require the contractor to provide the capability to perform fabrication of thick weldments, stress relieving of large components as well as machining and painting services.</p>
<p>The largest component is the approximate 7500 pound top plate. The top plate is a 125" diameter, 2" thick plate with radial stiffeners welded to it. This weldment will require the contractor to have the ability to produce sound full penetration welds on the 2" thick plate around the inner circumference. This component is fabricated in halves and fastened and doweled at the vertical flange.</p>
<p>The approximate 5000 pound packing box is a welded fabrication consisting of 2" thick plate requiring a near full penetration weld on the inner diameter. Radial gussets will be fillet welded to the plate. The packing box is fabricated in two halves and fastened and doweled at the vertical flange.</p>
<p>The approximate 1000 pound sump is an oil tight sump that contains hydraulic bearing lube oil. It is a welded fabrication containing mostly fillet welds. The wall thickness of the sump is predominately &frac14; inch steel plate with a &frac34; in bottom section. This sump will have to be pressure tested to 10 psi for 8 hours.</p>
<p>The approximate 400 pound seat ring is approximately &frac34;"thick plate, 133" in diameter and 4" in width. <br /><br />The contractor's machine shop must have equipment large enough to accommodate the 125 inch diameter of the sump plate. All of the above components which have been described in very general terms shall be thermally stress relieved after fabrication and prior to final machining. Other machining requirements include finish machining tolerances of 0.010" and surface finishes of up to 16 microns on mating faces. <br />In addition the metal fabrication requirements mentioned above, the contract will require that the new parts be coated with a vinyl-zinc paint system.</p>

Please send your responses utilizing the Draft RFQ Comment Template provided within the draft solicitation via email to Anna.zinser@va.gov ; William.Nalls@va.gov ; Judith.Ruggiero@va.gov; Carol.Domingue@va.gov.  The Government will take into consideration all comments received by the response due date but does not intend to post responses to the comments received.  
The forthcoming RFQ will be issued under the following pre-solicitation notice:
PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF TIERED EVALUATIONS:  This procurement is set-aside based on an order of priority as established in 38 U.S.C. 8127. TIERED EVALUATIONS INCLUDING LARGE BUSINESS CONCERNS: This solicitation is being issued as a tiered evaluation with the following tiers: (1) SDVOSB concerns, (2) VOSB concerns, (3) small business concerns with HUBZone small business concerns and 8(a) participants having priority; and (4) large business concerns. If award cannot be made, the solicitation will be cancelled and the requirement resolicited.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to issue Request for Quotes (RFQ) for the acquisition of consumable commodities in support of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program catalog.  The MSPV Program is a partnering effort between Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA) and the VA Office of Acquisition, Logistics and Construction (OALC) to deliver a national strategic sourcing solution that combines a formulary approach with electronic cataloging and ordering of a wide range of medical and surgical supplies for the Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMC) and related facilities. The establishment of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) is in direct support of this initiative and is a key element in the success of the MSPV Program as the BPAs will provide the mechanism that will supply the estimated 49,000 types of supplies for distribution to all VHA facilities located in the United States (US), US Territories, and other government agencies.  In order to support the MSPV Program, the VA will establish BPAs for medical/surgical supplies, with a preference for FSS BPAs under FAR Part 8, and for supplies not available on FSS, through Open Market BPAs under FAR Parts 12/13. Each of these solicitations will be structured as a tiered evaluation to maximize Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business (SD/VOSB) participation. Quotations will be evaluated based on clinical utility, price, and past performance.  VHA clinicians will participate in evaluating all supplier quotations and awards will be made using comparative analysis.  An Authorized Distributor Letter from the Manufacturer shall be included with all responses.  The Authorized Distributor Letter from the Manufacturer shall include for each product(s) proposed authorizing the Offeror as a distributor for the proposed product(s).  The letter must either state specific product(s) proposed or that the Offeror is an authorized distributor for all of the Manufacturer s products.  This letter must be on the Manufacturer s letterhead and contain the signature of an authorized official for the Manufacturer.  In order for the authorized distributor/supplier to participate in the MSPV Program, the authorized distributor/supplier and the Prime Vendor shall establish a Commercial Agreement within 30 days of this award. The Commercial Agreement will govern the terms and conditions of the authorized distributor/supplier relationship and will not contradict the underlying terms and conditions established by this BPA or the underlying MSPV Contract.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 339113.  Any future amendments and other miscellaneous documents will be available electronically for download at the following URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. No paper copies of the solicitation will be available, and no telephone requests for paper copies of the solicitation will be accepted. Interested offerors are advised to continuously check this URL for any changes to this solicitation. All responsible sources may submit an offer that if timely received, will be considered. The point of contact for this procurement is Carol Domingue@va.gov and Anna Zinser@va.gov.

<DESC>This is a Special Notice of intent to procure a Nuvair Voyager IV Commercial Duty Nitrox generating system and associated components. The Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center owns an inventory of spare filters and parts that are compatible between the current and new proposed systems. By utilizing a single brand of Nitrox equipment across multiple platforms (PIFSC, NOAA Dive Center and the NOAA Ship Hiialakai) NOAA increases redundancy, maximizes the crossover of spare parts, reduces staff training time and are better positioned for underway troubleshooting/repairs.
<p>PIFSC proposes to purchase the required instrumentation on a sole source basis from NUVAIR, Inc. The Government intends to acquire the equipment using FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in conjunction with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a firm-fixed-price purchase order with an approximate delivery date of January 7, 2019. The NAICS code for this procurement is 333912 with a corresponding size standard of 1,000nemployees.

Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <br /><br />A determination not to compete this requirement is solely the Government's discretion as it is the Government's belief that only Ocean Instruments can provide the requirements as stated above.<br /><br />All vendors doing business with the Government are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in SAM. For additional information, and to register, please see www.sam.gov. All offerors must also obtain a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number.

<DESC>Prequalification of Sources<br />For<br />Horizontal Construction Contracts<br />For Southwestern Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements
<p>This is a PREQUALIFICATION OF SOURCES announcement, issued in accordance with DFARS 236.272. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests. Respondents will be notified of the results of the Prequalification of Sources Selection.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Fort Worth District is seeking to create a Prequalified Sources List for horizontal construction projects in support of the Border Infrastructure Program along the US-Mexico border. The Prequalified Sources List will be available for use while other acquisitions are underway for similar requirements. It is anticipated that use of the Prequalified Sources List will occur for up to 18 months after the list is established, and possibly longer. The Prequalified Sources List will be used as a vehicle to solicit several stand-alone "C" type construction contracts with a total value of up to approximately $8B. Only firms on the Prequalified Sources List will be eligible to compete for these solicitations.</p>
<p>The Border Infrastructure projects that are likely to advertised to the firms on the Prequalified Sources List include a mix of border fence, border wall, border patrol roads, border access roads, border lights, border gates (for access to border monuments, for maintenance, and for Border Patrol operational use), border drainage improvements, levee walls, and other miscellaneous improvements, repairs, and alterations.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for procurements offered to firms on the Prequalified Sources list is 237310, Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction, which has a small business size standard of $36.5M.</p>
<p>Bonding Requirements (Specific to Individual "C" type Contracts to be Awarded): Pursuant to the Miller Act, Performance and Payment bonds shall be provided for each project awarded under the Prequalified Sources List. Notice to Proceed (NTP), will not be issued until after the selected offeror provides sufficient bonding to cover the work required as communicated under the project solicitation.</p>
<p>Process for Qualification: The Prequalified Sources List will be established by Fort Worth District. The projects intended to be awarded via solicitation to the Prequalified Sources List may be awarded by any USACE District.</p>
<p>An industry day conference will be held via webinar approximately 15 days after this announcement is posted and will be open to parties interested in being considered for inclusion in the Prequalified Sources List. Specific time and location will be announced via amendment to this posting within 72 hours of the initial announcement.</p>
<p>To be considered qualified for the Prequalified Sources List, firms must meet the following minimum requirements (additional information on required responses is detailed in the attached questionnaire including standards of acceptance where applicable):</p>
<p>1. Single bonding capability of at least $1.5B and aggregate bonding capability of at least $5B.</p>
<p>2. Capability to perform at least three $500M construction contracts concurrently.</p>
<p>3. Completed a horizontal construction contract in the Contiguous United States with a contract price of $100M or more within the last five years (including identification of the project and a brief description.) Offerors should also include the performance rating (if any) by the owner on the questionnaire (item 3g.), if the offeror was rated.</p>
<p>4. An accounting system that can support Fixed-Price Economic Price Adjustment (FPEPA) and Fixed-Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) contracts.</p>
<p>5. Ability to successfully comply with the provisions of FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns.</p>
<p>6. Acceptable responses on implementation approach for construction of the planned type of border infrastructure in a remote construction sites in the Southwestern United States adjacent to the International Border with Mexico. (Refer to the Prequalification of Sources Questionnaire for acceptability criteria and additional details).</p>
<p>7. Certification that all responses to the Prequalification of Sources Questionnaire are accurate and complete by a principal of the firm.</p>
<p>Past Performance: Offerors are required to provide customer reference name(s), company affiliation and current contact information (phone number and email address) for the horizontal construction contract in the Contiguous United States with a contract price of $100M or more within the last 5 years (beginning from June 2013) (questionnaire item 3). For Federal projects submitted, the Offeror should submit finalized CCASS or CPARS reports, otherwise the customer reference(s) and contract information in response to the FBO questionnaire will be considered for the Offeror and its team members. Offerors shall include relevant past performance information in the narrative submitted in response to item 6 (see item 6f) on the questionnaire. This may include information for non-Federal projects at the discretion of the Offeror. Offerors should be aware provided information will be subject to verification. Offerors are advised that the Government could review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance including for projects other than those provided. Other potential sources that the Government may review include past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture or teaming arrangement) identified in the offeror's responses, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the Offeror. Offerors are also advised that the burden of providing accurate and relevant past performance information rests with the Offeror.</p>
<p>All firms submitting documentation meeting the standards for prequalification will be placed on the Prequalified Sources List and will receive fair opportunity to compete for each action advertised to the firms on the Prequalified of Sources List. As noted, the purpose of the Prequalified Sources List is to facilitate solicitation of several specific standalone "C" type contracts. All such contracts solicited from the Prequalified Sources List are expected to be Design-Build (DB) or Design-Bid-Build (DBB). Responses submitted to the Prequalification of Sources Questionnaire and associated narrative responses will not only be used to determine qualification for the Prequalified Sources List, but will also be used in Phase I of the two-step DB selection process.</p>
<p>The Government will provide all of the firms on the Prequalified Sources List notification of its intent to advertise a requirement. The notification will include a brief summary of the requirement, evaluation criteria for Phase I, general information about the evaluation criteria that will be used for the Phase II solicitation, and a request for each firm to provide the Government with a positive or negative statement of interest in proposing on the project. The government will not request additional information beyond confirmation of interest for the Phase I evaluation.</p>
<p>The firms will be provided a closing date by which they must respond positively or negatively to their interest in competing on the specific project. Any pre-qualified firm that fails to respond to the notification of intent within the allowed time will not be considered for award. The notification from the Government will also state that the Government will conduct its Phase I evaluation by considering information on hand; including the implementation approach narratives and past performance information provided to the Government in response to the Prequalification of Sources Announcement.</p>
<p>After the specified closing date for receipt of interest, the Government will consider each firm's competitive qualifications (implementation approach as provided during the prequalification selection process and past performance data), which will represent Phase 1 of the two-phase selection process. Up to 5 most highly qualified firms will be selected to submit Phase II proposals.</p>
<p>Project-specific Phase II solicitations will be sent to the most highly qualified firms.<br /><br />Any prequalified firm that expressed interest in the competitive Phase 1 process that is not included in the list of most highly qualified firms, may request a debrief from the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />Phase 2 Process:</p>
<p>The receipt of proposals due date will generally be 30 days after issuance of a project solicitation.</p>
<p>Selection will be based on Best Value Trade-Off (BVTO) or Low-Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedures. The solicitation may state an intention to award based on initial offers received without discussions.

<p><br />EVALUATION FACTOR 2: Price</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a total price for CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0002). The Government will determine the Total Evaluated Price (TEP) by totaling the sum of CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0002. Adequate price competition per FAR 15.403-1(c)(1) is anticipated and may exist if, in part, two (2) or more offers are received that satisfy the Government's requirements. To ensure the existence of competitive offers, price analysis will be utilized to evaluate the price reasonableness of each offer. The Government may compare Contractor's quoted price to an Independent Government Estimate (IGE) or may use other price analysis techniques per FAR 15.404-1. Adequate price competition will not exist with the receipt of only one offer; therefore if only one offer is received IAW DoD final rule amending DFARS 215.371 the need for additional data through subsequent negotiations is eliminated if the CO can determine that the offered price is fair and reasonable and adequate price competition exists.

<RESPDATE>052019
<CONTACT>Patricia A. Kleiman, Contract Specialist, Email patricia.a.kleiman.civ@mail.mil - William R.Fells , Contracting Specialist, Email william.r.fells.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of the Defense Production Act Title III Program Office (DPA Title III Office) seeks to enter into a Section 815 Prototype Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) for Thin Wall Castings for Aerospace Applications under the Other Transactions Authority (OTA). This notice is considered a competitive combined synopsis/solicitation, therefore, this announcement constitutes the only synopsis or solicitation that will be released.
<p>Complex, aerospace-grade, thin-wall, multi-core magnesium and aluminum sand-cast components are critical to support Commercial and DoD rotorcraft fleets as maintenance and replacement parts, retrofits and technological upgrades. All Commercial and U.S. Military rotorcraft vehicles (helicopters and tiltrotors) require numerous sand-cast components for structural and drivetrain components. These sand castings will also support the manufacture of cutting-edge components for next-generation rotorcraft platforms. At present, the most difficult castings are the large castings that comprise the main rotor gearbox housing pieces.</p>
<p>The industrial base for complex, large, multi-core magnesium and aluminum sand-cast components is characterized by high start-up costs, expensive and lengthy qualification processes, and an aging workforce with rapidly-eroding organizational knowledge and skillsets. The number of domestic castings manufacturers that provide products and services to the aerospace industry has dwindled over the last two decades, having experienced a large number of consolidations due to decreases in production orders and intensified global competition. With few remaining viable foundries, many sand-cast rotorcraft parts have been reduced to only a single-source supplier.</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to improve domestic industrial capability for the manufacturing of Large, Aerospace-Grade (per AMS 2175), Complex (Multi-core), Sand-cast, Thin-wall, Aluminum and Magnesium Castings and demonstrate an improved process with the capability to produce these castings to support DoD rotorcraft fleets in the form of maintenance and replacement parts, retrofits, and technological upgrades, specifically structural and drivetrain components for next-generation rotorcraft platforms. This effort has a dual use application in that it will also help support Commercial rotorcraft fleets. Initial and final manufacturing demonstrations will be conducted to validate the baseline and final capabilities and determine the feasibility of the improved manufacturing process for the castings.</p>
<p>It is expected that the offeror will review all attachments to this notice prior to proposal preparation and submission.</p>
<p>No award will be made unless and until the Government can make a final determination that the proposed solution meets the statutory requirements for use of a prototype OTA and making an award in response to this solicitation is in the best interest of the Government. Any Section 815 Prototype Other Transaction Agreement awarded in response to this Prototype Project Opportunity Notice (PPON) is not anticipated to result in follow-on production.</p>
<p>In addition, each offeror responding to this notice shall be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.acquisition.gov. The representations and certifications made by your Company, including those completed electronically via the SAM shall be incorporated by reference into any resulting OTA that is awarded from this notice.</p>
<p>When submitting a proposal, the offeror shall provide its Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) +4 number. The DUNS+4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the Offeror to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electric Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts. If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An offeror within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. An offeror located outside the United States must call the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The company should indicate that it is an offeror for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>Offerors shall mark business plans and technical information that are to be protected for five years from FOIA disclosure with a legend identifying the documents as being submitted on a confidential basis.</p>
<p>The Government will review all submissions and perform an integrated assessment of each submission in accordance with the evaluation criteria and relative order of importance of the criteria as listed in the PPON. The Government reserves the right to ask questions of a clarifying nature during the submission review process, or to open discussions with all offerors and allow for updated submissions. A notice of the Government's award selection will be announced on FedBizOpps upon the conclusion of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>Any questions related to this PPON must be directed to the Government point of contact identified below by May 3, 2019:</p>
<p>Patricia Kleiman<br />Agreements Specialist, ACC-NJ-ET<br />patricia.a.kleiman.civ@mail.mil</p>
<p>All information submitted in response to this PPON will be at no cost or obligation to the Government. No sensitive or classified information will be discussed.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

level possible before considering the more formal process described below.

Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,

want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.

<p><br /><strong>RFQ SUBMISSION</strong></p>
<p>This announcement will close at 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on March 25, 2019.</p>
<p>Addendum to 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Oct 2018)</p>
<p>1)	Inquiries - Inquiries and all correspondence concerning this solicitation document should be submitted in writing to James Rall, at james.rall@noaa.gov, and Andrew Hildebrandt, at andrew.hildebrandt@noaa.gov, by 2:00 EST on March 15, 2019.  The Government is not required to provide responses to vendor's inquiries or correspondence.</p>
<p>2)	Quotation Preparation</p>
<p>The following instructions apply for the submission of quotes:</p>
<p>a.	Quotes shall be submitted in three (3) separate volumes:<br /> <br /> Volume I - Past Performance <br /> Volume II - Technical<br /> Volume III - Price</p>
<p>b.	The technical volume shall NOT contain any reference to price.  It is incumbent upon the Quoter to provide a technical volume in sufficient detail to provide a clear and concise presentation that includes, but is not limited to, the technical requirements of the RFQ.</p>
<p>c.	The Government will evaluate quotes in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in FAR 52.212-2 of this RFQ.</p>
<p>3)	Quote Instructions</p>
<p>a.	Past Performance:<br />Past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the vendor to successfully meet the requirements of this solicitation. Vendors are required to provide information on no more than five (5) of the firm's most recently completed contracts/orders (not to exceed three (3) years since completion) for like or similar work. Vendors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Each Quoter shall submit, in writing, information on past performance (10 page limit). Quoters shall provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  In addition, the Quoter is required to send Attachment 02, Past Performance Questionnaire, to those government and commercial activities provided by the Quoter in their submission.  The information shall be completed by the references who will then forward the completed questionnaires to the following:</p>
<p>James Rall<br /> james.rall@noaa.gov (Cc andrew.hildebrandt@noaa.gov) <br /> U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA/ERAD</p>
<p>The Government will not accept Questionnaires directly from the Quoter.  Only Questionnaires submitted on time and from the Quoter's references will be accepted.</p>
<p>The Government will conduct a past performance evaluation based upon the past performance of the vendor as it relates to the probability of vendor to provide the Government with quality service as covered within the solicitation.</p>
<p>Quoters are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS); Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) reports, the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity System (FAPIIS), or past performance information from any source.</p>
<p>The burden of providing thorough, complete, and demonstrated relevant past performance information rests with the Quoter.  Any Past Performance Questionnaire(s) received at the Government office designated herein after the exact time specified for receipt of past performance information is "late" and may not be considered for evaluation.  If the Quoter possess no relevant past performance, it should affirmatively state so in the quote.</p>
<p>Quotes lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance. A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the submission with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous submission to the Government when compared to the submissions of other Quoters having a satisfactory (or better) past performance.</p>
<p>b.	Technical: Each Quoter shall submit a technical submission (10 page limit). The technical submission should be sufficiently specific, detailed and complete so as to clearly and fully demonstrate that the Quoter has a thorough understanding of the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW) and has the ability to perform the work.  Quotes which merely state that requirements are understood and will be complied with, which paraphrase the specification document, the SOW or parts thereof, or use phrases such as "standard consulting practices will be employed", or "well established techniques will be employed", etc., may be considered unacceptable.  The technical submission shall include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>i.	Proof of ability to obtain $100K liability insurance in State of Florida.</p>
<p>ii.	Demonstrate experience and availability of trained technicians/staff.</p>
<p>iii.	Ability to obtain access to Federal facility.</p>
<p>c.	Price: The Quoter shall submit all information required for the line items included within this solicitation.  The quoted prices for the line items will be added together and used for evaluation purposes to determine the best value to the government over the base year, inclusive with each subsequent option year, over the life of the contract. The quoted prices will also be used to determine reasonableness.<br /> <br />52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. (Jan 2017)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following non-price factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>&bull;	Past Performance <br />&bull;	Technical</p>
<p>Past Performance is the most important factor.  Past Performance and Technical, when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, the Government will not award at significantly higher prices to only achieve slightly better performance. The Government will assess the benefits or better performance versus the added price through trade-off analysis. As non-price factors become equal-price becomes increasingly important.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding purchase order without further action by either party.  Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) terminate the contract for default.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</span></p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. Some of these USPSCs serve on intermittent contracts and are referred to in OTI as "bullpenners," providing support in a surge capacity. Those serving in the bullpen must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.  There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES - Please see Attachment 2 to this solicitation for information on AAPD No. 18-02.</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 2</p>
<p>Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter 7. <br />USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR)</p>
<p>APPENDIX D - DIRECT USAID CONTRACTS WITH A U.S. CITIZEN OR A U.S. RESIDENT ALIEN FOR PERSONAL SERVICES ABROAD</p>
<p>GP 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES (MAY 2018) (Pursuant to class deviation #M/OAA-DEV-AIDAR-18-3c)</p>
<p>USAID will provide Medevac services to the contractor and authorized dependents, through the Department of State's Bureau for Medical Services (MED), similar to those provided to U.S. Government employees in accordance with 16 FAM 300 Medical Travel. Medevac costs include travel and per diem, but do not include medical care costs. To be covered by the Medevac program, the contractor and authorized dependents must obtain and maintain international health insurance coverage that includes overseas hospitalization, and must provide proof of such insurance to the contracting officer prior to relocation abroad.</p>

A response to timely emails will be returned detailing instructions for base access.<br /><br />QUESTIONS and ANSWERS:<br /><br />1.) In section 1.1.3 it requires mixing to be done in a facility that is at least 1100 square feet for 1-3 workers as stated in the Technical guide 17 Military Handbook-Design of Pest Management Facilities. Will we have a facility like this on base? <br /><br />ANSWER: There is not a facility that meets these requirements for the contractor's use, however there is an outdoor mixing basin/area located at the golf course that will be available for contractor's use.</p>
<p>2.) &nbsp;In order to mix the herbicide and insecticide inside the facility will it be big enough and have big enough doors to get the contractor's equipment (tractors, spray rigs) in and out? If not will we be able to mix in a "nurse" tank and deliver it to sprayer in field when spraying?<br /><br />ANSWER: Please see question #1.</p>
<p>3.) &nbsp;In section 1.2.1 it states we have 15 days to apply pre emergent but we are only allowed to work during non flying hours(section 3.8). <br /><br />a. What happens if it rains during the time we are supposed to be spraying on the weekend? Will that window of time be extended?<br /><br />ANSWER: The 15 day window is an approximate time of pre-emergent application for maximum effectiveness for this area. This window can move forwards or backwards depending on weather conditions.<br /><br />b.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, is seeking proposals in regards to a Prototype Project Opportunity Notice (PPON) for Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW).<br /><br />The NGSW PPON details how the Government intends to award up to three prototype Other Transaction Agreements (OTAs) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2371b, with each COMPANY developing two weapon variants under the NGSW program and 6.8 millimeter ammunition common to both weapons. The weapons include the Next Generation Squad Weapon-Rifle (NGSW-R) and the Next Generation Squad Weapon-Automatic Rifle (NGSW-AR). The NGSW-R is the planned replacement for the M4/M4A1 Carbine and the NGSW-AR is the planned replacement for the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) in the Automatic Rifleman Role in the Close Combat Force.<br /><br />Deliverables for each prototype OTA include 53 NGSW-R weapons, 43 NGSW-AR weapons, 845,000 rounds of ammunition, spare parts, test barrels, tools/gauges/accessories, engineering support, and iterative prototyping efforts as defined in the Statement of Work. Each prototype OTA will undergo two prototype test events including Soldier Touch Points. The duration for each prototype OTA is estimated to be up to eight years. The first 27 months will be for prototyping the NGSW-R, NGSW-AR, and ammunition. Following this prototyping effort, there may be additional iterative prototyping efforts for the NGSW-R, NGSW-AR, and ammunition. These iterative prototyping efforts will each have separate durations and will occur within the eight year duration.<br /><br />In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2371b(f), and upon a determination that the prototype project (or any subsequent iterative prototyping efforts) was successfully completed under the competitively awarded OTA(s), a follow-on production contract(s) or OTA(s) may be awarded without the use of competitive procedures.<br /><br />The follow-on production award(s) is planned to be an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based contract with Firm Fixed Price Delivery Orders up to ten years or a fixed amount OTA up to ten years. The production award(s) may include 250,000 total weapons system(s) (NGSW-R, NGSW-AR, or both), 150,000,000 rounds of ammunition, spare parts, tools/gauges/accessories, and engineering support.

The track system shall be designed with the capability to extend the tracks outside of the cabinet to allow operators to place aircraft components onto an external cart. A cart mounted turntable system with tracks shall be included for each of the four medium cabinets.</p>
<p>Question 2. CFM calculations yield 650-815 CFM.... Do you have static pressure required?</p>
<p>See para 3.1.1.4 in the solicitation statement of work, the details will impact your duct size and pressure which I assume will vary with each offeror:</p>
<p>3.1.1.4 The blast booths shall meet the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist (ACGIH) recommendations for ventilation and noise expo exposure (Figure VS-80-02). The data is listed in the ACGIH's "Industrial Ventilation, A Manual of Recommended Practice for Design, 26th Edition". ACGIH's Figure VS-80-02 is provided in the appendix of this SOW. The requirements detailed in Figure VS-80-02 are also listed below:<br />3.1.1.4.1 All duct velocities shall have minimum 4000 fpm (20m/s).<br />3.1.1.4.2 All openings shall have a minimum of 500 fpm (2.5m/s) inward velocity<br />3.1.1.4.3 All cabinets shall have a minimum of 20 air changes per minute.<br />3.1.1.5 All units must be capable of operating with 460 Volt, 3 Phase, and 60 Hz electrical supply.</p>

<p>Question 15 (19 Mar 19). Clarify 3.1.2.6 how long of a time delay is required - generally by the time the operator stops blasting, put the part and the nozzle down, removes their arms from the gloves - this would be approximately 7- 10 seconds - 20 air exchanges per minute would be 1 exchange every 3 seconds, is a time delay really needed?</p>

<p>Questions and Answers from 14-Mar-2019</p>
<p>Question 1 (14 Mar 19). Exception 3.1.2.1 our standard blast cabinet is 14 gauge, note- the wear areas are protected by rubber curtains.</p>
<p>UPDATED Response: 3.1.2.1 The blast cabinets shall be a minimum 12 gauge steel all welded and formed construction with double wall sound insulation and heavy duty grating. The seals shall be of sufficient quality material to ensure leak-proof operation including at the window, gloves and glove connection ensemble, and doors.</p>
<p>2. 3.1.3.1 is normally used specifically for plastic media 60 degree cone</p>
<p>Response 3.1.3.1. ----- The 60 degree bottom cone design may vary based on the type of media to be used such as glass bead and aluminum oxide.</p>
<p>Question 3 (14 Mar 19). Having both doors open on the blast cabinet for purposes of layout on the medium blast booths would be <br />(42+60+42 42+60+42 42+60+42 42+60+42 = 48 ft would not fit in allotted space of 43'-2"</p>
<p>UPDATED Response: 3.2.1.3. The total system footprint (including cabinet, reclaimer, and dust collector) for all four medium cabinets operating side by side shall fit in an area of 43ft 2in W x 10ft 2in D x 10ft H. This can include a shared track design for two blast cabinets (with a gap between the two tracks allowing operators to move around the track) and doors that overlap. Not all eight doors will be opened at the same time. This area shall include a 3ft safety clearance distance for all electrical panels, maintenance locations, waste removal path, and access points. All maintenance panels and chamber doors shall be able to be opened a full 90 degrees once installed at the final place of operation. The proposed operation orientation to adhere to these dimensions shall be included with the equipment drawings submitted for para 3.1.1.14 as part of the proposal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Question 1 (25 Mar 19): It is stated that the equipment must be ISO-9001:2015 certified. Since ISO-9001 is only one quality management system, this requirement severely limits the contracting team's ability to receive competitive proposals because it rules out any organizations that operate under other quality management systems. Will the contracting team consider removing this requirement from the solicitation?</p>
<p>UPDATED Response 1: 3.1.1.15.1 The nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories (NRTLs) or the IOS9001:2015 certification shall be met for all blast systems provided, see para 3.4.4.</p>
<p>Question 2 (25 Mar 19): As a follow up question. If removing that requirement will not be considered, will the contracting team consider allowing for an NRTL certification on all provided machines in lieu of the ISO9001:2015 documentation? The 3rd party NRTL certification requirement would hold manufacturers to a higher standard than the ISO-9001:2015 requirements and would enable organizations with other quality management systems to bid on the project. This would greatly increase the contracting team's ability to receive competitive proposals.</p>
<p>UPDATED Response 2 3.1.1.15.1 The nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories (NRTLs) or the IOS9001:2015 certification shall be met for all blast systems provided, see para 3.4.4.</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(c)
(1)
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to—
(A) Change the name in the SAM database;

In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor.

(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an “I agree” click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., “click-wrap” or “browse-wrap” agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officer’s decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractor’s specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

These measures may be addressed in a system security plan.
 
      (c)  Cyber incident reporting requirement.
 
            (1)  When the Contractor discovers a cyber incident that affects a covered contractor information system or the covered defense information residing therein, or that affects the contractor’s ability to perform the requirements of the contract that are designated as operationally critical support and identified in the contract, the Contractor shall—
 
                    (i)  Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense information, including, but not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data, and user accounts. This review shall also include analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as well as other information systems on the Contractor’s network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised covered defense information, or that affect the Contractor’s ability to provide operationally critical support; and
 
                    (ii)  Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil.
 
            (2)  Cyber incident report. The cyber incident report shall be treated as information created by or for DoD and shall include, at a minimum, the required elements at http://dibnet.dod.mil.
 
            (3)  Medium assurance certificate requirement. In order to report cyber incidents in accordance with this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall have or acquire a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate to report cyber incidents. For information on obtaining a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate, see http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/Pages/index.aspx.
 
      (d)  Malicious software. When the Contractor or subcontractors discover and isolate malicious software in connection with a reported cyber incident, submit the malicious software to DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) in accordance with instructions provided by DC3 or the Contracting Officer. Do not send the malicious software to the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>(e)  Media preservation and protection. When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest.
 
      (f)  Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis.
 
      (g)  Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.
 
      (h)  DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent practicable, the Contractor shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.<BR><BR>i)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is not created by or for DoD is authorized to be released outside of DoD—
 
            (1)  To entities with missions that may be affected by such information;
 
            (2)  To entities that may be called upon to assist in the diagnosis, detection, or mitigation of cyber incidents;

            (4)  For national security purposes, including cyber situational awareness and defense purposes (including with Defense Industrial Base (DIB) participants in the program at 32 CFR part 236); or
 
            (5)  To a support services contractor (“recipient”) that is directly supporting Government activities under a contract that includes the clause at 252.204-7009, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information.
 
      (j)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is created by or for DoD (including the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause) is authorized to be used and released outside of DoD for purposes and activities authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause, and for any other lawful Government purpose or activity, subject to all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy based restrictions on the Government’s use and release of such information.
 
      (k)  The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data.<BR><BR>(l)  Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractor’s responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.
 
      (m)  Subcontracts. The Contractor shall—
 
            (1)  Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and
 
            (2)  Require subcontractors to—
 
                    (i)  Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and
 
                    (ii)  Provide the incident report number, automatically assigned by DoD, to the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) as soon as practicable, when reporting a cyber incident to DoD as required in paragraph (c) of this clause.<BR><BR>(a)Definitions. As used in this clause -

Computer software means computer programs, source code, source code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae, and related material that would enable the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled.

Contractor will install a 3'x3'x 6' concrete step pad centered under the gate to allow for full swing of the gate in the open position.</p>
<p><br />E. Relevant Standards:</p>
<p>Contractor will adhere to all relevant standards found in UFC 4-022-03, Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC), Security Fences and Gates.</p>
<p>F. Site Visit:</p>
<p>A Site Visit is not required.&nbsp; Vendors may go and evaluate the site on their own without requiring access to the installation.&nbsp; Vendors shall send an email to michael.w.boyd2.mil@mail.mil at least 2 business days prior to the intended site visit date stating their intention to do so, so that 258th personnel may be given notification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />SUBMITTALS:</p>
<p>Submittals shall include a Form AF 3000, Material Approval Submittal Form.  The submittal must include a minimum of three copies of the required information.  Submittals for Approval will have two copies of the required information retained by the Government and the third copy returned with the AF3000 noting disposition of the submittal.  Close out Submittals shall have all copies of the required information retained by the Government.</p>
<p>Q&amp;A's:</p>
<p>Q1. Does the existing  sliding gate operator currently run off of a 3 phase, 230 volt motor?</p>
<p>A1. Current Gate Operator is 1 H.P., 230/3 phase</p>
<p><br />Q2. As to the requested 8' x 36' sliding gate, is the actual gate opening 36 feet?</p>
<p>A2. Gate opening from post to post is 26'</p>
<p><br />Q3. Is it possible to get pictures of the current sliding gate and personnel gate?</p>
<p>A3. Please see attached pictures or email michael.w.boyd2.mil@mail.mil for pictures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q4. The scope of work does not mention a means of access for the sliding gate. Image 2266 that is posted shows the keypad on the inside of the gate but nothing is pictured in any of the posted pictures for the exterior of the sliding gate</p>
<p>A4.&nbsp;Keypads are mounted at the entrance and exit of the gate. There is also a phone on the entrance side to call the entry control point for access.</p>
<p><br />Q5. Under the section entitled Modify Personnel Gate please clarify the end result; that you want new gate posts, the gate reduced in height from 8 foot to 6 foot with a fixed section of fence above the gate with a panic bar. Do you need a keyed entrance on the exterior of the panic bar?</p>
<p>A5. Standard 3'x7' gates with a 1' transom is the industry standard and needed at both man gate locations. The existing man gate is mounted on an aluminum post. Replacing those posts with galvanized steel will provide additional strength to support the gate and transom weight. The additional gate is new construction and be similar in size and strength to the upgrades made at the existing gate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keyed entrance for the personnel gate adjacent to the sliding gate would be preferred. The additional gate does not need to be keyed. If possible, the lock set should be from the Stanley Best company to match the key program already in place. Core codes will be provided to Best Locks by the 171st facility manager.</p>
<p><br />Q6. Based upon our industry experience we are requesting that you modify the specifications concerning both personnel gates and the gate posts.<br /> You will obtain a better fit and more efficient operation of the panic bars if you specify square gate posts and square gate frames for both gates.<br /> You will also need to specify self closing hinges for the personnel gates.<br /> We also usually cover all openings within 2 feet on each side of the gate as well as the entire gate with a custom mesh or aluminum plate when panic bars are required.</p>
<p>A6. Square gate posts are acceptable as industry standard and provide the best results as stated above. In addition, it provides additional protection from unauthorized entry by limiting the amount of space that a device could be used to activate the panic hardware.&nbsp; Self-closing hinges must be installed.&nbsp; Defeating an unauthorized breech from the outside is critical. All openings MUST be protected in a way that provides the most effective deterrent.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Q7. The transom is a fixed section of fence above the gate-is this what you are seeking? if so, then the gates will be 6 foot high by the width required.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>A7. Standard 3'x7' gates w/1' transom are required</p>
<p><br />Q8. Please clarify the size of the concrete step pad as 3 foot by 3 foot by 6 inches thick.</p>
<p>A8. Concrete pad should be 3' wide by 6' long by 4" deep. Over excavate the area by 4" to provide for a crushed limestone bed and install 6"x6" wire mesh.  3' should extend on the outward swing of the gate and 3' on the inside of the gate. This will provide a solid surface that will be unaffected by erosion or growth of vegetation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q9. We just learned from the gate operator manufacturer that the newest model of the Linear GSLG-A gate operator is still belt driven with the chain as pictured in posted Image 2271.</p>
<p>Please confirm that this is acceptable as the industry now using chain driven only gate operators as the latest generation.</p>
<p>A9.&nbsp; **Regardless of make or model, an all-chain drive (no belt drive) model is required**.&nbsp;&nbsp;The voltage requirements of the operator are 230 volt, 3 phase. Horsepower needed is 1HP.</p>

<div><br /></div>
(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /> <br />(ii) The solicitation number is 75N95019Q00077 and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) on a Full and Open competitive basis.
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items and is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $250,000.00.  A Fixed-Price type of contract is contemplated for any resulting contract entered into as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) Number/Effective Date: 2019-01 / 01-22-2019.</p>
<p>(iv) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with size standard 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>(v) Background<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.  The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center whose mission is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.</p>
<p>At the NCATS Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), there is a significant effort towards automation in chemistry to minimize repetitive manual steps, particularly in preparative purification. Chemists currently utilize flash silica gel chromatography systems. However, medicinal chemists at NCATS do not have access to mass directed purification in either normal or reverse phase purification systems; this forces a tedious manual LCMS analysis of fractions. Bench chemists also do not have access to automated sequential reverse phase purification of multiple samples. In order to prepare for the ramp up in automation, NCATS has a requirement for two (2) Chromatography System Mass Spectrometer systems, integrated to the mass spectrometer which can collect fractions simultaneously using PDA, ELSD and MS, on a Brand-Name-or-Equal basis, meeting or exceeding the performance characteristics, of the subject Mass Spec system described in this notice. Enabling the automated purification of samples with a wide range of polarity and analytical properties will significantly impact the work flow of all chemists within the NCGC chemistry labs at NCATS.</p>

<DESC><p>Amendment 0001:<br />Question 1: How is it possible to have a 24 inch travel stage (Z axis) inside a 24"x24"x24" vacuum chamber? Are these requirements and/or chamber dimensions correct?</p>
<p>Answer 1: The internal dimensions of the vacuum chamber are correct (i.e. 24"x24"x24"). Since the height of the chamber is 24", a travel distance of 24" was selected. It is true that with a mounted XY stage on top of the Z stage the travel distance (Z) will be less than 24", because the XY stage (and things on top of the stage like the samples, a heater, a plate, etc.) all occupy some height. Thus while in operation, the Z stage will realistically only travel maybe 15-21"; however, some extra material/length and flexibility is anticipated to be required by the Government.</p>

<DESC>PURPOSE:<br />The Army Medical Modeling and Simulation Industry Day is a focused opportunity for vendors in the medical modeling and simulation community to convey their capabilities to the Government medical simulation community of interest and for Government to convey organizational description and interests, needs, alignment and future expectations to the industry community of interest. The Government is seeking vendors who have the capability to demonstrate Medical Modeling, Medical Training Aids, Medical Simulators and Medical Simulations in areas including but not limited to:
<p>&bull; Standardized Patients<br />&bull; Medical Gaming<br />&bull; Interactive Multi-media instruction<br />&bull; Prolonged Field Care training<br />&bull; Clinical/Trauma Manikins<br />&bull; Canine simulators<br />&bull; Obstetrical , Pediatric, Orthopedics Simulations<br />&bull; Moulage Capabilities<br />&bull; Human Worn Surgical Cut Suit</p>
<p>The intent of this day is two phased.</p>
<p>The first phase in the morning is for medical representatives from the Army Medical Department (AMEDD) Center and School including the Directorate of Simulation and Capabilities Development Integration Directorate (CDID), Army Futures Command, Assistant Secretary of the Army, Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA/ALT) and Defense Health Agency's Joint Project Manager Medical Modeling and Simulation (JPM MMS) to provide information briefs in a classroom setting.</p>
<p>The second phase in the afternoon is for vendors to provide demonstrations and hands on displays of their capabilities to the Government briefers. Space is limited, therefore a pre-selection of vendors may be necessary. Vendors will submit their intended display and information brief outline via form to follow. Government will review submissions, and in the event of more applicants than space, will decide which displays and vendors. Emphasis is on existing medical modeling and simulation capability, but conceptual products or services may also be demonstrated as long as they are post Research and Development phase. To ensure sufficient and equal interface with Government, vendors will be set up, and the Government will rotate to each vendor in equal time increments. Government will notify all vendors of the interface period length ahead of the day.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION:<br />Please complete the attached vendor information agreement and submit to angie.t.kalsi.ctr@mail.mil NLT 1 May 2019. Logistical details will be provided upon selection to participate.</p>

With condsideration of time constraints for proposal submission, this document has been amended to capture "Yes" or "No" responses to the individual requirements, rather than serve as a map of an offeror's technical proposal.     

If you are having trouble viewing the attachments, please open this announcement directly from the FAACO or FBO website. It has been reported to the FAA buyer that the updated announcement link in the auto-notification email sometimes  omits new attachments.

<p>Following your proposal submission and our review, the Contracting Officer may seek more information. In accordance with FAR 15.306(a)(3) and FAR 52.215-1, we advise you that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions (except clarifications).

<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;"> 
<hr style="color: #343a40;" size="0" />
</span></div>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="background: white;">The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO), Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operation (OMAO), using the procedures set forth in FAR Part 13, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Applanix Corporation located at 85 Leek Cres, Richmond Hill, ON L4B 3B3, Canada, for a firm-fixed price contract for upgrades to proprietary government owned equipment. Applanix Corporation is the only known business that meets the requirements and specifications to manufacture Inertial Measuring Units (IMU) for Applanix Corporation POS/MV-320 V-5 equipment. THE PARTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE PLUG AND PLAY AND NO MODIFICATIONS TO THE EXISTING EQUIPMENT ARE PERMITTED. Applanix Corporation is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and sole firm that owns the POS/MV-320 V-5 designs (proprietary) and therefore has the ability to manufacture them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="background: white;">The following will be procured:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: white;">6 Inertial Measuring Units / 6 IMU Adapter Plates / 6 IMU Adapter Cables</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">NOAA&rsquo;s Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) manages and operates a fleet of 16 Oceanographic Survey ships and 4 regional port offices to support ship operations and maintenance. The shipboard Multibeam Echo Sounders and other mission systems and equipment installed on these ships use precise positioning data (location, orientation, heave, pitch and roll) that is collected, derived and distributed by Applanix POS/MV-320 systems to accurately record collected acoustic data during Hydrographic Charting missions, Hydrographic Mapping missions and Fisheries Acoustic Survey missions. The government intends to replace the currently installed obsolete LN200 type IMU&rsquo;s with new technology type 2/7/36 IMU&rsquo;s that will ensure continued collection of highly accurate precise vessel position and orientation data and continued system performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In order to maintain the functionality of this system, NOAA is looking for the OEM to provide the required upgrades.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="background: white;">The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing.</span> <span style="background: white;">This notice does not constitute a solicitation, Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or an Invitation for Bid (IFB) and it does not restrict the Government in any way regarding its ultimate acquisition approach. </span>However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required services. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Contract Specialist Bridget Cofo at bridget.cofo@noaa.gov by 2:00 PM EST on April 22, 2019.</p>

All questions related to this BAA shall be submitted to indiarco@usaid.gov.</strong></span></div>
<div><br /></div>

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is issuing this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to seek participants to co-create, co-design, co-invest, and collaborate on research and development interventions to rapidly demonstrate and rigorously test person-centered, high-impact and novel solutions that can accelerate the Government of India's (GOI) efforts to eliminate Tuberculosis (TB) by 2025. USAID invites organizations and companies to submit an Expression of Interest, as provided below.
<p>Achieving the ambitious goal of ending TB by 2025 necessitates a paradigm shift in approach and strategy. Partnering with the GOI, USAID is calling for groundbreaking approaches to accelerate a reduction in TB, with a special focus on multidrug-resistant/rifampicin resistant TB MDR/RR-TB. USAID will invest in out-of-the-box, but achievable solutions that leapfrog conventional approaches to ensure a person-centered approach to prevent, diagnose and treat TB. USAID is particularly interested in investing in and supporting approaches that strengthen the enabling environment, enhance service delivery platforms and integrate the latest behavior change approaches with scientific and/or technological advances for maximum impact. Critical to the sustained success of the high-impact solutions is a defined understanding and pathway of how to ensure that TB services are accessible for all, including priority and vulnerable populations, and fostering diverse local partnerships that can help catalyze successful implementation.</p>
<p>The intent of the BAA is to allow co-creation and co-design to the maximum extent to create high quality, effective partnerships with great efficiency in time and resources. USAID will invite selected for-profit and non-profit, faith-based, public and private organizations, as detailed below, to co-create solutions to the Problem and Challenge Statements stated in this BAA, including those organizations that have ideas, expertise, resources, and/or funding to add to potential solutions.</p>
<p>Co-Investing: USAID wants to align goals with the partners under this BAA, to facilitate shared responsibility, shared risk, and shared resourcing. Shared resourcing requires that cash and other resources, both tangible and intangible, such as in-kind contributions, expertise, intellectual property, brand value, high-value coordination, and access to key people, places, and information, are directed towards reaching the solution to the Problem/Challenge. Co-investing does not require equal shared resources (such as 1:1 leverage), but rather resource contributions that are appropriate to the specific project's objectives, considering the comparative advantages brought by the participation of each party.</p>

<DESC>This increase in shared-capacity is necessary to address requirements that were not anticipated at the time of the initial contract solicitation. The unexpected rise in mission requirements, such as hurricane recovery work at Tyndall AFB, necessitate a AE SATOC suite that can quickly respond to these requirements. With additional capacity, the current AE SATOC suite is capable of providing the necessary support with little or no delay or duplication of costs attendant to establishing a new suite of AE contracts. Concurrent with this action, the District is working to establish a $475M AE MATOC to facilitate requirements beyond these immediate needs.

<DESC><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> The Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is issuing this&nbsp;Invitation for Bid (IFB) solicitation for Mooring Cell Construction at Tennessee River Mile 303.5 and 303.6 near Decatur, AL.&nbsp;
<p>The plans and technical specifications for this requirement are attached as separate document but intended to be a part of this solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:</strong> USACE anticipates a base with one (1) option; firm fixed-price construction contract to accomplish the following work at Tennessee River Mile 303.5 and 303.6:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Access by water.</strong> Most work will be located at Tennessee River Mile (TRM) 303.5 and 303.6 immediately upstream of the dam. The only access to provide equipment and materials to this worksite will be by water.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Mooring Cell #1 (TRM 303.6) Construction.</strong> The new cell diameter and height are indicated on the drawing set which will be included with the solicitation on FBO. The cell shall be placed in the footprint of the current cell. There is approximately 10-20 feet of water and 10-20 feet of overburden until expected refusal. The number of NEW sheet piles is listed in the drawing set. A tremie concrete seal shall be developed prior to aggregate placement. Dimensions and elevations are indicated by the drawing set. Any excess sheet piles once the mooring cell has been fully constructed shall be property of the Contractor. After the sheet piles have all been driven a diver must inspect the sheet piles for any interlock concerns. An inspection shall be made of each cell location within the TRM 303 locations. A concrete seal shall then be placed above the overburden. Once the concrete has adequately cured, the remaining height of the cell shall be filled with aggregate.</p>
<p><strong>OPTIONS:</strong></p>

<p>Description of Work (physical characteristics):</p>
<p>OVERVIEW: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Seattle District, requires replacement of an existing CO2 Fire Suppression System with a water mist system and modernization of an existing CO2 Fire Suppression System at Chief Joseph Dam, WA. Project work area access is restricted by the adjacency of the Powerhouse and the dam, and restrictions on the use of cranes, lifts and other equipment in the proximity of energized overhead transmission lines, transformers and transformer bus lines.</p>
<p>DEMOLITION/DECONSTRUCTION: Removal of the existing CO2 system in the Oil Storage Room, Oil Purification Room, Station Service Transformer Vault, Main Generating Units and Station Service Units at Chief Joseph Dam, WA. This includes but is not limited to the mechanical piping and the electrical features as well as the CO2 bottles themselves. The firing heads on the CO2 bottles, however, shall remain the property of the Government.</p>
<p>FIRE PROTECTION &amp; ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION: Modernize existing high-pressure CO2 systems and replace with a new water mist fire protection system. The existing CO2 systems in the Oil Storage Room, Oil Purification Room, and Station Service Transformer Vault will be replaced with water mist to improve safety and reduce maintenance requirements due to CO2. The CO2 systems within the main units and station service unit's generator housings will remain in place, but will be modernized to bring these systems in conformance with current NFPA code requirements.</p>
<p>The magnitude of construction is estimated to be between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The resulting contract will be firm-fixed-price.</p>

<DESC>This project is an emergency repair for the 6" natural gas main and valve. The gas main will be temporarily isolated and a new section of 6" steel pipe and valve will be installed to facilitate repairs.&nbsp; The work is expected to take approximately 12 hours.<br />This is a high pressure 6" steel natural gas main and valve with mechanical connections that are now obsolete.&nbsp; This line&nbsp; branches off of the base natural gas system and is currently leaking to atmosphere.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no isolation valves before the leak except the single valve that is at the start of our natural gas system as it enters Schriever AFB.&nbsp; This would require a prolonged shutdown of the entire natural gas system to Schriever AFB.<br />(A) We have contacted multiple contractors including Olson Plumbing and Tap Masters and they have neither the resources, materials or the technical knowledge to perform this urgent repair.&nbsp; <br />(B) Black Hills Energy is our natural gas utility provider and as such, they have the technical expertise to complete this repair and&nbsp; they already have all of the tools, equipment and resources in place to make this repair.&nbsp; This repair needs to be completed as soon as possible to not only save on the expenditure of natural gas loss but it represents a significant safety hazard.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>SAT)


Acquisition Plan Action ID:  36C245-19-AP-1373

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 5 (NCO), 849 International Drive, Linthicum, MD 21090.  

Organization Activity:  Department of Veterans affairs, Washington DC VA Medical Center, 50 Irving Street, NW, Washington. DC 20422.

2237 Number:  688-19-2-978-0051

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
Award of an annual service contract for maintenance and service of Storz hardware products at the Washington DC VA Medical Center.

Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:  

The Washington DC VA Medical Center relies on Storz products for surgical operations and procedures. Renewing the service contract with Storz covers services, repairs, exchanges, parts, and maintenance on both hardware. The service contract ensures the Washington DC VA Medical Center is able to use the products to its full capabilities and to maintain and optimize the uptime of the products. As the OEM of this equipment, Storz provides the unique capability to service their equipment and provide proprietary software support. Estimated dollar value is $662,520.00.
Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

 ( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 (  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
 (  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
         or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
 (  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

Karl Storz is uniquely qualified to provide training, parts, and other resources to support this system and repair these instruments. Their repairs are certified by the manufacturer so that they can be reprocessed per manufacturer s requirements. They have the training and resources to respond quickly to the Medical Center s needs and no other party will have equivalent access to OEM parts and knowledge. No other party will be able to provide software updates. 

Additionally, the current contract for these services expires on April 30, 2019. If this contract is not renewed, the Medical Center will have to pay for each scope repair, exchange, and related parts/labor costs. This will put a significant strain on resources within Biomedical Engineering and the OR, making it incredibly difficult to support this system and other systems in the OR. The instrumentation is frequently damaged and is costly to repair without a service contract. This will impact turnaround times for equipment and may ultimately impact ability to perform surgical cases.

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Storz is uniquely able to repair the instrumentation and scopes as they are the OEM for the equipment using all OEM parts. Market research found that there are numerous 3rd party companies that can repair rigid and flexible scopes, but there are not companies that can provide the range of services and repairs that are encompassed within the scope of work.

Determination by the CO that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:

Historical data for the same services performed from May 1, 2018 through April 30, 2019.  Market research conducted on FBO and FPDS-NG. Also, a Request for Proposal (RFI) will be posted to GSA and FBO.

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:
 
As described in Section 6 above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties.

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:

Storz is uniquely able to repair the instrumentation and scopes as they are the OEM for the equipment using all OEM parts. Market research found that there are numerous 3rd party companies that can repair rigid and flexible scopes, but there are not companies that can provide the range of services and repairs that are encompassed within the scope of work.

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

None at this point in time.

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

There are no barriers to competition that may be removed at this time.    

Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
