<DESC>Under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1, the VISN 19 Rocky Mountain 
Consolidated Contracting Center, Denver, CO, proposes to enter into a non-competitive 
commercial items contract with an specific individual who resides in Denver Metro Area in Colorado.
The Eastern Colorado Health Care System (ECHCS), Research Services at the Department of 
Veteran Affairs, in Denver Colorado has a requirement for an individual to provide research
study design and data analysis for several research projects, including Patient-Centered 
Disease Management, Medication Adherence and the Optimal Use and Cost Effectiveness of ICD's
in the VA Health Care System.
The goal of the Medication Adherence study is to reduce re-hospitalization for heart
 troubles and deaths of veterans following heart attack hospitalization and to test 
whether the multi-faceted patient-centered adherence intervention is effective in 
improving adherence to heart medications and achieving blood pressure (BP) 
and LDL-cholesterol goals among veterans following heart attack hospitalization. 
The intervention will adapt elements of prior successfully adherence interventions, 
including: collaborative care (between pharmacists, primary care providers, and cardiologists), 
patient education (tailored to patient needs and provided on a regular ongoing basis), 
tailoring of medication regimens (i.e., use of pill boxes, simplification of dosing, 
synchronization of refill dates), and tele-monitoring via interactive voice response (IVR)
technology. Therefore this study requires an assistant who is experienced in medical
terminology and patient care. Given the individual's experience as a First Responder, 
he has expertise in both medical terminology and patient care. 

Given the unique issues with these studies (complex cohorts that are difficult to enroll, 
follow-up and analyze), the VA requires a data analyst assistant with strong comprehension 
in randomized controlled trials, retrospective cohort and prospective cohort study design. 
Additionally, we require statistical knowledge in power analysis, logistic regression, longitudinal 
databases and Poisson regression.  The individual is a unique candidate because he is 
actively working toward on a Master's degree in both Epidemiology (emphasis in study design)
and Biostatistics at the Colorado School of Public Health.  Additionally, because of  
additional experience as a First Responder, he has a strong background in medical
terminology and patient care. Finally, the individual has experience working with cross-disciplinary 
teams and working on multiple projects contemporaneously. Overall, this individual's previous
experience and current educational pursuits give him the unique qualities necessary to implement
the multi-faceted requirements of these studies. 
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within the due date for receipt of proposals will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be 
considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

JUSTIFICATION
1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.
The Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 1055 Clermont Street, Denver, CO 80220
Rocky Mountain Consolidated Contracting Center, VISN 19, 4100 East Mississippi Ave, Glendale, CO 80246
2.  Nature/description of action.
This activity proposes to solicit sole source with Evan Carey to provide research study design and data analysis for several research projects, including Patient-Centered Disease Management, Medication Adherence and the Optimal Use and Cost Effectiveness of ICD's  in the VA Health Care System.

To provide analysis and research design to support the above research projects directed by Dr. John Rumsfeld, Dr. Michael Ho and Dr. Paul Varosy.
The Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center
1055 Clermont Street
 Denver, CO 80220
Quote:  $20/hr
Estimated Price = $25,000 ($20/hr)
4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1.
5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.
Patient-Centered Disease Management (PCDM) is a multicenter randomized trial of patient-centered CHF disease management that includes case-finding, a collaborative care intervention with telemonitoring, and evidence-based CHF and depression management. The study is designed as an 'effectiveness' intervention to enhance broad implementation. PCDM specifically targets the enrollment of some of the most complex VA outpatients, in order to evaluate a novel collaborative care intervention aimed at improving their quality of care and quality of life.  More specifically, this study enrolls patients with heart failure who have moderate to severe decrements in their health status (i.e. heavy symptom burden, functional limitations, poor quality of life) as well as medical and/or psychiatric co-morbitities (50% of the enrolled patients have moderate to severe depressive symptoms). This is traditionally an extremely difficult patient population to care for; they often, "fall through the cracks", or bounce between primary care and specialists; thereby requiring a research assistant who is qualified in complex study designs and patient follow-up. 
The Optimal Use and Cost Effectiveness of ICD's In the VA Health Care System trial is to determine the incidence and predictors of "appropriate discharges" of ICD, predict mortality despite the presence of ICD, and assess cost-effectiveness of ICD's leading to development of clinical guidelines and healthcare policy of ICD therapy both within and outside the VAHCS. Therefore, this study requires an assistant who is proficient in SAS and R and knowledgeable in longitudinal data analysis.  
The goal of the Medication Adherence study is to reduce re-hospitalization for heart troubles and deaths of veterans following heart attack hospitalization and to test whether the multi-faceted patient-centered adherence intervention is effective in improving adherence to heart medications and achieving blood pressure (BP) and LDL-cholesterol goals among veterans following heart attack hospitalization. The intervention will adapt elements of prior successfully adherence interventions, including: collaborative care (between pharmacists, primary care providers, and cardiologists), patient education (tailored to patient needs and provided on a regular ongoing basis), tailoring of medication regimens (i.e., use of pill boxes, simplification of dosing, synchronization of refill dates), and tele-monitoring via interactive voice response (IVR) technology. Therefore this study requires an assistant who is experienced in medical terminology and patient care. Given Evan's experience as a First Responder, he has expertise in both medical terminology and patient care. 
Given the unique issues with these studies (complex cohorts that are difficult to enroll, follow-up and analyze), they require a researcher with strong comprehension in randomized controlled trials, retrospective cohort and prospective cohort study design. Additionally, they require statistical knowledge in power analysis, logistic regression, longitudinal databases and Poisson regression. E. C.  is a unique candidate because he is actively working toward on a Master's degree in both Epidemiology (emphasis in study design) and Biostatistics at the Colorado School of Public Health.  Additionally, because of his experience as a First Responder, he has a strong background in medical terminology and patient care. Finally, Evan has experience working with cross-disciplinary teams and working on multiple projects contemporaneously. Overall, his previous experience and current educational pursuits give him the unique qualities necessary to implement the multi-faceted requirements of these studies. 
6.  Description of Efforts to Ensure Soliciting  of as Many Sources as Possible.
This acquisition will be posted on the FedBizOpps web site as a sole-source procurement. Questions concerning this procurement's qualification as a sole-source procurement can be raised by the public at that time. 
7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.
The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on the sole-source availability of this device.  The rate of $20/hr is considered a fair and reasonable cost for the proposed services rendered based on similar positions at the VA.
Also, the following GSA schedule 736.1 (TAPS) does not have less competitive rates for word processors positions at $23.93 with Access Personnel Contract No.  GS-07F-0131V.  GSA Schedule 736.2 for ADP occupations are $77.82/hr for a data analyst at Data Systems Analyst Inc and Data Entry Operator at $25.70/hr at TBD communications and $23.83/hr at Skyline. Various SDVOSB - GSA schedules researched with Management Support Tech was $36.36/hr. and Ambit Junior analyst at $50.47/hr. TDB did not have direct comparable position for a Data Analyst, only the Data Entry Operator. 
8.  Description of Market Survey.
The $20 rate is the equivalent contract rate since no benefits are provided with contractors.
9.  Any Other Supporting Data.
There are no other factors supporting the use of other than full and open competition. 
   10.  Listing of Interested Sources.
Mr. EC 
Golden, CO  80403
11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.
As this is not a recurring acquisition, there are no actions that may be taken to overcome barriers to acquisition.   
12.  IT Security Requirements
The Certification and Authorization requirements do not apply. A Security Accreditation Package is not required.
The service doesn't involve the storage, generation, transmission, or exchange of VA sensitive information. However the following mechanism or documentation will ensure the protection of VA sensitive information: 
A.) Contractor's signature on contractor's Rules of Behavior Agreement and the Business Associate Agreement.
B.) Contractor will review security guidelines and other IT precautions as needed to perform duties.

 The following clause is in full text;  Contractor Access to Federally Controlled Facilities and/or Unclassified Sensitive Information or Unclassified IT Systems (May 2010)
Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors.  The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006  DOD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive  12 (HSPD-12) dated  November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DOD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12.  This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.  This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DOD computer/network, to perform certain unclassified both non-sensitive and sensitive duties.
  It is the responsibility of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. The requirement to control access to sensitive information applies to all US government IT systems and/or areas where unclassified but sensitive information may be discussed, displayed or maintained.  DON policy prescribes that all unclassified data that has not been approved for public release and is stored on mobile computing devises must be treated as sensitive data and encrypted using commercially available encryption technology. Whenever granted access to sensitive information, contractor employees shall follow applicable DOD/DON instructions, regulations, policies and procedures when reviewing, processing, producing, protecting, destroying and/or storing that information.
  Operational Security (OPSEC) procedures and practices must be implemented by both the contractor and contract employee to protect the product, information, services, operations and missions related to the contract. The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractors Security Representative.  Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the Navy Commands Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractors Security Representative.  The Contractors Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter.  The Contractors Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer.
 Non-Sensitive Positions Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements: Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the US (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DOD instruction) and Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint check prior to installation access. To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractors Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following: SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards Original Signed Release Statements.
  The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed NACI. The Contractors Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date. Sensitive Positions Contractor employee whose duties require accessing a DOD unclassified computer/network, working with sensitive unclassified information (either at a Government or contractor facility), or physical access to a DOD facility must be a US citizen and possess a favorable trustworthiness determination prior to installation access.
 To obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination, each contractor employee must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Local Credit Checks (NACLC) which consists of a NACI including a FBI fingerprint check plus credit and law enforcement checks. Each contractor employee applying for a trustworthiness determination is required to complete SF-85P Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards Original Signed Release Statements Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date. To maintain continuing authorization for an employee to access a DOD unclassified computer/network, and/or have access to sensitive unclassified information, the contractor shall ensure that the individual employee has a current requisite background investigation.
  The Contractors Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required and ensuring that background investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. IT Systems Access When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employees duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Commands Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individuals performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources.
  The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Commands Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date. When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractors Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required. Security Approval Process The Contractors Security Representative shall ensure that each individual employee pending assignment shall accurately complete the required forms for submission to the Navy Commands Security Manager.
  The Contractors Security Representative shall screen the investigative questionnaires for completeness and accuracy and for potential suitability/security issues prior to submitting the request to the Navy Commands Security Manager.  Forms and fingerprint cards may be obtained from the Navy Commands Security Manager. These required items, shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager for processing at least 30 days prior to the individual employees anticipated date for reporting for duty.  The Navy Commands Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy Commands Security Manager may render the contract employee ineligible for the assignment.
 A favorable review of the questionnaire and advance fingerprint results are required as an interim measure prior to the contract employee start date. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy Commands Security Manager is final and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. If contractor employees already possess a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the Navy Commands Security Manager will use the Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employees performance under the contract.
 The Navy Commands Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a position of trust determination.  When a favorable determination is not made, contractor employees shall not be permitted to work on this contract effort and if already working on the contract shall be removed immediately.  The potential consequences of any requirements under this clause including denial of access for a proposed contractor employee who fails to obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract.
  Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees for working in non-sensitive positions, with sensitive information, and/or on Government IT systems. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have physical access to a federally controlled facility and/or access to a federally-controlled information system/network and/or access to government information. All quotes shall include the requested items, with their unit prices, extended prices, and total price, FOB Point, a point of contact, name and telephone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, prompt payment terms. Quote over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.
 Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements. Responses to this solicitation are due by September 13, 2010 at 16:00 (4:00 PM).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Task Description - Ft Irwin METAR modification: Background:  Ft Irwin currently runs the Vaisala MetMan100/WebView software combination on a Windows PC to collect and display weather data from 16 Vaisala MAWS120 locations on the National Training Center. The USAF has requested that the software package be modified to produce standard METAR messages that could both be used locally and transmitted to AFWA.Task: Vaisala must modify an already existing package running in a different operating environment (Linux, Metman400) that currently takes data feeds from 20 USAF MAWS301sites in Korea, processes them in Vaisala's Tucson facility, and transmits METAR message to a secure FTP site from which AFWA pulls them. Description of product: The new component of the software package would run in parallel to the existingMetman100/Webview package currently in use at Ft Irwin. It would read data from the Metman data files, transform it into METAR messages, and transmit them to AFWA via a Secure FTP link similar to the one used from our Tucson facility. It is anticipated that the USAF would want the capability to view the METAR messages locally as well. At this time, there is no requirement to store the old METAR messages when they are replaced by more current messages. Anticipated Level of Effort: Vaisala anticipates that the software modification effort will take approximately 11 person days of software engineering time to develop. Another 2 days of time on site will be needed to install, test, and possibly alter the new package to fit the current Ft Irwin operating environment.**DO NOT SUBSTITUTE THIS ITEM WITHOUT G3 APPROVAL TO ENSURE ITEM MEETS REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS.
