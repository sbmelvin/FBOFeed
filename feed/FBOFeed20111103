(ATK) and Textron Systems Corp. (Textron), under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, a fixed price contract for updates to the system software (SW) baseline and related production equipment to support Follow-on Operational Tests (FOT) for the XM7 Spider Munition Networked Command System (Spider System).
FAR 6.302-1 is applicable to this action as the Government requires the Spider software updates to be implemented and incorporated into the system prior to scheduled test events in FY12.  Award to any other source would create unacceptable delays in meeting the Governments requirements, resulting in an inability to complete required program testing and leading to a failure to obtain required milestone approvals.

<DESC>The goal of ALASA is to develop a significantly less expensive approach for launching small satellites routinely, with a goal of at least threefold reduction in costs compared to current military and US commercial launch costs.  ALASA seeks to develop and employ radical advances in launch systems, to include the development of a complete launch vehicle requiring no recurring maintenance or support, and no specific integration to prepare for launch. The ALASA demonstration system will draw upon emerging technologies to provide increased specific impulse propellants, stable propellant formulations, hybrid propellant systems, potential "infrastructure-free" cryogen production, new motor case materials, new flight controls and mission planning techniques, new nozzle designs, improved thrust vectoring methods, and new throttling approaches.
<p>For a detailed description of this opportunity please see the attached file - DARPA-BAA-12-07 (ALASA).</p>

This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 and the business size standard is $19M. <br /><br />Period of performance is for twelve months from time of award.<br /><br />The FACS Core Facility provides flow cytometry and cell sorting support to all the laboratories in the NCI Center for Cancer Research. The FACS Core has a special order research LSR Fortessa flow cytometer. The FACS Core lab currently provides service to investigators from over 27 NCI labs and branches. It is critical that this instrument remain in excellent operating condition at all times. It is also important that the quality of the results from this instrument be kept at a consistently high level. Some experiments, if unable to be run on the instrument as scheduled, cannot be rescued. It is also important that the instrument be kept current with software upgrades and product corrective actions. <br />The contractor shall provide all labor, material and equipment to provide preventive maintenance for government-owned: <br /><br />LSR FORTESSA (No Lasers), Serial No: H17700008<br />Sapphire 488-100 Blue LSR, Serial No: NO-SERIAL-5289<br />Laser Cohr Cube 640-4- Red, Serial No: NO-SERIAL-5290<br />Laser Violet 405-100, Serial No: NO-SERIAL-5291<br />Laser Genesis 355-60 UV, Serial No: NO-SERIAL-5292<br /><br />Contractor shall provide: 1) one (1) preventive maintenance inspection per component during the contract period; 2) emergency repair services on an unlimited basis during the term of this contract; 3) all required replacement parts, with the exception of consumable parts to include batteries.

All primary service personnel shall have at least one backup support who shall have at least the same level of expertise on the equipment covered by this contract.<br /><br />NCI also depends heavily on qualified telephone troubleshooting and technical assistance from the manufacturer's staff. These assets are available from BD Biosciences. BD has at least 8 highly trained and qualified Field Service Representatives in the Washington, DC area. At any given time, several of the representatives will be on the Bethesda campus. Because the manufacturer trains these Field Service Representatives and because the manufacturer provides frequent updated continuing education for them, NCI has never had an instrument problem that could not be diagnosed and fixed quickly. BD Biosciences also keeps a full inventory of all the parts in their warehouses that can arrive on-site by the following morning to replace items that cannot immediately be repaired and returned to service. The manufacturer is the only vendor qualified to provide software upgrades to the proprietary software, product corrective actions, and telephone technical and troubleshooting assistance. The manufacturer will replace and/or repair all defective parts including lasers on an unlimited basis. Because the instrument is uniquely designed for NCI, the manufacturer is the only vendor familiar with its service requirements.

A sole source acquisition will be procured under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements." As the sole manufacturer of the VH-3D aircraft, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation is the only known source with the necessary technical data, knowledge, experience, and expertise required to perform this effort to ensure the design of the cabin interior is properly integrated into the VH-3D aircraft, while at the same time, maintaining the squadron's aircraft availability requirements in order to meet mandatory presidential and executive lift mission requirements. In order to maintain aircraft availability requirements, this effort must be done in conjunction with the overhaul of the aircraft, which is currently performed by Sikorsky under an existing contract. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement. The Government will consider all capability information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. No phone inquiries will be entertained. Responses shall be made in writing by e-mail, U.S. mail or facsimile to the attention of Mark Krukar, using the contact information provided in this synopsis.

<DESC>For this Effort NAICS Code: 334515<br /><br />334516, 334418, 334419, 334111, 335999, 334511 (For Teaming Purposes)<br /><br />1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.<br />2. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments. It is the government's intention to purchase four subsystems as described herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.<br />(a) The government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. <br />(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the NEWEG project.<br />3. NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):<br />a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz. <br />b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS. <br />c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.<br />d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).<br />The four subsystems described are as follows:<br />a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.<br />b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.<br />4. FUTURE CONCEPTS<br />The government is interested in any future concepts or projects, which your company is working that may relate to the NEWEG project. Please submit a separate report (maximum of 10 pages) on any systems, ideas, concepts, etc., which your company is currently working, is considering working, or has completed recently that could potentially bring added capability to, or reduced the cost of, this project.<br />5. SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE<br />The following is an outline for a response to this RFI. Please provide the following per subsystem response. This outline will minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government. <br />Section 1 Technological Capability <br />Identify technological capability related to the subsystem addressed. Identify open architecture, Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components, software and methodologies employed for signal and antenna pattern development. Identify target processors, operating systems and development environments. Identify any proprietary aspects. Identify interface standards used. Identify Built-In-Test (BIT) capability and calibration techniques.<br />Section 2 Technological Alternatives <br />Briefly describe one or more technological alternatives, including the reliability and technology readiness characteristics of the alternatives. Future State Concepts - The government is entertaining the idea of pursuing potential SBIR grants and other similar vehicles for new and pertinent technologies. Please provide any information, future concepts, ideas, or plans for future development that may assist any of the four areas described above. <br />Section 3 Feasibility Assessment<br />Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks.<br />Section 4 Cost and Schedule Estimates<br />Provide Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost and schedule estimates to include a confidence estimate. These assumptions are for cost estimation purposes only and the government is only seeking this information for market research purposes. This is not a request for proposals. It is not the expectation of the government that the contractor will provide a complete cost proposal. Projected costs with tradeoffs possibilities are preferred. In addition, the government requests cost breakdowns showing the price differentiation between Unlimited, Government purpose, and Limited Use data rights.<br />Section 5 Corporate Expertise<br />Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership and other information you deem relevant.<br />In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach and any relevant lessons learned.

<DESC>The NAICS Code for this effort is <strong>334515.<br /><br /></strong>334516, 334418, 334419, 334111, 335999, 334511 (For Teaming Purposes)
<p>1. SYNOPSIS<br />The United States Navy is seeking information from interested parties on a Next Generation Electronic Warfare Environment Generator (NEWEG). Electronic Warfare (EW) threat simulation capabilities must meet ever-expanding requirements for future strategic, tactical, and support aircraft with electronic combat support systems. These requirements are the result of the increasing sophistication and capabilities of threat radars and the increasing enhancements in detection and processing capabilities of EW systems. To keep pace with these new requirements, the DoD requires a higher fidelity stimulation capability and closer correlation between ground testing and flight testing. Higher fidelity stimulation capability will further reduce overall test costs and allow greater reliance on ground test results. A new generation of EW simulators/stimulators must make use of state of the art technologies, modular scalable architectures, high speed processing, and integrated radio frequency (RF) subassemblies. The Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community requires advanced software models for platform motion, direction finding, signal modulation, and environmental effects. Testing current and future Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Support Measures, and sensor fusion systems require these capabilities. EA capabilities using Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) or Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technologies are enhancing performance gains (i.e., transmitting multiple simultaneous beams), reliability, and maintainability. In order to keep pace with this new EA technology NEWEG will need to sense the jammer beams, determine their direction, characterize the waveforms, deduce the intent and impact, and generate an appropriate response simultaneously.<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system that will expand the current capabilities of EW simulators/RF stimulators and allow for sharing of information between testers, trainers, simulators and outside entities.<br />2. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 3. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the government is interested in information for individual subsystems defined in paragraph 3 and the attachments. It is the government's intention to purchase four subsystems as described herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.<br />(a) The government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. <br />(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only. <br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the NEWEG project.<br />3. NEWEG CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />The NEWEG will be an open architecture system designed to support technology insertions and address obsolescence over the expected ten-year life span, with only minor refurbishments during that time. The current notional design consists of four independent subsystems connected together via strictly controlled power, digital, timing, intermediate frequency, and RF interfaces described in detailed government owned Interface Control Documents (ICD) and Interface Design Documents (IDD). The government will integrate these capabilities as four independent subsystems into the overall NEWEG system. The government's current intention is to acquire unrestricted rights for government use for all software, development systems and resources required to rebuild, execute and modify that software. The overall NEWEG system will support the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):<br />a. The operating bandwidth will have a threshold value of 70 MHz to 40 GHz with an objective value of 20 MHz to 100 GHz. <br />b. For pulse density, the threshold requirement is 5 MPPS with an objective of 8 MPPS. <br />c. The NEWEG system will have a minimum threshold value of 60 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz. The objective value is 120 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 500 MHz to 18 GHz range; 8 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 70 MHz to 500 MHz range; and 4 ports plus 1 RF monitor port in the 18 GHz to 40 GHz range. Each RF monitor port will support the combined output for all ports specified in its respective frequency band.<br />d. All signal levels, timing and data will reflect the scenario conditions as seen from the point of view of the System under Test (SUT).<br />The four subsystems described are as follows:<br />a. Software System Control (SSC) - The SSC subsystem provides an executive level control containing the programs and data that define the simulated environment. It provides the capability to create, edit, monitor and operate real-time scenario simulations. It provides operator interface to display and control data, timing, monitor subsystem status and active scenarios. It provides the capability to create threat emitter definitions. The SSC will store the data, scenarios and libraries used to define the simulation environment. It will provide real time modeling of the emitter parameter changes as well as platform and host aircraft trajectories in an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB). The SSC will also control overall system calibration, maintenance and troubleshooting functions. All operator interaction will take place through the SSC. Additionally, it must support TENA, HLA and DIS protocols, as well as JIMM and DIADS external interfaces.<br />b. Digital Generator (DGEN) - The DGEN subsystem receives commands and data from the SSC and translates the programmed environment into a digital pulse descriptor set of words and commands. It performs all pulse-to-pulse calculations required to generate a complex emitter environment in real-time. The DGEN also handles the calculating and scheduling of pulsed descriptor waveforms for up to 8 MPPS for pulsed and modulations for non-pulsed signals.<br />c. Radio Frequency Generator (RFGEN) - The RFGEN subsystem transforms the commands from the DGEN subsystem into real-time RF pulses with proper emitter modulations in frequency, time, amplitude, Doppler and phase as directed by the DGEN on a pulse-to-pulse basis for pulsed signals and near continuous for other signals. The RFGEN will transmit these signals either free-space radiation or by direct-injection using RF-over-fiber devices or RF cabling to the SUT.<br />d. Monitor and Analysis (MAA) - The MAA subsystem provides the RF receiver capability to monitor, distribute and record digital and RF data for analysis. It will also provide the capability to replay recorded data and monitor tests. The MAA will incorporate calibration functionality. All MAA capabilities will be provided to an external interface to allow SSC and external systems access to on-going tests. The MAA provides the RF receive capability for test monitoring, calibration and SUT signals (including jamming). It also includes the RF distribution capability for the received RF, IF, video or digital output. Closed-Loop feedback into the SSC in response to received RF provides the coherent jammer analysis capability and real-time monitoring of the RF signals generated by the SUT.<br />4. FUTURE CONCEPTS<br />The government is interested in any future concepts or projects, which your company is working that may relate to the NEWEG project. Please submit a separate report (maximum of 10 pages) on any systems, ideas, concepts, etc., which your company is currently working, is considering working, or has completed recently that could potentially bring added capability to, or reduced the cost of, this project.<br />5. SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE<br />The following is an outline for a response to this RFI. Please provide the following per subsystem response. This outline will minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government. <br />Section 1 Technological Capability <br />Identify technological capability related to the subsystem addressed. Identify open architecture, Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components, software and methodologies employed for signal and antenna pattern development. Identify target processors, operating systems and development environments. Identify any proprietary aspects. Identify interface standards used. Identify Built-In-Test (BIT) capability and calibration techniques.<br />Section 2 Technological Alternatives <br />Briefly describe one or more technological alternatives, including the reliability and technology readiness characteristics of the alternatives. Future State Concepts - The government is entertaining the idea of pursuing potential SBIR grants and other similar vehicles for new and pertinent technologies. Please provide any information, future concepts, ideas, or plans for future development that may assist any of the four areas described above. <br />Section 3 Feasibility Assessment<br />Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks.<br />Section 4 Cost and Schedule Estimates<br />Provide Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost and schedule estimates to include a confidence estimate. These assumptions are for cost estimation purposes only and the government is only seeking this information for market research purposes. This is not a request for proposals. It is not the expectation of the government that the contractor will provide a complete cost proposal. Projected costs with tradeoffs possibilities are preferred. In addition, the government requests cost breakdowns showing the price differentiation between Unlimited, Government purpose, and Limited Use data rights.<br />Section 5 Corporate Expertise<br />Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership and other information you deem relevant.<br />In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach and any relevant lessons learned.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

DESCRIPTION:

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), through the Veterans Benefits Administration
(VBA), administers the Compensation & Pension (C&P) Program for benefits for
Veterans, their dependents and their survivors. Entitlement determinations for disability
compensation claims and disability pension claims are made by VBA Rating Veterans
Service Representatives (RVSRs) working in VA Regional Offices (VAROs) across the
country. A medical disability examination (MDE) is a critical piece of evidence for determining
the extent of permanent impairment and the dollar benefit a veteran is awarded.

Congress enacted the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 1996 (PL 104-275) on
October 9, 1996, which authorized VA to conduct a limited pilot program to contract for
MDEs from non-VA medical sources. Under PL 108-183, Section 704, Congress granted
VA temporary authority to contract out for MDEs, which is in addition to the authority
provided in PL 104-275. 

VBA has a requirement to provide MDEs from non-VA medical sources based on Public Laws 104-275 and 108-183. The purpose of this requirement is to obtain high quality examination reports from responsible, responsive and experienced contractors. The examination reports must provide essential information to support each disability diagnosed for the various areas including, but not limited to, the following:  musculoskeletal; organs of sense; infectious, immune, and nutritional deficiencies; respiratory; cardiovascular; digestive; genitourinary; gynecological and breast; hemic and lymphatic; skin; endocrine; neurologic; mental disorders; dental and oral examinations. 

VBA intends to issue solicitations during FY 2012 for MDE services in support of PL 104-275 and 108-183. Specific details regarding the requirements will be provided when solicitations are issued. An industry day and/or RFI may be issued. If issued, the synopsis would be amended accordingly.

<DESC>Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information & Technology (OIT) - Bidirectional Health Information Exchange (BHIE) System Performance Monitoring Software

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE USED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION DECISIONS.  A SUBSEQUENT SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT MAY FOLLOW.  RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE TO ANY FUTURE ANNOUNCEMENT.

** Note:  The VA intends to set-aside this procurement for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) and veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs). **

The BHIE program office requires a system performance monitoring software solution to manage its information technology assets through visually rich, responsive, and personalized business intelligence dashboards.  The system performance monitoring solution must bring BHIE's disparate resource monitoring applications into a single real-time dashboard to reduce maintenance cost, meet service level agreements, and increase the team's response time.  The desired solution will provide VA Systems Administrators and VA Service Support Technicians with dashboards relaying real-time data, user-level customization of dashboards, drilldown to charts, dashboards and web Uniform Resource Locators, and real-time analytics to perform data calculations and track statistical outliers.  The desired software solution is necessary to ensure contiguous real-time monitoring of the BHIE System.  This includes the continuous, real-time monitoring of the development, test, production, and Continuity of Operations (COOP) environments within the BHIE systems.  

** The system performance monitoring software must meet or exceed the functionalities described in PWS Attachment A, entitled "System Performance Monitoring Software Requirements." **

The VA also requires software installation support, software configuration support, software training, and all documentation necessary to complete the tasks of the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A draft PWS is included as an attachment to this announcement.

<DESC>This announcement is for Sources Sought; those parties interested, please send us your capabilities concerning the announcement below.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The intent is to notify potential contractors of the upcoming Utilities service acquisition (NAICS code 221122 and size standard 4 million megawatt hours). The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, tools, equipment, and supervision necessary to supply and deliver uninterrupted electrical power and demand to meet the Government's needs at F. E. Warren Air Force Base, WY. Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) provides a portion of the power requirements for the base and the contractor will provide over and above WAPA. The approximate requirement is 6 MW of demand and 24,000,000 kWh/year energy.<span style="COLOR: red"> </span>The control will include scheduling and firming up 3.4 MW of wind power owned by the Government. At least two generation sources for the power are required (contract with another power producer for firm power is acceptable).<span style="COLOR: red"> </span>The sources for generation must be in place at time of award.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No generation can be built on base.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of the power may be redistributed to the privatized military family housing on base and reimbursed.<span style="COLOR: red"> </span>If the interested party has green power available it should be noted in their response. Load profiles will be included in the solicitation package. The contractor must be able to enter WAPA's grid at any point acceptable to WAPA. Power is delivered to the base through the Government's 20 MW substation that is attached to WAPA's grid, at 115 KV primary to a 13.8 KV base distribution system. The period of performance for the resultant utilities service contract is ten (10) years.<span style="COLOR: red"> </span>For contract pricing structure, use of an energy price index, rather than firm-fixed pricing, is being considered. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government at this time. In order to assess set-aside possibilities, interested parties are invited to respond by submitting a letter identifying your business as: 1) small business (SB), 2) 8(a) contractor, 3) small disadvantaged business (SDB), 4) HUBZone small business, 5) service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), or 6) woman-owned small business (WOSB) under NAICS code 221122 with a size standard of 4 million megawatt hours. The solicitation will be available only via the Internet at the following address: https://www.fbo.gov (FedBizOpps). Questions should be addressed to Mr. Ryan Oberholtzer at 307-773-6649. Note: Contractor must be actively registered with Central Contractor Registration to be eligible for contract award or payment from the DoD activity. Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423. </span></p>

The Contractor shall provide commercial warranties to all locations within and Outside the Continental United States (CONUS/OCONUS) for all products delivered. The basic warranty shall be no less in length than the OEM standard commercial warranty or one year, whichever is greater, however, extended warranties may be purchased.

Tests to verify production hardware will be conducted as part of this effort using test articles from the production line established by the potential source.
The Spider system currently in production meets the Presidents Anti-Personnel Landmine (APL) policy with regards to Non-Self Destruct/Self-Destruct APL. Spider is a stand-alone weapon system consisting of three main hardware components: a Remote Control Station (RCS), a Repeater for extended communications, and a Munition Control Unit (MCU), capable of containing up to six individual Miniature Grenade Launchers (MGLs) or NLLs.  Spider will be compatible with the U.S. Army battlefield key management infrastructure and the Navy Electronic Key Management System (EKMS). Spider must meet the Communications Security (COMSEC) and Transmission Security (TRANSEC) requirements contained in the Spider Security Policy. Spider is currently using removable media compatible with the Force XXI Battle Command Battalion/Brigade and Below (FBCB2), an indirect interface.

<DESC>IntroductionMaintaining existing and growing commercial, governmental, and national security orbitalassets indicates a need for extending the development and dissemination of on-orbitrobotic servicing capabilities for existing and future spacecraft.  NASA acknowledgesthat the commercial satellite industry has the proven capability to finance, design,develop, integrate, operate and own complex satellite systems.	NASA is also aware thatsome in the industry are interested in providing satellite servicing as a commercialservice. NASA seeks suggestions on methods for the agency to energize/stimulate/enablethe development of a domestic and commercial capability in robotic satellite servicing.NASA is soliciting information through this RFI to gather market research to assist NASAin developing strategies for supporting the development and dissemination of on-orbitrobotic servicing capabilities for existing and future spacecraft, particularly includingstrategies involving collaboration with private domestic entities that leverage theGovernments existing intellectual property, technological resources, and expertise inthis area.   NASA does not intend to establish a Government operated on-orbit satelliteservicing capacity but rather to foster the creation of a domestic capability which maymeet both future Government and non-government needs.	Satellite servicing capabilitiesmay include satellite recovery, repair, relocation, refueling, inspection, subsystem orcomponent replacement, or other services that extend the life or capabilities of on-orbitassets.This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment,implied or otherwise, that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) willtake procurement action in this matter.  Further, neither NASA, nor the Government willbe responsible for any costs incurred in furnishing this information.The complete RFI document can be found in the attached file described as, "SSCO RFI".

<DESC><strong>This is a Sources Sought notice.</strong> This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.<br /><br /><strong>Background.</strong> The Comparative Medicine Branch (CMB) maintains the animal facility for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). The health of the animals is a critical factor in many research projects. Laboratory animals are susceptible to many different diseases, which may be symptomatic or subclinical but still have profound effects on research. Some of the diseases can be zoonotic (contagious to humans). Diagnosis of these animal diseases is very important in maintaining the quality of the NIEHS research animals as well as ensuring the safety of the researcher and animal care staff. The CMB oversees the care and use of these animals. The Quality Assurance Laboratory (QAL), a laboratory within CMB, is responsible for monitoring the health status of incoming and resident animal colonies and making appropriate decisions based on the results of this monitoring. The animals used as sentinels for colony health status are evaluated by the QAL staff. This evaluation may include, as appropriate, a complete necropsy, examination for ecto and endo parasites, bacterial cultures, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and/or serological assays. Animals which appear ill or die are also submitted to the QAL for diagnostic services. The QAL is responsible for reporting the health status of the animal or tissue specimens back to the appropriate veterinarian(s) and researchers. <br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objective.</strong> The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain the services of a commercial laboratory for the serological analysis, PCR and related assay rodent sera, tissues, and fecal specimens used to monitor the health of NIEHS animal colonies. To provide a readily available source of Serology Assay Testing Services and PCR assays to meet the needs of the QAL and NIEHS. The overall objective is to provide serological testing and PCR assays for the diagnostic and health monitoring programs of the NIEHS. The specific objective is to have a Contractor receive serology samples, perform testing on these samples and report the positive and negative results.<br /><br /><strong>Project Requirements.</strong> <strong>(1)</strong> The scope of this requirement will be to perform the serology testing necessary to complete the animal health monitoring process. In addition to the serological testing, PCRs, may be requested to determine the presence of an agent in an animal facility or may be used in conjunction with serology as a method of health surveillance. Other assays, such as Western Blot or Immunofluorescent Antibody (IFA) may be requested to confirm initial positive serological results. <br /><strong>(2)</strong> The Contractor shall perform serological testing and/or PCR testing in accordance with good laboratory practices, and state of the art microbiological procedures. The number of tests requested per sample will depend upon species and the animal's history. <br /><strong>(3)</strong> Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services (except as otherwise specified herein) and perform the work set forth below.<br /><strong>(4)</strong> Based on what we feel is in the best interest of the Government the PCR and Serological services may be awarded in either one or two contracts. The serological assays, such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), Multiplex Fluorescent Immunoassay (MFI), IFA, Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) and Western Blot, may be awarded separately from the PCR assays for the presence of viral antigens in cell cultures, tissues, feces, and swabs.<br /><strong>(5)</strong> Serological Tests: <em><strong>(a)</strong></em> The Contractor shall, as a minimum, be prepared to perform serological assays by appropriate methods such as MFI, IFA, ELISA, and HAI, as appropriate. IFA and/or Western Blot methodology should be available for confirmatory testing. Should new testing technology become available or new pathogenic agents be discovered during the course of this offering, it will be incorporated through modification of the Contract.<br /><em><strong>(b)</strong></em> Rodent sera shall be processed (diluted 1.5 and heat inactivated at 56&deg;C for 30 minutes), frozen in 2 ml cryotubes labeled with the QAL's identification number and shipped in leak proof styrofoam containers with dry ice. The styrofoam container will be delivered to the Contractor by express overnight delivery service by NIEHS personnel. The Contractor shall receive the samples delivered by the express delivery service at the Contractor's own expense.

<DESC>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), this notice is being issued as a Request For Information (RFI). The US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Program Executive Office (PEO) Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons (U&amp;W), Precision Strike Weapons Program (PMA-201) is seeking information from industry on innovative concepts for evolutionary improvements to the performance characteristics of the FMU-139 electronic tail fuze. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. This RFI is intended to be used for market research and technology survey purposes to assist PMA-201 in developing an acquisition strategy for potential future competition. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by responders to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. <br /><br /><strong>General Description:</strong>The FMU-139 fuze provides warhead initiation for general purpose bomb bodies used in freefall and guided weapons. The FMU-139 is an in-service electro-mechanical fuze with instantaneous and delayed fuze functions. The requirements for FMU-139 fuze capabilities are expanding and many of the technologies utilized in the current FMU-139 configuration are anticipated to face future challenges in obsolescence and manufacturability. The intent of this effort is to evaluate technologies and identify potential technology insertion opportunities to facilitate an FMU-139 fuze upgrade process through an evolutionary upgrade approach. As a result of this RFI, the Government expects to receive responses from interested, capable and qualified sources in the form of a concept summary paper containing a description of technical data defining proposed upgrade concepts. The concept summary paper shall be written from a system solution perspective showing how the concept and development methodology could satisfy below stated requirements. Each concept summary paper should include a top level description of the proposed upgrade concepts, a detailed list of anticipated end product physical and performance characteristics, scope of development effort, anticipated reliability and maintainability characteristics, weapon/aircraft integration/interface concept, design provisions to support incremental upgrades, technology insertion opportunities, an assessment of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the proposed concepts including key subsystems, and a description of the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for the proposed concepts. FMU-139 Fuze upgrade concepts shall address ability to maintain current integration capability with the F/A-18A+/C/D/E/F and the AV-8B fixed wing aircraft. Desired upgrade concepts include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; Hardened target capability (threshold = 5,000 PSI target, Objective = 15,000 PSI target). <br />&bull; Serial Data Interface (SDI) technology to enable communication between fuze and aircraft Operational Flight Program.<br />&bull; An in-line or other electronic design. Of special interest would be a design to minimize the number of moving parts and electro-explosive devices in the fuze. Reduction in overall part and assembly counts in the fuze structure and circuit card assemblies with the desired result of improved fuze producability and reliability. <br />&bull; Replacement of current retard and impact sensors with any number of low power sensors including, but not limited to, piezoelectric sensors, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) devices, rolleron devices, and investigation of the sensor designs currently used in the automotive industry. Of special interest would be the speed and consistency of detection timing, as well as producability and reliability improvements.<br />&bull; Detonator Improvements, including the use of a possible replacement material for both the Lead Azide and Lead Styphnate ultimately leading to the qualification of a lead-free detonator.<br />&bull; Front panel switch improvement or replacement, to improve upon the producability, reliability, and aging concerns that have been experienced.<br />&bull; Post-impact intelligent fuzing, allowing for fuze reaction to terminal impact conditions.<br />&bull; Variable output fuzing for initiation of selectable output weapons.<br />&bull; Environmental Sensing concept to prevent fuze detonation until external conditions are consistent with the intended arming environment conditions. <br />&bull; Fuzes that can respond to post-release instructions from the aircraft. Of interest would be a fuze that could disarm, disable, or self-destruct after it has already armed based on input from the aircraft or other external source. <br />&bull; FZU-48 alternatives such as higher reliability alternators, alternate airflow systems and release signal generation systems could result in a design more suitable to current and future extended time of fall, high altitude release, and precision guided weapons.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) is seeking potential sources to support the Chief of Naval Aviation Trainings (CNATRA) T-44C (Navy configured Raytheon/Beechcraft King Air C-90 ProLine 21) pilot training program. 

The Chief of Naval Aviation Training (CNATRA) requires simulator support for the following individual pilot training course: Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS Flight Training (CNATRAINST 1542.147D) (https://www.cnatra.navy.mil/pubs/folder2/1542.147D.pdf).
The purpose of the Advanced Multi-Engine MPTS Flight Training is to develop multi-engine flight skills while emphasizing instrument flying and crew coordination.  At the successful completion of this training, the flight student will be designated a naval aviator or USAF pilot qualified in multi-engine aircraft, and will have earned a standard instrument rating.
 

This training will require a contractor provided T-44C ProLine 21(PL) Flight Training Device (FTD) and contractor maintenance support of the device(s).   Currently, T-44 (Beechcraft King Air C-90) pilot training is provided by CNATRA on an in-house basis through various sources, including a combination of Government provided and contractor provided personnel and equipment.  The Government is in the process of formulating requirements, based on one of the optional solutions listed below, for conducting the simulator portion of training for T-44C ProLine 21 (C-90 ProLine 21) pilots.  The T-44C PL 21 simulator training will require the use of a contractor provided T-44C (Beechcraft King Air C-90 ProLine 21) FAA equivalent Level 7 flight training device(s) (FAA certification is not required) with a freeze and reset capability and a FAA Level C (or higher) equivalent visual system capable of projecting a minimum 200-degree horizontal by a 45-degree vertical field of view (preferably up to 220 x 60 degree FOV) and the capability to simulate VMC, IMC, day, and night conditions.
 The optional solutions in order of preference include:

1.)	  Government would provide an appropriate facility at NAS Corpus Christi, TX for the contractor to set up, operate and maintain the contractor provided T-44C FTD(s) (minimally one (1) device with an option to provide up to four (4) T-44C FTDs), using Government provided instructors and T-44 curriculum (CNATRAINST 1542.147D).  An alternative option would be for the contractor to use their own contractor provided instructors, in lieu of Government instructors, using a Government provided T-44 curriculum. 

2.)	  Contractor owned/operated training devices would be located at a contractor provided facility in the Corpus Christi, TX area using Government provided instructors and the Government provided T-44 curriculum (i.e.
 leasing of contractor provided and maintained devices).  An alternative option would be for the contractor to provide the T-44C FTDs in the Corpus Christi, TX area using the contractor provided facility and instructors, using a Government provided T-44 curriculum. 

3.)	  Contractor would provide the training device(s), support personnel, and facilities for Government leasing at the contractors current training facility.  The Government would provide qualified T-44C instructors and curriculum, using the contractor provided T-44C FTDs and facilities.  An alternative option in this category would be for the contractor to provide the T-44C FTDs, facilities and contract instructors using the Government provided T-44 curriculum.
  

Contractor will be required to minimally provide one or more T-44C PL 21 (C-90 ProLine 21) Flight Training Device(s), support personnel required to operate and maintain the devices, and (if providing Academic/Simulator instructors) any additional labor required for supervising and administering classroom and simulator training; along with data rights for any contractor specific materials for this contracted training.  The Government will provide (as required, depending on option); facilities to support one or more (up to four (4)) T-44C PL 21 (C-90 ProLine 21) FTDs, all required course curriculum/syllabi, Government simulator/academic instructors (as required), and any additional Government specific courseware/materials needed for the training of T-44C pilots.
  These T-44C PL 21training courses require both classroom academic and practical training using one or more T-44C PL 21 FTDs.  The FTDs will be required to simulate the performance and functional operation of the T-44C PL 21 aircraft and will be required to minimally meet FAA Level 7 FTD certification requirements as defined under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-45A (FAA certification is not required).  The contractor will use either contractor provided facilities and instructors or the Government-furnished facilities and instructors.  Under all optional solutions, the Government provided course syllabi will be used in conducting all classroom and simulator training.  All instructors must:  1) have a minimum of 1,000 flight hours; 2) have knowledge of Department of Defense (DOD) rules and regulations governing aircraft operations; and 3) be either a prior military pilot or possess an FAA flight instructor certificate with an instrument rating.
 

Businesses having the capabilities and facilities, including existing simulators, are invited to submit the following: 1) description of capabilities as they relate to the above requirements; 2) describe ability to provide the required T-44C PL 21 FTD(s) (minimum of one (1) with an option to provide up to four (4) FTDs); 3) specify the contractors  preference of providing training at a contractor or Government provided facility and describe contractors ability to relocate and install a qualified device to a Government facility, as applicable; 4) business size/status (NAICS code for this requirement is 611512, size standard - $25.5M); and, 5) listing of contracts performing similar services (past or present), including references.
  Responses will serve as a basis for the government's decision to fulfill this requirement under a set-aside, full and open competition, or sole source acquisition.  Responses or questions are requested to be sent via email to alan.wright@navy.mil, but can be faxed to 407-380-4742, or mailed to: Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division; ATTN: A.

<DESC>This is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a Sources Sought Notice only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is for market research purposes to determine if capable, qualified small businesses (including Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, 8(a) firms, Small Disadvantage Business (SDB)) relative to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561110 - Office Administrative Services (size standard of $7,000,000 in gross annual receipts or income as defined in 13 CFR &sect; 121.104) possess the capability to support the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)'s Office of Site Remediation Enforcement requirement. Responses to this sources sought notice shall not constitute responses to any solicitation, which is not currently available. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.
<p>The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g. SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The intent of this notice is to request information from small business concerns in their efforts to provide analytical, managerial, and technical services to the EPA's Office of Site Remediation Enforcement performed pursuant to the OSRE-3 Statement of Work.

<p>The EPA is seeking market research into whether capable small business sources are able to provide analytical, technical, and support services for EPA's Office of Site Remediation Enforcement (OSRE) that support remediation efforts to plan, implement, and enforce programs, strategies, guidance, and regulations under the Agency's statutes described above. EPA will use any future resultant contract to acquire assistance in developing nationwide implementation strategies, monitoring regional and state enforcement activities, and providing enforcement support. This assistance shall involve analytical support used by EPA in implementing any policies, regulations, or guidance pertaining to EPA enforcement activities under CERCLA, RCRA Corrective Action, LUST, or OPA or future re-authorizations or amendments.<br /><br />"Site Remediation" means environmental cleanup. The statutes listed above deal with sites where there's been a migration or a release, or a threat of release of hazardous substances into the environment. Which statute to use depends on what kind of release there's been and from where.</p>
<p>"Enforcement" is when EPA investigates the identity of, and negotiates with parties to do the cleanup or to recover the costs of a cleanup. More about OSRE is available on the Agency's website at www.epa.gov/aboutepa/oeca.html. Information concerning the Agency's cleanup enforcement program is available at http://www.epa.gov/compliance/cleanup.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT (LOE)<br />The Government anticipates awarding a Cost-Reimbursement Plus-Fixed-Fee contract with a one year base period, and four (4), one (1) year option periods for a total maximum period of performance of 5 years. The estimated level of effort for this requirement, in professional labor hours, is as follows:<br />&bull; 4,524 Basic Quantity LOE hours and 10,285 Optional Quantity LOE Hours for each year of the contract (base period and all four option periods). <br />&bull; Maximum potential LOE for all years is 74,045 hours with a maximum potential period of performance of 5 years.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT:</p>
<p>To help determine if this potential requirement may be set-aside for small business concerns, the Government is seeking input from the small business community regarding their interest and capability in performing the tasks reflected in the draft SOW.

<SUBJECT>Purchase of electricity from renewable sources not located on GSA property
<SOLNBR>GS-00P-12-BSC-0867
<RESPDATE>120111
<ARCHDATE>06012012
<CONTACT>Ken J. Shutika, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 260-9713, Fax (202) 401-3722, Email ken.shutika@gsa.gov
<DESC><p>Request for Information<br />U.S. General Services Administration<br />Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) Issues<br />Grid Based Projects</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>In order to meet agency goals and respond to increasing demand for renewable energy, stemming from renewable goals established in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Executive Order 13423, and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is attempting to facilitate project development through the purchase of electricity from new renewable sources not located on GSA property.</p>
<p>GSA defines "new renewable resources" as renewable resources that are not in service as of the date any resultant contract were to be signed.&nbsp; Incremental new renewable resources defined as new expansions of existing renewable resources not in service as of the date any resultant contract were to be signed would be considered "new renewable resources" for the purposes of this initiative.&nbsp; In addition, only resources that meet the definition of "renewable energy" contained in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 will qualify renewable resources.</p>
<p>One means of facilitating the development of new renewable resources is through the use of long term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), whereby a third party funds, develops, operates, maintains and owns a renewable energy project, and GSA commits to purchase the energy, capacity and/or renewable energy certificates (RECs) from the project owner.&nbsp; The cost of the project is amortized over a longer term with the expectation of achieving a power price in the PPA that is relatively constant for the life of the contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the PPA contracting vehicle is an attractive solution to help GSA meet its renewable and other goals, GSA believes that there may be issues/barriers to implementing PPAs.&nbsp; This RFI identifies some of these issues/barriers and seeks private sector input regarding how to best address them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND NEED FOR INFORMATION</p>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit input from industry for GSA's consideration in order to develop and/or improve potential future PPA procurements.&nbsp; GSA is interested in information on topics such as contract term limitations, delivery date, termination for convenience and indicative pricing.&nbsp; This is solely a request for information and not a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Issue: Contract Term Limitations</p>
<p>Many renewable PPA projects require a long term (often 20 years) contract in order to be financially viable.&nbsp; A longer term contract allows the PPA provider to charge a lower energy price since there is more time to recoup capital costs and make a profit.&nbsp; Outside of a few longer term contract options, GSA is limited by the Federal Acquisition Regulation's (FAR) Part 41 ten (10) year contract authority.&nbsp; The following potential solutions to improve project viability within the ten (10) year contracting limitation are being explored based on current statutes and regulations:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;Ten (10) year PPA contract (using FAR Part 41).&nbsp; At the end of the PPA contract, the contractor and GSA would have no further contractual obligations to each other.&nbsp; <br />2)&nbsp;Ten (10) year PPA contract (using FAR Part 41), with ten (10) year option. This option must be a "true" option, requiring: 1) No assumption that the option will be exercised and 2) No penalties if the option is not exercised.&nbsp; The price could be negotiated at the time of the option or established in the original contract.<br />NOTE:&nbsp; The GSA is still investigating whether this is a legal and viable option under FAR Part 41 and other binding laws and regulations; however, GSA would like input from industry on this topic.<br />3)&nbsp;Ten (10) year PPA contract (using FAR 41) with a series of shorter term (1-5 year) options.&nbsp; At the end of the PPA contract, the options would be "true" options but option terms could be from 1 to 5 years in length and total no more than 10 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions:<br />a)&nbsp;Can a ten (10) PPA be developed at or near current market prices?<br />b)&nbsp;What are the cost impacts of a ten (10) year term?<br />c)&nbsp;What are the cost impacts of a ten (10) year PPA contract with a ten (10) year option?<br />d)&nbsp;Could these options help to reduce the PPA price and/or alleviate the financing risk?&nbsp; <br />e)&nbsp;What would the optimal financing term be for the type of renewable resource that your firm is interested in developing?&nbsp; <br />f)&nbsp;What are other potential solutions to overcome the current ten (10) year contract term limit?<br />g)&nbsp;What are other potential risks associated with these options?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Issue: Delivery Date for Supply from the Renewable Project</p>
<p>GSA realizes that an exact delivery date is difficult to specify.&nbsp; Therefore, GSA proposes that the contract term of ten (10) years begin within 24 months of the execution of the final contract.&nbsp; To allow for the uncertainties associated with project development, GSA is willing to allow the Contractor to delay the start date by 12 months provided GSA receives 6 months advance notice.&nbsp; The ten (10) year contract term start would be delayed by any contract start date delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions:<br />a)&nbsp;Will the flexible start date assist project development?&nbsp; <br />b)&nbsp;How long do your project(s) typically take to develop?&nbsp; <br />c)&nbsp;What is a reasonable start date range for the type of renewable resource your firm is developing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Issue: Termination for Convenience (T4C)</p>
<p>Some renewable developers have expressed concern with Federal termination clauses.&nbsp; The GSA does not terminate for convenience without a legitimate reason/cause.&nbsp; All costs associated with a termination for convenience shall be resolved in accordance with FAR Part 49.</p>
<p>Questions:<br />a)&nbsp;What are your specific concerns with the GSA's standard termination for convenience (T4C) clause language in FAR 52.212-4(L)?<br />b)&nbsp;What types of termination schedules are typical (e.g., early termination during construction; before tax credits are utilized; after tax credits are utilized; partial termination; other)?<br />c)&nbsp;Are there any other comments or potential solutions regarding T4C and/or termination schedules?<br />d)&nbsp;Is it possible to include a simple T4C schedule similar to an amortization schedule with a standard mortgage?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Issue: Indicative Pricing</p>
<p>While GSA is interested in developing new renewable resources, GSA is price sensitive.&nbsp; Therefore, GSA requests that respondents provide GSA with non-binding indicative pricing for a ten (10) year term in response to this RFI.&nbsp; Respondents may also provide pricing for what the respondent considers an optimal contract term.&nbsp; Also, GSA is providing a sample Term Sheet that would encompass in a brief statement pricing elements of that GSA would expect in a typical pricing term sheet.&nbsp; GSA is also interested in any annual price escalation factors that the respondent would typically include in its contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions:<br />a)&nbsp;What is the optimal contract term for your renewable projects?&nbsp; <br />b)&nbsp;What is the best way to monetize the REC value from the renewable resource over a long term?&nbsp; Would it be best for GSA to guarantee a floor price for the RECs, but allow the RECs to be sold for shorter time periods to maximize potential REC value?&nbsp; Is there a market for long term RECs (i.e. longer than 5 years)?<br />c)&nbsp;Besides the RECs, would GSA own any other environmental attributes, including any emissions credits, associated with the new renewable resource?&nbsp; <br />d)&nbsp;From a settlement standpoint, GSA would prefer to receive blocks of around the clock (ATC) power deliveries for a specified number of MWs.&nbsp; Please explain if your firm would be able to deliver a specified ATC MW block from the new resource or if your firm would need to offer output on a unit contingent basis?<br />e)&nbsp;One of the potential benefits of purchasing new renewable energy is that there can be no or limited input fuel costs and the pricing is primarily the cost of financing and profit for the project spread out over the term of the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than fairly minor adjustments for operations and maintenance and taxes, what reason would there be for an annual price escalation?&nbsp; Should the escalation be in any way linked to the market price of power?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS<br />Responses may be of any length up to twenty (20) pages total.&nbsp; Include a brief, one (1) page or less summary of company background and PPA/renewable development project experience with your responses.&nbsp; The remaining pages shall be used to respond to the RFI questions and propose any project development ideas that your firm may have.&nbsp; Respondents may submit responses to all or a portion of the RFI questions.&nbsp; A copy of your boiler plate PPA contract language can be included as an attachment.</p>
<p>DUE DATE</p>
<p>Responses are required to be submitted no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, <br />December 1, 2011.</p>
<p>BUSINESS SENSITIVE, PROPRIETARY, OR OTHERWISE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Because information received in response to this RFI may be used to structure future solicitations and/or otherwise be made available to the public, respondents are strongly advised NOT to include any information in their responses which may be considered business sensitive, proprietary, or otherwise confidential.&nbsp; However, if your company chooses to submit any business sensitive, proprietary, or otherwise confidential information, it must be marked as proprietary or restricted data in the response.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers</p>
<p>Questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted to Ken Shutika at GSA at ken.shutika@gsa.gov and marked RFI Questions.</p>
<p>EVALUATION AND ADMINISTRATION BY FEDERAL AND NON-FEDERAL PERSONNEL</p>
<p>GSA civil servant employees are subject to the non-disclosure obligations of a felony criminal statute, the Trade Secrets Act, 18 USC 1905.&nbsp; The GSA may seek the advice of qualified non-Federal personnel.&nbsp; The GSA may also use non-Federal personnel to conduct routine, nondiscretionary administrative activities.&nbsp; The respondents, by submitting its response, consent to GSA providing their response to non-Federal parties.&nbsp; Non-Federal parties given access to responses must be subject to an appropriate obligation of confidentiality prior to being given the access.&nbsp; Submissions may be reviewed by support contractors and private consultants.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT NOTES</p>
<p>This is an RFI issued solely for information and program planning purposes; this RFI does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or abstracts.&nbsp; Your response to this notice will be treated as information only.&nbsp; In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the GSA to form a binding contract.&nbsp; GSA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred in responding to this RFI.&nbsp; Respondents are advised that GSA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.&nbsp; Responses to this RFI do not bind GSA to any further actions related to this topic.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT SUPPORT SERVICES

RFI closes 1500 PM Eastern Standard Time, November 30, 2011.

Confidentiality

All information included in this Request for Information is confidential and only for the recipient's knowledge.  No information included in this document or in discussion connected to it may be disclosed to any other party outside the Government.

Introduction and purpose of this RFI

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will take procurement action in this matter.  Further, neither VA nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.

This RFI is being used to gather market research to help VA refine its Performance Based Work Statement (PBWS) for Infrastructure Operations Management Support Services for VA Learning University, Learning Content Management System (LCMS) and Talent Management System (TMS).

The refined PBWS will be included in any resultant Request for Quote to be release within Fiscal Year 2012 to solicit quotes for the required Infrastructure Operations Management Support Services for LCMS and TMS.  

Background

As part of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Human Capital Investment Plan (HCIP), VA has recently undertaken an ambitious transformation effort designed to improve service to our Nation's Veterans, including a commitment to invest in employees at all levels of the employee life cycle.  Employee development is a primary target of many of these transformation initiatives.  As a foundation for these initiatives, a supporting technological infrastructure is necessary.  The VA Learning University (VALU) has implemented the basic learning infrastructure and will be expanding it to meet the needs of the Department.  

In October 2007, VA implemented an enterprise Learning Management System (LMS) to support employee development efforts at the national level.  Up until that point the offering, delivery, and tracking of learning was primarily managed at the facility level. Disparate systems were either built or purchased locally, and resources were dedicated locally, to manage the efforts.  Neither centralized reporting capability, nor any standard content development or implementation procedures were available to the Department.

Section 112(k) requires the development of standards for area sources which account for 90% of the emissions in urban areas of the 33 urban hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) listed in the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy.  In addition to developing standards that regulate the emissions of air toxics from stationary sources, SPPD is responsible for developing stationary source criteria pollutant standards.

(Biopath) to perform a Phase 3 efficacy trial involving a leading dengue vaccine candidate. Over the past 18 months, BioPath successfully performed a preparatory study to evaluate their ability to adequately perform a large scale phase 3 efficacy studies in Cebu City, Philippines.   As a result of this performance, the U. S. Government has selected BioPath for continued support of this phase 3 efficacy trial.  Subsequently, the phase 3 efficacy study protocol has been approved by all Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), the US Food and Drug Administration, and all applicable Government IRBs.    <br><br>This is a continuation of the effort conducted over the prior 18 months. Award to another contractor would result in significant delays and additional costs.  Ultimately, these delays would result in clinical hold, potentially cancelation of the study and additional costs. Aside from being cost prohibited to the U.S. Government and potentially dangerous to  subjects, switching contractors could jeopardize the relationships the U.S. Government has with the Philippines MOPH and Cebu City government as well as jeopardize the validity of the research results obtained thus far in the early stages of the phase 3 efficacy trial. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.<br><br>Place of Contract Performance - Cebu City, Philippines<br><br>Set-aside Status: Unrestricted<br>

A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />All referenced Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses and provisions in this solicitation may be accessed via the internet at https://farsite.hill.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.102 (g) and with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The Solicitation number is: OPM20-11-T-0019 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-53 dated August 4, 2011.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 721110, and the small business size standard is $30.0 million. This procurement is unrestricted, allowing both large and small business to submit quotations.</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM), Employee Services (ES) provides policy direction and leadership in designing, developing and promulgating Government-wide human resources systems and programs for recruitment, pay, leave, performance management and recognition, employee development, work/life/wellness programs and labor and employee relations; provides technical support to agencies regarding the full range of human resources management policies and practices, to include veterans' employment and agency program evaluation; and manages the operation of OPM's internal human resources program.</p>
<p>ES's Recruitment and Hiring designs, develops, and promulgates merit-based employment systems, policies, regulations, and programs that Federal agencies use to recruit, examine, hire, classify and assess high quality employees from diverse backgrounds. Recruitment and USAJOBS&reg;, a sub-component of ES, is responsible for designing, developing, and managing USAJOBS, Student Programs, and Diversity Policy and Outreach. Specifically, Student Programs is responsible for Government-wide student programs, such as Student Educational Employment Programs (STEP/SCEP), Presidential Management Fellows (PMF), and for building a "student ambassador" and "college recruitment" program.</p>
<p>Bearing the Presidential moniker, the PMF Program is a flagship leadership development program at the entry level for advanced degree candidates. It was created more than three decades ago by Executive Order and has gone through many changes over the years. The PMF Program brings in graduate degree candidates from diverse educational backgrounds into the Federal government.</p>
<p>The Program is highly selective and competitive. In fiscal year 2011, less than 900 applicants were selected as Finalists out of an applicant pool of over 9,000. After being deemed a Finalist, a prospective PMF must find a job in a participating Federal department or Agency. If they successfully complete the requirements of the Program, PMFs can be noncompetitively converted to permanent, full-time status at the end of the two-year period.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2011, the Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) Program assessment process restored the in-person component to the selection and assessment process. This in-person component strengthened the selection process and ensured a pool of high-caliber Finalists. As a result the Class of 2012 selection process will include in-person assessments. OPM needs assistance to identify facilities to host the upcoming in-person assessments.</p>
<p>The Class of 2012 PMF assessment is a multi-phased process, with an on-line, unproctored assessment serving as a pre-screen for all applicants. The on-line assessment is a cost-effective method for screening an increasing number of applicants. The in-person assessment will be a more manageable structured interview reserved for a much smaller, select group of semi-finalists in ten possible locations. The in-person process will put semi-finalists through a one-hour highly structured interview. Performance will be scored against a structured rubric by a panel of two-assessors. Finalists will be identified based on a cut-off score determined by the PMF Program office after the assessment.</p>
<p>Therefore, in support of its mission and goals, the PMF program needs to acquire a single facility in the immediate Washington, DC area to host the event to conduct in person assessments of the PMF semi finalist.</p>
<p>OPM intends to award one Firm-Fixed Price contract to the offeror that represents the best value to the government. The period of performance shall be from date of award through December 31, 2011.</p>
<p>Offerors are invited to submit their quotations to the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Contracting Group in response to this notice by 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), September 27, 2011. Quotations submitted in response to this notice shall include the solicitation number in the subject line and be signed, dated and submitted via email to Benjamin.Delaney@opm.gov.</p>
<p>Only e-mailed requests for additional information will be accepted at benjamin.delaney@opm.gov through 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), <br />September 26, 2011. Note that communications with other officials may compromise the competitiveness of this acquisition and result in the cancellation of the requirement.</p>
<p>Note: This is not a solicitation for third party or event planning services. Teaming/ subcontracting arrangements with hotels will be considered non-responsive.</p>
<p>Vendors not registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and not registered in the VETS-100 database at the time the requirement is to be awarded will not be considered. Vendors may register with CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423 or (269) 961-5757, or by accessing www.ccr.gov. Vendors may register with VETS-100 by accessing https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/.</p>

<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>a. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i. Past Performance <br />ii. Price</p>
<p><br />Paragraphs b and c are not applicable as shown below:</p>
<p>b. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>a. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: The Government intends to award contract to offeror which represents best overall value in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history and price will be considered. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to ALL solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. The government reserves the right to reject any offer that does not meet all requirements of the solicitation. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>b. The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106. In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --<br />(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and<br />(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:<br />(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;<br />(C) The Government wide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov ; or<br />(D) Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>c. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: <br />Step 1. Rank all proposals by price. IAW FAR 13.106-2 The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish best overall value to the government. <br />Step 2 - Evaluate all quotes for ability to meet all requirements of the solicitation. Offerors that do not conform fully to the solicitation will not be considered.<br />Step 3 - Review any and /or all past performance information as stated above. <br /><br />d. PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS: The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance rating of "Sufficient Past Performance" or "Limited Past Performance". Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Past Performance", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUFFICIENT PAST PERFORMANCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITED PAST PERFORMANCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN PAST PERFORMANCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>e. When determining relevancy and assigning a past performance confidence rating, the government will consider the type of experience, the amount of experience, and the flexibility of contractor to meet customer needs.</p>
<p>f. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Past Performance," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an "Unknown Past Performance."</p>
<p>g. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Sufficient Past Performance" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Limited Past Performance" or when it is in the best interest of the government to do so.</p>
<p>i. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Sufficient Past Performance" rating, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Sufficient Past Performance" performance rating or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>j. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Surgical Masks. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best price for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR). It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. Vendor is not required to quote for each MMESO AOR. <strong>The Government will make a single selection for each of the following MMESO AORs:</strong>
<p><strong>1. MMESO North</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. MMESO South</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. MMESO West</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. MMESO Pacific</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. MMESO Europe</strong></p>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is December 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. <strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Robert Halliday, Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil and COM 011-49-6221-172108 or Mr. Tom Winkel, Team Leader, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil and COM 011-49-6221-172106.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Surgical Masks. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,971,522.19. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, one eighty-four (84) of the total one hundred and fifty-three (153) line items represent the top six (6) products and accounts for 75.8% ($1,495,329.98) of the total volume in sales, $1,971,522.19, in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. <strong>Estimated annual demand per AOR is approximately MMESO North $455,791.04, MMESO South $524,702.06, MMESO West $474,480.00, MMESO Europe $352,783.78, MMESO Pacific $156,683.28, and Non-MMESO purchases $7,082.03. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company requirements below.</strong></p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Robert Halliday, Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil or Mr. Tom Winkel, Team Leader, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil .</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company criteria listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Europe via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor, who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO RFIAQ, will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</span></strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for each MMESO AOR based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. The MMESO Europe reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning procedures the MMESO CPT validated/approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The ten (10) requirements below must be answered and all supporting documentation provided with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /><br /></strong>1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Surgical Masks products.<br />a. This product line, Surgical Masks, includes latex-free, fog free, flat masks (both procedure and surgical); and specialty masks (both high-filtration flat masks and cone masks), to include at a minimum the specific products listed.<br />1) Procedure Mask, pleated, fluid resistant, with eye shield<br />2) Procedure Mask, pleated, fluid resistant, sub-micron particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) &gt; 95%<br />3) Surgical Mask, fluid resistant, pleated with eye shield<br />4) Surgical Mask, pleated, fluid resistant, bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) &gt; 95%<br />5) Procedure Mask, pleated, PFE &gt; 95%<br />6) Cone Mask, cone, standard<br />*Operational usage items are included in this list of Surgical Masks.<br />b.

Vendor must provide supporting documentation that all products meet the industry production and safety standards used in manufacturing Surgical Masks.<br />5. Vendor must provide supporting documentation indicating their product line of Surgical Masks' fluid penetration resistance, bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE), and sub-micron particulate filtrations efficiency (PFE) accompanies the box of masks and/or is easily identifiable on the mask packaging.<br />6. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Surgical Masks. Vendor must provide the DAPA number or provide documentation the DAPA number has been applied for.<br />7. Vendor must have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Surgical Masks, or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements.<br />8. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative when pricing is requested in Phase III. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for all MMESO AORs. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in Phase III for all products will be disqualified.<br />9. Vendor must indicate country from which each line item is an end product, IAW Trade Agreements Act. Vendors having existing DAPA numbers must also ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country in the DAPA Management System.<br />10.

Vendor will not have an opportunity to change MMESO AOR(s) during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.<br /><br />Phase II Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Acceptability</p>
<p>Clinical Performance Requirements <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO Europe, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after issue of notice, and arrive at the designated addresses for each MTF by 5:00PM local time before the 30th calendar day. Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature/catalog, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II.</strong> Vendor must send the MMESO Europe verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor. Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. The unused samples will not be returned. One (1) box (approximately 25-50 masks) of the items per MTF listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.<br />1. Procedure Mask, pleated, fluid resistant, fog free with eye shield, BFE &gt; 95%<br />2. Surgical Mask, pleated, fluid resistant, fog free with eye shield, BFE &gt; 95%<br />3. Surgical mask, pleated, fluid resistant, fog free, BFE &gt; 95%</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)-Completely Unacceptable, two (2)-Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)-Partially Unacceptable, four (4)-Acceptable, and five (5)-Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified or has not been selected will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Europe and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately fourteen (14) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning procedures the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below: <br />1.&nbsp;FDA/CDRH Safety and effectiveness of medical devices- The surgical/procedure mask is comfortable, does not inhibit breathing and does not get hot during the procedure.&nbsp;The surgical/procedure mask's construction must allow the user a proper fit, but at the same time not being so tight as to inhibit breathability; and it should not get "hot" over long periods of time.<br />2. Health Care Personnel Preference/Patient Safety - The surgical/procedure mask fog-free device is functional.&nbsp;The surgical/procedure mask fog-free device maintains a clear field of vision for health care personnel wearing eye-protection. <br />3. AORN Recommendation III, Recommended Practices for Surgical Attire - The surgical/procedure mask prevents venting.&nbsp;Masks are intended to contain and filter droplets of microorganisms expelled from the mouth and nasopharynx during talking, sneezing, and coughing.<br />4. OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen Standard Reduce the exposure to blood or other infectious materials - The surgical/procedure mask resists penetration of liquids (fluid strike-throughs).&nbsp;The surgical/procedure mask must effectively resist any liquid penetration to protect health care personnel during the operating procedure or procedures performed outside the operating room. <br /><br /><strong>Price Analysis<br /></strong>Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Europe and must be received by 5:00PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement. Pricing should be provided for each MMESO AOR based on a committed volume of 80% of the total volume in sales of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. Vendor quotes will contain separate pricing for each MMESO AOR(s) that was identified in Technical / Company Requirements above. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for each MMESO AOR. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected for each MMESO AOR.</span></strong></p>

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with the Bell-Boeing Joint Program Office for software, sustaining and related technical support of V-22 Operational Test Program Sets (OTPSs), which are comprised of Weapon Replaceable Assembly (WRA) and Shop Replaceable Assembly (SRA) TPSs. (See attached list)&nbsp; These OTPSs will provide test capability for the Units Under Test (UUTs) when used in conjunction with the test station and ancillary equipment and hosted on the Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) and Reconfigurable Transportable Consolidated Automated Support System (RTCASS) at the Intermediate and Depot Levels of maintenance for the V-22 Aircraft.&nbsp; These services are required until the OTPSs are fully transitioned to the Fleet Support Team (FST) from Bell-Boeing in support of the 19 WRA manufacturers. This effort requires in-depth knowledge and expertise in the area of integration with regard to UUT and OTPS development which only Bell-Boeing currently possesses. The Government does not possess the data for the OPTSs and the UUTs are still under development. It is anticipated that a delivery order will be issued under Basic Ordering Agreement N68335-08-G-0002 for this requirement. The Government intends to procure this equipment under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Section 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a response which may be considered by the Government in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for an award of a contract.

It is anticipated that a delivery order will be issued under Basic Ordering Agreement N68335-08-G-0002 for this requirement. This effort will have a base period of performance of one year and two follow-on periods of performance with a duration of one year each.&nbsp; The Government intends to procure this equipment under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Section 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a response which may be considered by the Government in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.

<DESC>The purposes of this modification are to make the following changes in the RFI:
1) Theodore Fiske has been replaced, both as recipient of submissions and as POC, by Saundra Anderson; and
2) the maximum number of attendees per company has been increased from 2 to 4.

TO REGISTER FOR THIS EVENT, THE ATTACHED FILE GPO_IF_SUB_FORM.PDF MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO DANIELLE.MAESTAS@NAVY.MIL AND SAUNDRA ANDERSON@NAVY.MIL

The U.S. Navys Geothermal Program Office (GPO), as the lead office within the Department of Defense (DoD) for the exploration, development and management of geothermal energy resources on all DoD installations, has adopted an aggressive exploration philosophy aimed at identifying and assisting in the development of geothermal energy resources on military installations throughout the United States.
 As a step toward development of new geothermal resources, the GPO is requesting to host an Industry Forum for the purpose of eliciting information from the geothermal industry on the potential for future geothermal development on specified DoD properties; and further on the types of information that industry would require in order to make a reasoned judgment on the commercial viability of those and future unspecified properties. There is no specific contractual requirement related to this forum. Information acquired from contractors under the framework of the forum is for market research solely and may or may not be used in developing future contractual requirements. 

Through its exploration efforts, the GPO has acquired and analyzed a significant body of geological data on a number of potentially promising DoD properties.
 

The GPO has significant expertise in the geological analysis required in the location of potential geothermal sites but requires access to industry knowledge and expertise in the transition to energy production in todays marketplace. 

For the purposes of the forum the GPO will be providing available technical geological/geothermal data for the specified properties for review by industry prior to the event. Industry will be invited to engage the GPO in one-on-one discussions on a broad range of topics related to the process for transition between resource exploration and assessment to development and utilization. Potential topics might range from the types of geological/geothermal data the industry would find most beneficial in assessing economic viability of a site, to the different production technologies that might be appropriate to a site, or to the types of business arrangements that might be necessary in contracting for geothermal site development.

The Fire Safety Program support includes fire/life safety risk assessments, fire protection plan review of planned projects, fire incident investigations, inspection and testing of fire protection systems, and management of a database for fire prevention and fire incident data and will be constant over the duration of the contract. <br><br>The estimated capacity for this current acquisition is $80 million for a period of performance of one year. Due to the unique prior experience and involvement of the current contractors and the anticipated recurring need for electrical inspection and repair services, the actions proposed within this announcement are considered necessary to avoid any lapse in time and to ensure current contract mission is not impacted.  Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's general requirements that includes electrical power systems and inspections would result in a negative impact of life, health, and safety (LHS) hazards of US occupied facilities for USFOR-A and Fire Safety Program support to the USOR-A Safety Office.   <br><br>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<p>The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), Acquisition Management &amp; Support (AM&amp;S), Contracts Operations Division (COD) on behalf of the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) intends to award a firm fixed price contract for Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) membership. OCIO utilizes HIMSS Organizational Affiliate Program as a baseline to assist with:</p>
<p>Executive mission and business activities<br />Provide additional information needed for operations<br />Research new technologies needed to support operations<br />Provide assistance with implementing new processes and technologies to support <br />changing business activities.</p>
<p>Membership to HIMSS would allow OCIO benefits crucial to making effective investments, supporting business objective alignments and the application of enterprise-wide IM/IT standards and processes as part of OCIO's integrated model - the most critical of these being the access to content expertise, professional development, research initiatives, and media vehicles designed to promote information and management systems' contributions to patient care. HIMSS Membership would provide unlimited individual HIMSS memberships; access to HIMSS e-Learning Academy (200 seats); access to over 80 committees, task forces, work groups and special interest groups; and 600 full registrations to the HIMSS 2012 Annual Conference.</p>
<p>This requirement is for a period of performance from December 1, 2011 through November 30, 2012.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is intended as a sole source acquisition to the Healthcare Information and management Systems Society. HIMSS is the only organization who can provide the membership. The NAICS code for the proposed procurement is 813920 and the annual size standard is $14 Million.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted using FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(i)(b). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this notice. The determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.</p>
