<DESC>The Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) East, MCAS Cherry Point, NC has a requirement to procure the upgrade of two (2) Rotor Heads for the Whirl Tower.  It is the intent of the government to procure these supplies from Erickson Air Crane, Inc., 3100 Willow Springs Rd, Medford, OR, on a sole source basis using a Firm Fixed Price contract. Erickson Air Crane, Inc (EAC) is the only known certified Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Joint Aviation Authority (JAA) source that has the technical knowledge and experience with an authorized parts inventory to provide the required supplies in a turn-key, in-house operation without having to outsource for parts and repair services.  Sikorsky is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), but they no longer maintain an inventory of replacement parts and components. The OEM recommended that FRC East use EAC as an authorized source for parts for the Depot?s existing rotor-head assembly.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command has an urgent requirement for a 120mm MP-HE cartridge to be fired from the M1A1/M1A2 tank platforms and will provide a multi-purpose capability.  The cartridge will be a line-of-sight, fin stabilized munition that incorporates three operational modes into a single round.  The all-in-one operational capabilities of this round will reduce logistical requirements by replacing tank rounds currently in stock; thus simplifying ammunition requirements within the M1A1/M1A2 platform. The 120mm MP-HE cartridge will be capable of one extraction remaining in a serviceable condition when the breech is opened manually after chambering throughout the operational temperature range (Threshold) and five extractions (Objective).  It will be safely loaded (onboard the firing platform), chambered, extracted, and re-stowed (if required) IAW TM 9-2350-264-10, Chapter 2, without damage to the round or degradation to performance, and without exposing the crew t!  o an increase in vulnerability compared with existing fielded ammunition (Threshold=Objective).  In addition, the cartridge will fit within the current ammunition compartments within the M1A1/M1A2 tank and must be of such size and weight as to allow the loader to properly handle the round (Threshold = Objective).

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The  Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport (NUWCDIVNPT) intends to acquire, on a sole source basis,  engineering services for the support and maintenance of equipment from OceanWorks nternational Corporation, (OceanWorks) 1225 Keith Rd E, Suite 3 North Vancouver, BC (Canada) V7J 1J3 (CAGE: 3AA44).  The Deep Submergence Systems Program, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (Code 205) and Advanced Undersea Systems Program Office (PMS 394R) have a requirement for engineering services to support and maintain the Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System (SRDRS).  The purpose of the SRDRS is to rescue submariners.  The SRDRS consists of deep depth hardsuits (ADS2000), Launch and Recovery System (LARS), a Pressurized Rescue Module System (PRMS), a shuttle craft and PRMS Mission Support Equipment (MSE).  OceanWorks is the incumbent contractor on the present engineering support and maintenance contract (N66604-02-D-0844).  OceanWorks, or its predecessors in interest, was contractor for prior contracts under which the SRDRS or components was originally acquired (N61331-97-D-0013, 17 Jan 1997; N61331-98-C-0036, 14 Aug 1998; N00024-00-C-4010). The incumbent?s engineering expertise, original source for some system components and consideration of costs comprise the basis of the Government?s intent to negotiate and award on a sole-source basis to OceanWorks a contract for hardware, hardware support, operations support, technical and engineering support services and data to support and maintain the SRDRS.  The items to be acquired include:  Engineering services, Drawings and drawing upgrades, Technical Manuals and associated upgrades, Replacement parts and supply support, Maintenance, installation, repair, refurbishment and troubleshooting, manufacturing of new systems and repair parts, Operations support and Training.  An Indefinite-Quantity CPFF contract is under consideration.  The period of performance is approximately 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012.  The estimated Level of Effort (LOE) is approximately labor  31,750 man hours.   For information on this acquisition contact Ray Smith at 401-832-5939 or at SmithRD@npt.nuwc.navy.mil.  Any challenge to this sole-source action should be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer.  All responsible offers will be considered; see government-wide numbered note 22, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.

NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from MTS Systems Corporation, who is the only responsible source and no other supplier or services will satisfy Agency requirements.  MTS systems are compatible with NASA existing equipments, thus saving the expense and time delay of having to develop new software and hardware from another vendor. Compatibility is important due the complexity of hardware-to-hardware integration and hardware-to-software integration. The impact of using another company would be an substantial duplication of time and money to offer a similar product that would meet these requirements. Through market research MTS is the only company that possesses all of these qualities. Sole Source authority is  FAR	13.106-1.      The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 8, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>*****SEND ALL INFORMATION FOR CONSIDERATION TO CAMERON.D.GREEN AT CAMERON.D.GREEN@NASA.GOV, OR FAX TO 256-544-4401***** NASA/MSFC has a requirement for an ElementCXI Development System. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the item on a sole source basis from ElementCXI, LLC. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1. Product is unique in hardware architecture and utilization approach, along with potential for expansion of capabilities along lines most compatible with NASA’s interests in high speed, low power, robust, scalable, reconfigurable computing resources, with potential for partial or full reconfiguration both during continuous operation of the hardware and after brief interruptions of service in the event of major failures.  Self-checking, cross-checking, and general fault detection and mitigation capacity is a requirement.  No other technology investigated to date has shown the level of potential for addressing all of these areas. 2. Product is an integrated system for both evaluation of the core reconfigurable technology and also its implementation for demonstration in pending research.  3. Attempts to acquire components separately would be very ineffective, as this is the only source of the core technology and the product is to be delivered as an integrated development system for research using the core technology. This Procurement is a sole source. The government intends to acquire a commerical item using FAR part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact: Cameron D. Green at CAMERON.D.GREEN@NASA.GOV, Fax: 256-544-4401 no later than November 4, 2007 at 4:00PM CST.

<SUBJECT>A -- Toward Maximizing the Scientific Value of the Biologic Specimens from the Women?s Health Initiative II
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-BAA-NHLBI-WH-09-01

<DESC>Toward Maximizing the Scientific Value of the Biologic Specimens from the Women's Health Initiative II


The NIH has supported collection of blood samples and clinical data from participants in the three clinical trials and the observational study of the Women?s Health Initiative (WHI) since 1993.  This well-characterized population provides a rare and valuable scientific resource maintained under contracts between NHLBI and the WHI centers.  Promoting optimal use on a national scale of such a resource requires a large and concerted effort which may exceed the research capacities of individual study locations, and of WHI as a whole.  The NHLBI and the researchers it supports have a responsibility to the public in general, and the scientific community in particular, to encourage the most rapid scientific progress possible using these resources.  In order to take full advantage of such resources and to maximize their research value, it is important that samples and data collected with public funds be made available, with the least amount of restrictions, to the largest possible number of qualified investigators in a timely manner.

The NHLBI and NIH programs were reviewed to determine whether existing projects will satisfy the requirement, and the proposed activity was discussed with key staff in NHLBI and other NIH Institutes to determine that this BAA does not replicate other efforts.  The WHI resource is unique in its scope, focus on diseases of older women, ethic and racial diversity, and in particular in that it includes several large randomized controlled clinical trials which are capable of yielding information that cannot be obtained from observational studies.  Care will be taken to ensure that the investigations under this BAA will not duplicate those already performed by the WHI investigators and their colleagues.

The original WHI study population included 161,808 postmenopausal women in the United States, 68,132 (42%) of whom were randomized to one or more components of the clinical trial (CT), and 93,676 (58%) of whom were enrolled in the observational study (OS) between 1993 and 1998.  Recruitment criteria included being 50-79 years of age, being post-menopausal, and planning to live in the area of a given Clinical Center (CC) for three years, with specific exclusionary criteria for the Dietary Modification (DM) and Hormone Therapy (HT) Trial components. Specific study goals were set for ethnic distribution (20% minority women in the CT) and age distribution (30% for 50-59 years of age; 45% for 60-69; 25% for 70-79).  The original cohort was followed until March 31, 2005, after which subjects were invited to enroll in the WHI Extension Study from 2005 to 2010. As of August 2006 there were 115,273 women (77% of eligibles) enrolled in the Extension Study, during which ascertainment of outcomes (including activities of daily life) has continued together with limited exposure data on use of hormone therapy, calcium/vitamin D supplements, and 24-hour recall of food intake (in a subset).

This acquisition will employ a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to seek proposals that will maximize the scientific yield from the biologic resource and associated participant exposure and outcome data in the Women?s Health Initiative (WHI), by soliciting the best ideas for laboratory-based research studies to apply to the WHI biologic resource.  This second solicitation follows on a first solicitation issued in January, 2006.  WHI collected extensive information on multiple outcomes, including any disease leading to overnight hospitalization, cancers, self-report of a number of additional conditions, measures of cognition/dementia, sleep, and functional status, amongst others. For this second BAA solicitation, proposals utilizing the data on any of the phenotypes or groups of phenotypes will be considered.  It is anticipated that the research programs funded by this BAA will include applications of genomics, proteomics, and other laboratory investigations to the existing frozen samples of DNA, serum, plasma, red blood cells, and urine.  The BAA will not fund new data collection and will make use of existing biologic specimens.
 
In general, the BAA seeks innovative technologies that enable comprehensive, yet efficient, investigation of sets of markers associated with disease outcomes or treatment effects, or of groups of mediators that might substantively explain the pathway of exposure or treatment effects on disease. For example, genomic studies might include whole-genome and haplotype approaches and studies of sets of functional genes with related effects on an outcome.  Studies that combine information from genes and gene products in the form of blood proteins could help to elucidate pathways.  Studies on serum or plasma might include multiplex assays of a panel of markers, for example adipokines or cytokines, which allow a large number of markers to be tested using a modest amount of sample.  On the other hand, focused studies on a more limited number of candidate genes or candidate markers will be considered if there are reasonably strong data supporting large effects from these individual markers that need to be confirmed in a large dataset, and their validation has potential public health implications. 

Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) are used by agencies to fulfill their requirements for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state-of-the art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific solution.  Proposals received under this BAA will be evaluated in accordance with evaluation criteria as specified in the solicitation, through a peer review process.  Proposals will not be evaluated against a specific Government need, as in the case of a conventional request for proposals (RFP), as they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.

Projects that will utilize this instrument include: in vitro angiogenesis assays including vessel formation and interaction of proteins that play a role in directing vessel formation, in vitro differentiation assays (associated with angiogenesis), in vivo and in vitro assays of neuroendocrine development and carcinogenesis, in vitro characterization of siRNA and drug mediated toxicity, characterization of antibody-antigen interactions in 3-D assay platforms, and protein: protein interaction in tissue microarrays. 

The specific projects with which the JOFOC is associated are primarily imaging of cells and tissues through the use of fluorescent tagged proteins, antibodies and small molecules, or fluorescent dyes know to selectively interact with specific cellular proteins or organelles. The fluorescent probes can then be visualized using the Zeiss LSM 510 microscope. In addition to direct visualization of these molecules the Zeiss LSM 510 meta is capable of analyzing the interaction of fluorescent tagged molecules via fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) analysis, as well as spectral acquisition.

The Zeiss 510 Meta laser scanning microscope (LSM) will be and upgrade to existing equipment which is a Zeiss LSM5 Pascal, thus allowing trade-in credit for portions of the old equipment. In addition because of the diversity of projects a flexible, upgradeable inverted laser scanning confocal microscope is desired. The instrument must offer the following features: 

-Inverted microscope frame 
-Transmitted light path/ visible illumination (white light)
-Fluorescent (mercury lamp) light source and path
-Four lasers, at 405, 440-514 range 561 and 633 nm wavelengths 
-Integrated software control of lightpath, laser scanning and image analysis
-Z-motor with 10nm step size
-Objectives, suitable for fluorescent imaging	
-10X, 20X, 40X dry
-63X oil
-Three Confocal detections - 2 R/FL detectors and one polychromatic detector
-User accessible and changeable fluorescent filters
-FRET Imaging Capable
-FRAP Imaging Capable


PART II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

1.	Statute

Statute: 13.106-1(b) and 13.501-1(a)

(a) Solicitation from a single source.  

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreement, or industrial mobilization).

(2)	For Sole source acquisition of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.
	
No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.   

2.	Justification:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   8(a) Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for Central Issue Warehouses (CIW) in the Northwest Region (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY) The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be David Deleranko, 817-886-1087; or by e-mail at david.m.deleranko@usace.army.mil. FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presenc e Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to sup port ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardi zation (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has be en assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT) facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.   SCOPE OF WORK:   Central Issue Warehouse (CIW) or other similar facilities:  The primary mission of the CIWs is to provide a single point for receipt, storage, issue, exchange, and return of all authorized organizational clothing and individual equipment items at the spec ified United States Army Installation.  CIW facilities provide storage capabilities combined with office space, used in the administration of issuing soldiers equipment as needed.  The facilities support open storage for deployment functions as necessary by the Army Unit occupying the building.  The functional and operational requirements of the CIW require that the design be based on the characteristics of the material being handled and stored, the volume and flow pattern through the facility, and the inv entory pattern.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a resu lt of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may sub mit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals i n accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.   In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criter ia described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Gover nment, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Govern ment will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.   The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Appr oach   Phase II  Volume I: Building Functional and Aesthetics; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design; and Sustainability Requirements.  Volume II:  Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Past Performance on Utilization of Sm all Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price.   Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 11/13/2007under solicitation number W9126G-08-R-0008.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 12/13/2007.  (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  If the Government elects to conduct a  Pre-Proposal Conference, details regarding the Conference will be provided in the solicitation.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), wh ich corresponds to SIC 1542.  The Small Business Size Standard is $31 Million.     SATOC:  If the Contracting Officer determines that the firms proposing under this solicitation are not capable of being awarded a SATOC for the proposed estimated maximum, the Government reserves the right to award the SATOC for less than the capacity stat ed or award the initial task as a c-type, stand alone contract and advertise another solicitation for the remaining capacity.  Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.   Once the contracts under this solicitation are awarded and there is duplicative coverage for this facility type in the same region, any requirement less than $15 million will be evaluated first for advertisement under any set-aside contract or pool of co ntracts prior.  The Government will consider the current workload under the set-aside contract, performance on previous task orders, and the small business firms ability to obtain additional boding prior to making a determination.   The total estimated contract capacity is $1,400,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 2 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 4 8 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration that stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  The minimum guarantee will be $ 5K.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Fu nds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.   The minimum task order limitation is $5K.  The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $533,000.  The maximum combination of orders is $710,000.  The Governmen t reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.   The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening.

These goals reflect the Fiscal Year (FY) 07 requirements.  If the goals are increased in FY 08, the Offeror will be required to submit a subcontracting plan that is accordance with the revised goals.  Plans and specifications will not be provided in a  hard paper copy.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis seeking potential vendors that have the experience and capability to fulfill the attached requirement.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITAITON IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

This sources sought announcement is in support of market research being conducted by the National Institutes of Health to identify small business sources (including small business programs:  8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veteran) that are capable of performing the requirements identified in the Description and in the paragraphs below.  The intended procurement will be classified under 2007 NAICS 541712 (previously 541710 under the 2002 NAICS).

The Primate Aging Database (PAD) is a searchable database developed to allow analysis of age-related traits in non-human primates (NHP).  Currently, the database contains data from 20 species at 11 different institutions, comprising over 3000 individual animals and 500,000 data points.  About 80% of the data is from rhesus monkeys.  Current data fields are primarily lifespan, body composition parameters, and blood chemistry parameters, although addition of other parameters is possible.  The PAD is useful for analyses of species differences in normal aging processes, studies on biomarkers of normal aging and age-related pathologies, and determination of baseline levels in geriatric NHP colonies.  The PAD was written on a Microsoft Access platform and was converted to a web-based platform under the current contract, N01-AG-3-1014.

The purpose of the Primate Aging Database (PAD) is to compile data on biological measurements in non-human primates (NHP) from as many primate colonies as possible and disseminate this information to the scientific community.  This will provide a new research resource to allow investigators to analyze the effect of aging on many biomarkers with the goal of identifying parameters that define the aging process.  It will serve the added function of providing normative values for researchers and veterinarians providing care to aged NHP, allowing them to better assess the health of their charges.  This resource will promote advances in aging research without requiring additional animals since it will bring together a large amount of data generated by many different institutions and investigators.

The objective of this contract is to host and maintain PAD on the Contractor?s server, provide it to investigators in the research community, provide technical assistance with its use, and continue to add data on biological measurements in non-human primates.

The Government will provide to the Contractor the PAD and software that have already been developed.  All data in the database, the software, and the codebook shall remain property of the Government.

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, and equipment (except for those to be furnished by the government as specified elsewhere in this contract) to perform the work required by this contract as set forth below.

Specifically, the Contractor shall:

1.  Transfer PAD and the PAD customer database to a secure server at the Contractor?s facility and maintain a back-up copy, provide all maintenance and repairs to keep the server functioning properly.  A transition period of no more than one month should be proposed, and the PAD shall be off-line for no more than 48 hours during the transition period.

Note:  offerors should provide details on the transfer of the database and how the transition period will be structured.

2.  Provide the PAD to investigators in the research community via the password protected website.  All costs associated with distribution of the PAD to investigators shall be borne by the contract.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis seeking potential vendors that have the experience and capability to fulfill the attached requirement.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITAITON IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

This sources sought announcement is in support of market research being conducted by the National Institutes of Health to identify small business sources (including small business programs:  8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veteran) that are capable of performing the requirements identified in the Description and in the paragraphs below.  The intended procurement will be classified under 2007 NAICS 541712 (previously 541710 under the 2002 NAICS).

The Primate Aging Database (PAD) is a searchable database developed to allow analysis of age-related traits in non-human primates (NHP).  Currently, the database contains data from 20 species at 11 different institutions, comprising over 3000 individual animals and 500,000 data points.  About 80% of the data is from rhesus monkeys.  Current data fields are primarily lifespan, body composition parameters, and blood chemistry parameters, although addition of other parameters is possible.  The PAD is useful for analyses of species differences in normal aging processes, studies on biomarkers of normal aging and age-related pathologies, and determination of baseline levels in geriatric NHP colonies.  The PAD was written on a Microsoft Access platform and was converted to a web-based platform under the current contract, N01-AG-3-1014.

The purpose of the Primate Aging Database (PAD) is to compile data on biological measurements in non-human primates (NHP) from as many primate colonies as possible and disseminate this information to the scientific community.  This will provide a new research resource to allow investigators to analyze the effect of aging on many biomarkers with the goal of identifying parameters that define the aging process.  It will serve the added function of providing normative values for researchers and veterinarians providing care to aged NHP, allowing them to better assess the health of their charges.  This resource will promote advances in aging research without requiring additional animals since it will bring together a large amount of data generated by many different institutions and investigators.

The objective of this contract is to host and maintain PAD on the Contractor?s server, provide it to investigators in the research community, provide technical assistance with its use, and continue to add data on biological measurements in non-human primates.

The Government will provide to the Contractor the PAD and software that have already been developed.  All data in the database, the software, and the codebook shall remain property of the Government.

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, and equipment (except for those to be furnished by the government as specified elsewhere in this contract) to perform the work required by this contract as set forth below.

Specifically, the Contractor shall:

1.  Transfer PAD and the PAD customer database to a secure server at the Contractor?s facility and maintain a back-up copy, provide all maintenance and repairs to keep the server functioning properly.  A transition period of no more than one month should be proposed, and the PAD shall be off-line for no more than 48 hours during the transition period.

Note:  offerors should provide details on the transfer of the database and how the transition period will be structured.

2.  Provide the PAD to investigators in the research community via the password protected website.  All costs associated with distribution of the PAD to investigators shall be borne by the contract.  As liaison with the research community, the Contractor shall be responsible for evaluating all applications for a password to PAD to ensure the users are legitimate researchers and for informing investigators of the publication policy as set forth by the PAD Steering Committee and communicated to the Contractor by the Project Officer.

3.  Provide technical assistance to investigators using PAD, through one-on-one consultations and refinements to the codebook.

4.  Fix any reported problems with the PAD software and the hardware housing the database.  Any significant problems affecting utilization of the database by investigators shall be reported to the Project Officer immediately.  The Contractor shall keep a log of all significant problems encountered by investigators attempting to access PAD, and report these problems in the semi-annual progress reports (4.A. below).

5.  Maintain viewer controls on access to data.  Data in PAD is available to users as means, medians and graphs, but individual data points are not identified.  Only submitters are allowed to see their own raw data.  The Project Officer will inform the Contractor of any changes in the policy on data access that the PAD Steering Committee implements.  The Contractor does not have the authority to make changes to data access without the authorization of the Project Officer.

6.  Solicit new data from the research community as directed by the Project Officer, enter the data into PAD, and perform quality control analyses of the data.  Data will be solicited from institutions that have already contributed data to PAD, as updates and data on new animals becomes available, and from new sources identified by the Project Officer or by the Contractor and approved by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall be responsible for informing investigators of the data ownership policy, as developed by the PAD Steering Committee and provided by the Project Officer.

Note: the format in which the data will be submitted will vary from source to source.  Some data will be submitted electronically in a format compatible with electronic transfer into the database; other data will be submitted as paper copies that need to be manually entered.

7.  Maintain a list of all recipients of the passwords to the database and all publications resulting from the use of PAD.

8.  Maintain a back-up copy of the database, codebook and software to protect against accidental loss.  The back up should be up-dated every week and stored off-site or on-site in a fireproof safe.

9.  Provide security for all computers that contain copies of the database and all supporting information required by this statement of work, including locking down computers and using password protection for access to the computer files containing information relating to the database and investigators using the database.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
Dual Digital Autopilot System for KC-135R/T and Special Purpose Aircraft

PURPOSE
The 827th ACSG Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost, schedule, and performance parameters to remove the existing Autopilot System (ASW-48) and install a replacement Dual Digital Autopilot System and associated components (hardware, software, etc).

DESCRIPTION
The KC-135R/T and Special Purpose aircraft Autopilot system generates low reliability and an undesired number of disconnects during refueling operations.  A proposed replacement autopilot system should use Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) equipment to the maximum extent possible.  The modified aircraft must meet current and future FAA and ICAO requirements including, but not limited to:  Worldwide capability and certification for extended over-the-water operations; enable Required Navigation Performance (RNP) of 0.15 (total system accuracy of 0.15 nautical miles 95% of the flying time) in terminal areas (meeting performance/certification of RNP 0.15 may require additional systems modifications at a future time); and meet Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) requirements and emerging Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.

The proposed dual digital autopilot must address the following capabilities:

- Continual crosschecking 
- Vertical navigation (e.g. provide the ability to bring the aircraft to approach from cruise altitude) while providing airspeed or throttle queues to the aircrew for airspeed deviation through annunciation (there are no auto-throttles on the KC-135)
- Replacement of the Angle of Attack (AoA) transmitters and indicator providing digital inputs to the autopilot and flight director systems
- Autopilot system should receive and provide digital outputs to all associated systems with the exception of those requiring servo, synchro, or other analog signal inputs
- When installed, the system will be able to accept aircrew-selectable air refueling receiver type profiles to allow autopilot to compensate for incoming receiver aircraft, reducing the number of un-commanded autopilot disconnects
- Ability to store and provide any detected faults and provide maintenance crews with fault verbiage
- Dual autopilot control heads with capability to integrate autopilot and flight director functions together (desire)
- Provide dual control surface sensing at the control surfaces (tail)
- Autopilot system Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) protection
- Potentially perform yaw control


NOTE:  Must maintain software interoperability with the existing avionics systems components and software configuration to ensure the ability to interface with existing systems w/o degrading current capability.

RESPONSE
Responses shall address:
1.	Performance parameters, to include design, installation, reliability, maintainability data, and testing.
2.	Program Estimated Cost information (rough order of magnitude)
3.	Delivery schedule/product availability
4.	Any alternatives/suggestions that satisfy airworthiness requirements, to include cost and schedule

Interested firms should also include the following in their response:

-Company Name and Address
-CAGE Code (if available)
-Point of Contact
-Size of Business (i.e. Large/small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) concern, Minority-owned business)
-U.S. or Foreign Owned Entity

Submit response (along with any supporting documentation) directly to:
827th ACSG/PK

The qualification statements received in response to announcement R-08-0001 will be considered by the evaluation board for corrected announcement MCCHAE-08-R-0001 as received unless revised or withdrawn by the firms providing those qualification files.  Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services Contract:  The Air Force intends to award two (2) IDIQ contracts for Multi Disciplinary Architect-Engineering Services for Commercial, Industrial, and Residential type design activities at McChord AFB, Washington.  The closing date for the receipt of responses is 2:00 PM local time (PST) on November 30, 2007.  The Multi-discipline A-E design services for McChord AFB, Washington are to be procured in accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and FAR Part 36.  The Multi Disciplinary A-E Services shall include the primary capabilities for Architectural, Civil, Structural, Electrical, Mechanical, and Environmental (including performance of Hazardous Material Surveys) and including ?Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design? (LEED) Professional Accreditation in support of Air Force Sustainable Design and Development Policy.  A-E Services shall include fact-finding, site surveys, investigations, and economic analysis in support of project design requirements; the production of design documents in support of executing construction projects.  The IDIQ contract will have a maximum monetary limit of $750,000 per year/period, with a minimum delivery order guarantee of $5,000 for the first task order during the first year.  The contract award and starting date will be approximately May 15, 2008 for a period not to exceed 12-months with four option periods not to exceed 12-months each which may be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  Work will be issued by means of a negotiated firm fixed-priced task orders.  An option period may be exercised when the contract amount for the base period or subsequent option periods has been exhausted or nearly exhausted.  The contract rates for the basic period shall begin on the date of the contract award and shall continue for 365 calendar days.  Typical investigative and design services shall be performed to support new construction; additions to existing facilities; remodel/renovation of existing facilities; alteration and repair of miscellaneous base wide infrastructure utilities and services such as water, sewer, electrical, communications, steam lines, fuel storage and transportation systems, airfield pavement projects, and integration of energy monitoring and control systems.

The design of the fire alarm and suppression systems shall be performed by ?National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies? certified engineer.  The following factors will be evaluated as the basis for selection for award of a contract.  The following are the Primary Criteria used in the evaluation, each being of equal value: (a) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (b) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services including (LEED) certification; and (c) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recycled/recovered materials.  The Secondary Criteria are; (a) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project with a declining point value given the farther a firm is located from McChord AFB and (b) the Volume of work DOD previously awarded to the firm within the last 12 months with the object of effecting equitable distribution of DOD A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.  The Secondary Criteria are of lesser importance and evaluation point value than the Primary Criteria.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541310.  For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross receipts are $4.5 million or less.  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 19.7 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan or that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov/.  Interested firms possessing the capabilities to perform this work shall submit three (3) copies of the Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications for the prime firm and all consultants to arrive at 62nd CONS/LGCA, PO Box 4178, 100 Col Joe Jackson Blvd, Suite 2001, McChord AFB, WA 98438-0178 no later than the response date indicated above.

<DESC>BAA 0701AEDCPKP:  The Department of Defense Test Resource Management Center (DTRMC), through Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) is soliciting research proposals in the area of hypersonics testing and evaluation/science and technology (T&E/S&T) development.   DTRMC seeks innovative proposals that will allow improved test and evaluation of current and future hypersonics systems over the next 10 to 15 years.  The goal is not to develop hypersonic flight systems or subsystems in this solicitation, but to investigate improved ground and flight test facilities, techniques and test methodologies that are needed to support hypersonic system/subsystem development.  This program does not support basic research, but rather the application and extension of technology to produce and understand a real or simulated flight environment.  The range of interest covers all hypersonic flight, both sustained flight in the atmosphere and the test environment of reentry vehicles.  TRMC seeks advances in hypersonic and related technologies in the areas (not in priority): 

(1)       Open air range technologies Planned high speed and hypersonic flight tests are in need of large controlled range spaces, innovative diagnostic technologies and flight test techniques. The specific needs within these range technology topics are detailed below. 
a.	Non intrusive flight diagnostics This task seeks to expand the amount of data taken from a flight test article.  Points of interest include thrust determination, thermal protection systems effectiveness, and miniaturization. Developed systems should be tested in ground facilities with the goal of possible demonstration in a flight test. 
b.	Autonomous flight termination system Operating a hypersonic system over land presents risks especially with test articles that veer off planned trajectories.  This effort seeks a system that could reliably and safely terminate a test vehicle during any portion of a flight test. Demonstration of the proposed methodology via ground test or flight tests is encouraged. 
c.	Flight test techniques High Speed and Hypersonic Systems will be tested over vast areas of land and water.  This task seeks to develop innovative flight test methods to reduce the test footprint and improve data quality over large areas of vastly differing terrain.

(2)	Test methodologies and evaluation of freejet test articles Current high speed and hypersonic freejet test techniques lead to thrust measurements with a high level of uncertainty. This effort seeks methodology, for use in DoD test facilities similar to APTU or ASTF, which could obtain high accuracy, thrust measurements from a ramjet or scramjet engine in a freejet test. Demonstration in the appropriate test environment is encouraged.

(3)	Propulsion system scaling laws As the size of high speed hypersonic propulsion systems increase, large scale propulsion test facilities (in the near term) will likely not be available in time to support technology developers. One means to alleviate some of the facility size requirements is to implement scaling parameters for propulsion tests. This enables sub-scale test articles to run in smaller tunnels yet output properties applicable for larger systems.  The objective of this solicitation is to look at current scaling methods, select those applicable to hypersonic propulsion, and demonstrate these methods via actual test articles supporting technology programs.  

(4)	Long runtime clean air true temperature test capabilities above Mach 8 Current propulsion test facilities are incapable of producing hypersonic, true temperature clean air flow beyond Mach 8 for seconds.   Though the capability to achieve flows of much higher speeds exists, it is typically in the sub-second scale.  This effort should investigate enabling technologies that could lead to a Mach 8+ facility.

(5)	Modeling and simulation data integration Data from ground and flight tests and results of CFD codes are often collected and never integrated into Integrated Test and Evaluation (IT&E) tools and methods.  This task seeks to create a comprehensive and expandable data management process that can select and store applicable hypersonic test and modeling data, providing a method for the test and analyses engineers to integrate these tools into the IT&E for the development of High Speed and Hypersonic systems. 

(6)	Arc heater diagnosis of high enthalpy flow Arc Heater test capabilities are critical for the future development of thermal protection systems.  The current suites of sensors that diagnostic tools utilize in arc heater tests are limited. This effort seeks to develop sensors and techniques to characterize and sample high enthalpy flows as well as capture surface temperatures of arc heater test articles. 

(7)	Environmental testing Planned hypersonic vehicles that operate in the earth atmosphere will likely encounter liquid and solid hydrometeors.  Existing test facilities have been used to simulate liquid hydrometeors in the appropriate flight environments.  This task seeks to understand the technology needed to simulate solid water flight conditions such as hail and snow.  Successful proposals would demonstrate methods in relevant test facilities. 

(8)	Flight fuel characteristics simulation and testing Fuel will be used as coolant on a hypersonic vehicle and will arrive at the engine with changes in temperature and structure from that carried in the fuel tank.  Test facilities need to provide this same fuel state to test engines.  With emphasis on hydrocarbon fuels and existing data (where possible), evaluate the range of cooling schemes being proposed in flight, determine the conditions of the fuel reaching the flight engine, study and determine the best method of duplicating the process in the ground test facility, and recommend appropriate hardware required to develop fuel simulation test capabilities suitable to a wide range of test articles. The goal of this solicitation is to provide validated criteria for a prototype test rig that could be verified in an appropriate test capability.

(9)	Evaluation of run-time on data suitability Mid to far term testing requirements point to test capabilities beyond Mach 8.  Currently no medium to long duration hypersonic propulsion tunnels exist that can operate at these Mach numbers.  One means to mitigate this gap is to use existing facilities and compare the results from short (minutes) duration tunnels to impulse (millisecond) tunnels.  This effort seeks techniques and solutions, from existing data (where possible), that correlate impulse and short duration tunnel results with longer duration tunnels. The objective is to demonstrate the applicability of hypersonic propulsion data from impulse facilities, with the intent to accept such data at higher Mach conditions were longer runtime data may not be available in the near-term. Solicitations should also include the proposed methodologies for obtaining non-existing data and means to validate results.

(10)	Nozzle Development Hypersonic vehicle design requires the highest quality data for validation of vehicle aerodynamic/aerothermodynamic CFD simulations.  This requirement has put a new emphasis on wind tunnel data quality and the influence of nozzle flow quality and uniformity on this data.  This task seeks to improve and demonstrate new or existing tools for purpose of future nozzle design and/or the improvement and demonstration of new or existing tools used to interpret nozzle flow parameters.

(11)	Other Technologies This topic area allows offerors to identify potential technology development opportunities not identified in previous topic areas, but may be beneficial and critical to the development of technologies to enable rapid HSH T&E capability development.

PROJECT SCOPE:  Awards totaling approximately $1-$2M are expected to be made in FY08.  Increased funding levels are anticipated to occur in the following fiscal years.  Prospective proposers should be aware that there is no certainty in the funding or level of effort.  

GENERAL INFORMATION:  Proposals should address development and/or operational test and evaluation technologies.  DTRMC strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities.  Teaming among academia, industry, and/or government partners is encouraged; however, this is no a requirement.  Projects with strong transition plans to DoD T&E ground or flight test facilities or with DoD T&E facility participation will receive preference.  Because awards may be made in which contractors expect to access or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public, the contracts will contain DFARS Clause 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information.  This requirement will be in subcontracts as well.  Projects will be awarded in phases with the later phases being funded in FY08 or later and will be contingent on funds availability, merit of performance and previous phases, and anticipated future T&E requirements for the technologies being addressed.  In order to minimize the magnitude of the proposal preparation and review process, a proposal abstract of no more than 15 pages total should be submitted by 8 June 2007.  Each proposal should specify the benefits to U.S. military service and the executing organization with subcontractors (where applicable), and their specific roles.  The proposal should briefly describe the out-year effort beyond completion of the Phase I effort.  Each proposal should address a specific T&E hypersonic need.

Each proposer and subcontractor will be required to submit written verification stating they are aware of their responsibility to have DoD approval for public release of information pertaining to the proposed project (including technical reports, papers, and presentations) as required by DoD regulations regarding t he dissemination of militarily critical technologies and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

EVALUATION:  Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria:  (1)  overall scientific and technical merit, (2)  relevance to current T&E hypersonic technology test requirements not addressed in other DoD programs, (3) offeror?s capabilities and related experience, (4) cost realism of proposed effort and (5) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition to T&E application and/or to DoD T&E facilities.  Upon review, the Hypersonic Test Working Group, through AEDC, will respond to proposal abstracts with a recommendation to submit or not to submit a full proposal and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposals and proposal abstracts should be submitted on CD-ROM in .PDF format and forwarded to:  AEDC/PKP, Attn:  Sue Tate, 100 Kindel Drive Suite A332, Arnold AFB TN  37389-1332.

<SUBJECT>A -- Management of the Primate Aging Database
<SOLNBR>NIHAG2007001
<RESPDATE>091307
<CONTACT>Louis Kuta, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-8024, Fax 301-402-0178, Email kutal@od.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis seeking potential vendors that have the experience and capability to fulfill the attached requirement.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITAITON IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

This sources sought announcement is in support of market research being conducted by the National Institutes of Health to identify small business sources (including small business programs:  8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veteran) that are capable of performing the requirements identified in the Description and in the paragraphs below.  The intended procurement will be classified under 2007 NAICS 541712 (previously 541710 under the 2002 NAICS).

The Primate Aging Database (PAD) is a searchable database developed to allow analysis of age-related traits in non-human primates (NHP).  Currently, the database contains data from 20 species at 11 different institutions, comprising over 3000 individual animals and 500,000 data points.  About 80% of the data is from rhesus monkeys.  Current data fields are primarily lifespan, body composition parameters, and blood chemistry parameters, although addition of other parameters is possible.  The PAD is useful for analyses of species differences in normal aging processes, studies on biomarkers of normal aging and age-related pathologies, and determination of baseline levels in geriatric NHP colonies.  The PAD was written on a Microsoft Access platform and was converted to a web-based platform under the current contract, N01-AG-3-1014.

The purpose of the Primate Aging Database (PAD) is to compile data on biological measurements in non-human primates (NHP) from as many primate colonies as possible and disseminate this information to the scientific community.  This will provide a new research resource to allow investigators to analyze the effect of aging on many biomarkers with the goal of identifying parameters that define the aging process.  It will serve the added function of providing normative values for researchers and veterinarians providing care to aged NHP, allowing them to better assess the health of their charges.  This resource will promote advances in aging research without requiring additional animals since it will bring together a large amount of data generated by many different institutions and investigators.

The objective of this contract is to host and maintain PAD on the Contractor?s server, provide it to investigators in the research community, provide technical assistance with its use, and continue to add data on biological measurements in non-human primates.

The Government will provide to the Contractor the PAD and software that have already been developed.  All data in the database, the software, and the codebook shall remain property of the Government.

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, and equipment (except for those to be furnished by the government as specified elsewhere in this contract) to perform the work required by this contract as set forth below.

Specifically, the Contractor shall:

1.  Transfer PAD and the PAD customer database to a secure server at the Contractor?s facility and maintain a back-up copy, provide all maintenance and repairs to keep the server functioning properly.  A transition period of no more than one month should be proposed, and the PAD shall be off-line for no more than 48 hours during the transition period.

Note:  offerors should provide details on the transfer of the database and how the transition period will be structured.

2.  Provide the PAD to investigators in the research community via the password protected website.  All costs associated with distribution of the PAD to investigators shall be borne by the contract.  As liaison with the research community, the Contractor shall be responsible for evaluating all applications for a password to PAD to ensure the users are legitimate researchers and for informing investigators of the publication policy as set forth by the PAD Steering Committee and communicated to the Contractor by the Project Officer.

3.  Provide technical assistance to investigators using PAD, through one-on-one consultations and refinements to the codebook.

4.  Fix any reported problems with the PAD software and the hardware housing the database.  Any significant problems affecting utilization of the database by investigators shall be reported to the Project Officer immediately.  The Contractor shall keep a log of all significant problems encountered by investigators attempting to access PAD, and report these problems in the semi-annual progress reports (4.A. below).

5.  Maintain viewer controls on access to data.  Data in PAD is available to users as means, medians and graphs, but individual data points are not identified.  Only submitters are allowed to see their own raw data.  The Project Officer will inform the Contractor of any changes in the policy on data access that the PAD Steering Committee implements.  The Contractor does not have the authority to make changes to data access without the authorization of the Project Officer.

6.  Solicit new data from the research community as directed by the Project Officer, enter the data into PAD, and perform quality control analyses of the data.  Data will be solicited from institutions that have already contributed data to PAD, as updates and data on new animals becomes available, and from new sources identified by the Project Officer or by the Contractor and approved by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall be responsible for informing investigators of the data ownership policy, as developed by the PAD Steering Committee and provided by the Project Officer.

Note: the format in which the data will be submitted will vary from source to source.  Some data will be submitted electronically in a format compatible with electronic transfer into the database; other data will be submitted as paper copies that need to be manually entered.

7.  Maintain a list of all recipients of the passwords to the database and all publications resulting from the use of PAD.

8.  Maintain a back-up copy of the database, codebook and software to protect against accidental loss.  The back up should be up-dated every week and stored off-site or on-site in a fireproof safe.

9.  Provide security for all computers that contain copies of the database and all supporting information required by this statement of work, including locking down computers and using password protection for access to the computer files containing information relating to the database and investigators using the database.

10.  Advertise the PAD by demonstrations at scientific meetings.  Contract personnel shall attend and sponsor a booth at 2-3 scientific meetings per year, to be approved in advance by the Project Officer, and provide directed, hands-on demonstrations of the PAD.

The period of performance will be based on continued scientific interest in this resource.  Therefore, a contract consisting of one base year and four option years is suggested.  The anticipated start date is September 1, 2008 continuing through August 31, 2013.

Semi-annual progress reports shall be delivered to the Project Officer (1 copy) and the Contracting Officer (1 copy) within thirty (30) calendar days of the end of each six month period of the contract.  The initial report shall be submitted for the first full six months of the contract performance including any fractional part of the initial month.  Thereafter, the reporting period shall consist of six full calendar months.  A semi-annual report will not be required for the period when the final report is due.  Semi-annual progress reports shall include any changes in Contractor personnel, the number of staff-hours committed to the contract project for the reporting period, the source and number of data points entered into the database for each species, a summary of revisions to the codebook completed during the reporting period, a list of investigators who received login passwords to the database, a list of publications resulting from use of the database, and any technical problems reported by investigators and how they were addressed.

A final report shall be submitted to the Project Officer (1 copy) and the Contracting Officer (1 copy) on or before completion of this contract.  The final report shall include a summation of the work performed under the entire contract period of performance, including the number of data points entered for each species, investigators who received the database, publication resulting from use of the database, and any technical problems reported by investigators and how they were addressed.  Two (2) copies (CDs) of the most up-to-date version of the database shall be submitted to the Project Officer with the final report.

Interested small businesses are invited to submit a capability statement addressing the ability to satisfy the requirement.  The capability statement should reference sources sought synopsis number NIHAG2007001 and should be no longer than 15 pages in length (personnel qualifications are not included in page count) and shall include the following:  (1) name and address of the company; size standard and small business program status of the company as listed under www.ccr.gov; (2) point of contact with name, title, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address; (3) DUNS number; (4) contractor's capability statement that demonstrates the firm's ability, knowledge, and experience specific to the requirements set forth in the draft statement of work; (5) lists of three clients to whom similar types of services have been previously provided within the last three years to include contract number, dollar value, and name and telephone number of point of contact; and (6) qualifications and experience of any key personnel likely to perform directly under any resultant contract.

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS.

Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether sufficient small businesses possess the experience, expertise, and qualifications to ensure competition under a set-aside acquisition.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested firms are to mail two copies of their capability statement to the address identified in this synopsis no later than 2 pm EST September 13, 2007.

<DESC>Request for Information:  Subject to final approval, The Department of the Treasury?s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau?s Advertising, Labeling and Formulation Division (ALFD), intends to make an award for research services providing an annual listing of existing advertisements,  and digital submission to TTB of said list (in part). The Government intends to award a contract for a base period of one year plus four option years, renewed annually.

Mission:  TTB?s mission is to collect alcohol and tobacco excise taxes; to ensure that these products are labeled, advertised, and marketed in accordance with the law; to administer the laws and regulations in a manner that protects the consumer and revenue, and promotes voluntary compliance.

Nature and Description of Action:  The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has previously determined that TTB has need of compliance checks on the authorized labeling of Beverage Commodities (Distilled Spirits, Wine or Beer), and therefore has a requirement for the listing of advertisements placed in four media types.
The contractor will be asked to produce a list of advertisements that have appeared in each of the four medias (TV, radio, outdoor, print) during a given 12-month period, ending as close to the award date as possible in order to receive the most current results.
The contractor will then be asked to produce digital copies of the advertisements as they appeared in each media type. 
The list of advertisements shall be available to TTB in the format of an Excel spreadsheet for each media type.  The spreadsheet shall include the media type, the advertiser/brand name of product, the ad title or headline, the air date, and the source of the ad.  TTB will purchase 50 ads from each of the four media types, for a total of 200 advertisements.  The ads requested shall be delivered via hardcopy, digital file, or videocassette, whichever most accurately portrays how the advertisement actually appeared in the media.

All requirements shall be met by the contractor within three weeks of the date of award.

In order to set this solicitation aside, BPD needs to insure that the set-aside community is capable of fulfilling the above requirements. Please provide us with the following information within  7 days of this request:
1.  The name and location of your company, contact information and identify the company as one or more of the following: 1) small business; 2) 8(a) business; 3) HUBZone small business; 4) small disadvantaged business; 5) woman-owned small business; 6) service disabled veteran owned small business, or 8) large business
2.  Provide information that clearly indicates your capability to meet the above requirements. The name and contact information for customers, current or previous, for which you have provided services similar to the ones that we require.

<SUBJECT>65--Standardization of Surgical Masks for the Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea
<SOLNBR>W81K02-08-T-3001
<RESPDATE>111907
<ARCHDATE>01182008
<CONTACT>Susan Hwang, 808-433-3686
<DESC>A.	General Information The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Surgical Masks.  The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the D oD Prime Vendor Program.   The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, and the 121st Combat Support Hospital, Korea.  This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreemen t (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a s upplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The agreement will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of award with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determi ned utilizing best value/ trade off criteria. Point of Contact:  Cheryl Janus, TRBO Clinical Analyst,  808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil B. 	Products & Performance Required The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Surgical Masks - Standard Face Masks and Face Masks with Face Shields. For this product line, the yearly estimated total usage/forecasted requirement for this region is $297,055.  This for ecast is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period.  C. 	Instructions to Quoters: DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received prior to the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Failure to meet the submittal deadline will result in exclusion.   This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network s ecurity, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. D.	Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this in itiative.   The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the v endors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vend or quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discuss ions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit efficient competition among vendors. Phase I: Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the tech nical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  	 Phase II:  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at the Pacific Region TPRB Annual Meeting in Guam, 16-17 January 2008.  Vendors are required to ship samples direct to Naval Hospital, Guam. Vendors will be given 15  business days to ship samples. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the (15th) business day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be excluded from further consideration in the standard ization process. The TPRB Annual Meeting Attendees will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert type scale, using a one to five rating. One is equal to not acceptable, three is equal to acceptable, and five is equal to highly acceptable. All clinical/perf ormance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  Phase III. After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region. Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods  (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to offer a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.  1.	Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoters responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services  offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the quoter has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal Health, the P rime Vendor for the region; 5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the quoters information provided is f actually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.) 1.

The data generated will be used to complete the planning horizon for a minimum of 5 years with further expansion to a maximum of 10 years.
Metrics:  The contractor will determine how resources will be offered and identified such as specific tree volume, green tons, or other similar metrics that can be tracked for accountability.  They will work with field units to identify log size or diameter class, one of the most important factor in ascertaining maximum value add product manufacturing that could be generated using appropriate small log processing technology with investment invited into the region if no such capacity exists.  Resources will be tabulated by specific diameter class.  As an example, less then 4inchesdbh, 4ft-7ft dbh, 7ft-9ft dbh, 9ft-12ft dbh, and greater then 12inches dbh.
Resource Offering Maps:  The contractor will create Resource Offering Maps, ROMS, for each species projected for offering during the next five years in the CROP landscape.  The ROMS provide the most up to date information on what is to be offered in the region for the next five years; who will offer it; how much per species per diameter size will be offered on an annual basis; and with in the investor landscape where the resource will come from on an annual basis.  The ROMS will be provided in its entirety to Forest Service and BLM units for further analysis and used to generate geographical information systems.
5 Years Levelized Supply:  The contractor will work with government forest land managers to obtain a 5 year projection that can belevelized in and between government agencies to create a marketable resource picture for economic investment.  Based on agency discussions, a levelized biomass map for the region will be developed that may be used to attract technology and business investment opportunities to the region.

<SUBJECT>R -- Food by Prescription for HIV/AIDS Palliative Care
<DESC>USAID/Ethiopia announces its intention to invite comments and suggestions on a draft Statement of Work (SOW) for the implementation of the USAID/ETHIOPIA Food by Prescription for HIV/AIDS Palliative Care Program. The new Food by Prescription Program (FBP) will support the delivery of therapeutic foods and counseling services to severely malnourished HIV positive individuals enrolled in prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) services, pre-antiretroviral therapy, and antiretroviral therapy (ART). 

PEPFAR Ethiopia supports the provision of nutrition and food support to specifically identified target populations when such support directly contributes to meeting the prevention, treatment and care goals stated in the U.S. Five-Year Global HIV/AIDS Strategy; and when nutrition interventions are based on scientifically-established WHO assessment criteria and guidelines for nutritional care. Furthermore, PEPFAR Ethiopia has worked closely with other bilateral donors and national government to access food resources for therapeutic and supplementary feeding from multiple sources.

<SUBJECT>70 -- InterestNet Unlimited Licenses - 12 Month Maintenance Renewal
<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to award a purchase order for commercial items to Decision Modeling, Inc.  This purchase order will be made on a sole source basis under the Authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  The purchase order will be fulfilled by the delivery for a 12 month maintenance renewal for the InterestNet Software Unlimited licenses.  Modern Information Technology Services (MITS) in response to Section 3301 of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 mandated that the IRS institute net rate interest.  In Fiscal Year 2000, an unlimited site license for Decision Modeling, Inc. (DMI) Automated Computational Tool (ACT) InterestNet Software was purchased to perform these calculations in accordance with legislation and court cases.  Without the continual maintenance on Decision Modeling, Inc. (DMI), we will be unable to support the ongoing tax changes and accurately calculate interest for the taxpayers.  The impact to the taxpayer and the IRS could be catastrophic.  This purchase order is necessary to sustain ongoing operations.   Interested parties that are able to provide the required service must clearly state their capabilities and experience in writing.   Proposals must include price, terms, conditions and point of contact name, telephone number, email address and fax number, government contact number (if applicable), performance period, business size, payment terms, tax payer identification number, and Bradstreet number.  Responses to this notice must be received by this office within 10 business days of the date of publication by NOON EST, on November 12, 2007.  All responses must be technically acceptable to the government.  NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED.  Responses should be sent to: Internal Revenue Service, Agency-Wide Shared Services - Office of Procurement; 6009 Oxon Hill Road Room 500 Oxon Hill, MD 20745 Attn: Laura E. Edmondson OS:A:P:I:C:B.

<SUBJECT>G -- Beta Test -Claims Related Data Submission
<DESC>INFORMATIONAL NOTICE TO: Software Developers -Web Service Beta Test  -- 
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, NO CONTRACT WILL BE ISSUED --

Invitation to Social Security Benefits Service Providers for Web Service Beta Test:  


Introduction

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is pleased to announce that, in 2008, the agency will develop and implement a Beta test of a web service which will allow the submission of Initial-level claims, including Disability applications and Adult Disability Reports, from companies who assist the public with filing for benefits.  

In 2008, SSA plans to develop the web service to initially collect data on the Internet Social Security Benefit Application and Disability Report.  Note that when a third party submits an application, SSA must contact the claimant before it is considered valid.  In the initial phase, organizations will be able to submit claims data in bulk and receive a confirmation of receipt of the submitted data.  In subsequent phases, the systems interface will also include the ability for organizations to check on the status of previously submitted claims information. 

SSA would like to extend an invitation to companies who assist individuals with their Social Security benefit applications, to participate in this web service claims data exchange Beta test.  The Beta test is structured to use the "consolidator" model, where the participating company serves as a conduit to receive claims data from their client base and electronically transfer the data to SSA.  

After the initial disability claims data collection effort in 2008 is evaluated, SSA will add functional capabilities in future years to collect data on electronic appeal forms and integrated claims applications.  This multi-year initiative will provide a comprehensive systems interface for companies to send claims data (including Title II Retirement and Spouse application data, disability data, and medical evidence) to SSA on behalf of their clients.  The envisioned long-range solution beyond 2008 is a web service that will facilitate the collection of data through the entire life-cycle of Internet applications, including Title II and Title XVI initial claims and appeals.  


Basic Functionality

SSA is interested in expanding the relationship with businesses by allowing the submission of claims-related data to SSA for multiple applicants using standardized data exchange protocols.  SSA would like to leverage the data that businesses may already have in their records, without requiring the labor-intensive process of keying information into a web interface one claim at a time. 


Technical Information

The Social Security Benefits Data Web Service will be a J2EE application which uses Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Web Services Description Language (WSDL) specifications.  The secure offering adheres to Version 1.0 of the Web Services-Interoperability Organization (WS-I) Basic Profile.  SOAP message integrity will be ensured by following Web Services Security Version 1.0 standards.  Because of this approach to standardization, Third Party Bulk Claims Providers can program in their environment of choice (e.g., Java, Visual Studio, .NET, and Perl) to invoke the service and feel confident that their claims data submissions will not be compromised upon delivery to SSA.  The Web Service will be integrated into SSA's existing Secure Web Services Architecture which requires the WS-Security Username Token Profile and Digital Signature standards.

The claims data web service will accept XML file format as input, and these files may be optionally compressed. Files may be attached to the message using the SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism, or they may be transmitted inline as base64 encoded data.

Throughout 2008, SSA will be finalizing this Social Security Benefits Data Web Service offering and allowing businesses to participate in planned Beta tests.  The WSDL which is required to invoke the service will be made available to the public next year with a developer?s guide to follow shortly thereafter.  The participating businesses will need to register with SSA to obtain a Secure Web Service Integrated Registration Services (IRES) PIN/password and are prepared to support the Beta test period.

Tentative key dates for the Social Security Benefits Data Web Service are:
Design and Development (November 2007 - July 2008)
Validation and Integration (July 2008 - December 2008)
Beta Implementation of Internet Social Security Benefit Application data (September 2008)
Beta Implementation of Internet Disability Report data (December 2008)

Businesses must meet the following criteria in order to participate in this Beta Test:

1.	Companies must have the current capability to write their own claims software, user guide and documentation. 
2.	Companies must have the current capability to electronically submit Initial-level disability claims to SSA for processing or provide the ability for their customers to equally do so.
3.	Companies must have the ability to modify their claims submission environment in time to participate in testing with SSA beginning July 2008.

Participating organizations must also adhere to SSA?s policies, procedures and laws relative, but not limited to; disclaimers, liability, security, integrity, privacy, entitlement factors, and benefit eligibility.  The sole intention is to provide a facilitating web service to meet client demands.  SSA retains the right to deny electronic delivery of claims data without confirmation of a valid electronic receipt.  SSA reserves the right to deny and/or terminate testing and/or any agreements.    

Companies which are interested in participating in this web service beta test and meet the above criteria should send an email to Claims.Data.Transfer@ssa.gov by November 8, 2007.  Upon receipt of your email we will invite you to a teleconference that is planned for November 15, 2007 to discuss any questions that you may have.  Please note that prior to the teleconference all companies will be expected to sign a participation agreement attesting that the aforementioned criteria is met.  Reference Web Service Beta Test in the subject field of your email and include the following information:

Contact name, mailing address, phone and facsimile numbers, and email address

This is NOT a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.   Nothing in this announcement or a contractor?s subsequent participation in this web service beta test shall be construed as obligating the Government to incur any participating company?s costs in developing the web service.

Questions concerning this announcement may be directed to the email address above or to the technical point of contact, Tammy Joyner at 410-966-2838.

<SUBJECT>R -- Pest Management
<DESC>Under FAR Part 6.302-1, the Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service intends to award on a sole source basis a Purchase Order for Technical consulting services to Dr. Robert Faust.  A sole source award is contemplated due to the unique knowledge and expertise possessed by Dr. Faust.  He is the only individual who knows the needs and requirements of the ARS National Program in Field and Horticultural Crop Entomology with emphasis on the Agency?s regional and national area-wide pest management programs.  These programs were designed, developed, and implemented only through expertise possessed solely by Dr. Faust and available through no other contractor.

Dr. Faust is the only contractor able to perform this work since he is the only person who has unique, detailed knowledge of the Agency?s Hawaii fruit fly area-wide research program.  

No other contractor has the necessary leadership or contacts to move the Agency?s area-wide Hawaii fruit fly research programs forward in a timely manner.

This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. Any company/individual that feels they have expertise that meets the needs of the Government must submit their technical data (no more than 2 pages) to support their claim.  Please submit it to Shelia Tucker, Contracting Officer via email at  Shelia.Tucker@ars.usda.gov, by 9 a.m. EST on Friday, November 9, 2007. The Government will not pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

Background

The services to be performed are associated with the duties and responsibilities of the National Program Leader for Field and Horticulture Crop Entomology with emphasis on leadership and direction for national and regional research programs for all area-wide programs particularly the Hawaii fruit fly program.  

A critical meeting is scheduled in two months for the Hawaii fruit fly program that cannot take place and move the Agency?s program forward without the specific expertise that only Dr. Faust can provide.  At this time Government personnel does not have the knowledge, expertise, and experience required to fulfill the responsibilities of this assignment with the specific scientific knowledge and established key contacts to lead the Agency?s national and regional area-wide research programs.  

This request is for services until such time as the vacant is filled, after which Dr. Faust will train the new employee in the specialized skills necessary to lead the area wide programs.

Duties:

1.Implement 3-4 new Agency Wide Pest Management (AWPM) projects in October 2007- (a) prepare extensively detailed implementation letters to the PI?s of the selected projects as a result of panel recommendations; (b) request the PI?s to address any provisos generated by the panel; (c) negotiate final budgets and have PI?s submit -0500 416/417s CRIS?s in which to receive funding; prepare letter of request to ARS headquarters? budget office and transfer FY 08 funding to the 5 currently active projects (methyl bromide alternatives, 2 projects, phase II; Hawaiian fruit flies, phase II/III; fire ants, phase III; Russian wheat aphid/green bug, phase III) and the 3-4 new projects. Note: This will total 8-9 projects in various phases of activity/implementation to lead, guide and oversee. The first year of implementation (phase I) of any new project will be critical to the success of the project in years 2-5 (phases II-III), and requires active participation by NPS. 

2.Oversee, advise and guide the process of implementation of the 3-4 new AWPM projects, which will involve the following- (a) establishment of a CORE Management Team (I may co-chair or be a member of this team, depending on the project); (b) work closely with the CORE Management Team to establish the partnership teams and their roles and responsibilities, develop a more defined conceptual plan, as needed, and other plans related to full implementation; (c) participate to help better define the scope of the project?s implementation; (d) provide advise and guidance in terms of the criteria for final selection of the demonstration sites and help better define the bounds of the implementation area, as needed; (e) ensure that baseline data collection and feasibility studies on the selected demonstration sites activities are in place as the implementation progresses; (f) working with the CORE Team better define more concisely the range of supporting research, extension, and outreach/education activities, economic, sociological, and environmental impact assessments, and technology transfer activities; (h) begin to guide the team in beginning the process for a sustainability plan that can be ready to put in place once the formal part of the program ends. Note: The educational component, which is to a greater extent the role of our university extension partners, is needed to ensure continued and broad adoption of the technologies being demonstrated beyond the local study sites and enables technical training , communication, and support targeted to the potential adopters, as well as early on user buy-in to the project. 

3.Provide and discuss recommendations for the educational and training component of the 3-4 new projects, including, for example, field days, short courses and seminars, training materials, communications such as newsletters, electronic decision support tools, and web sites, bulletin boards, trade journals, etc. These activities can be useful in the sustainability of the program in the out years as well. 

4.Guide the CORE Team of the new projects in developing an organizational and lines of communication chart once all the teams and other required pieces are decided and in place, i.e., how it all fits together in a nutshell. 

5.Participate in the 8-9 current and newly implemented AWPM projects? conference calls, CORE and other team meetings, stakeholder meetings (as needed), and other periodic meetings, as well as progress reviews, and provide guidance and recommendations; review documents generated there from, as well as other documents generated as a result of the program (e.g., monthly newsletters, ARS Information Staff news releases, etc.). 

6.Work with the CORE Teams of the new projects in formulating implementation time tables (e.g., stakeholder buy-in meetings, work team appointments, work plans for final proposed demonstration sites, work plans for educational and assessment components, selection of the supporting research projects where needed, program implementation phase activities, etc.). Keep in mind that the AWPM concept and program is quite new for the new PIs and their partners, and is a huge commitment in terms of a scope that is regional and often a multi-state effort, which requires it to be well organized and instituted from the very beginning in order to ensure a high degree of success, and even be viewed as award winning in the end, and requires keen oversight and attention by NPS. 

7.Participate and guide the wrap-up activities for the fire ant and Russia wheat/green bug projects, as well as guide them through the implementation plan for sustainability; the Hawaiian fruit fly program still has a number of intense activities to complete in FY08, especially with the Oriental fruit fly demonstration sites, the end-use commercial registration activities of the various companies working with the project and the 4 fruit fly targets, and implementation of the sustainability plan.  Other week?to-week/month-to-month activities involving issues with the projects and cooperators that inevitably arise and require NPS attention, as well as week-to-week communications and project status reports.

<SUBJECT>A -- Young Faculty Award Exhibit Session
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), regarding industry participation in an industry networking poster session and exhibit at the Young Faculty Award (YFA) workshop, to be held on or about 11/26/07 at a location in the vicinity of Arlington, VA. 
The YFA program and workshop offer a venue by which research ideas proposed by young faculty can be sponsored and promoted within the Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) at DARPA. The YFA program is expected to provide MTO with revolutionary research ideas, in the areas of interest to MTO: 1) electronics, 2) photonics, 3) micro and nano electro mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), 4) architectures, and 5) algorithms, that are critical to future technology developments.  The networking session and exhibit at the Award Workshop are intended to introduce the workshop faculty attendees to the range of industrial participants who have been involved in, or are interested in being involved in, future DARPA efforts.  The YFA Research Announcement can be found on the MTO website at: http://www.darpa.mil/mto/solicitations/baa07-18.  For reference, the list of 2006 YFA awardees can be found on the MTO website at:  http://www.darpa.mil/body/news/2007/yfa.pdf  
DARPA solicits potential industry participants to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in identifying the participants for the networking session.  DARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the company?s interest in DARPA, personnel who would attend the session, the company?s areas of interest as they relate to DARPA MTO?s areas of interest (this information is expected to be presented in poster form at the session), and its willingness to team with faculty.   
Submissions will be considered and invitations will be provided to a number of industry participants to attend the networking session at the YFA workshop.  Industry participants will have the opportunity to present a poster describing some of their MTO-related interests and activities, visit the posters presented by the faculty, and to meet these faculty and discuss potential future collaborations. If industry response warrants limitation on attendance, industry participants will be limited to a maximum of two attendees per organization.
The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Responses should be limited to three pages. Any proprietary concepts or information should be clearly identified as such. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. For all RFI responses, an additional, non-proprietary cover page is also requested identifying your company name, technical point of contact and contact information. RFI responses should be received no later than COB Nov 5, 2007. 

RFI Responses should be submitted in a commonly used electronic format and may be e-mailed or mailed on a CD-ROM to:

<SUBJECT>--US Chemical Materials Agency seeking interested technology vendors to assist Government in identifying and assessing technologies suitable for the treatment of chemical agents Lewisite (L), GA, and GA/UCON.
<DESC>The Program Manager for Chemical Stockpile Elimination (PMCSE) has the responsibility to execute the destruction of the United States chemical agent stockpile. The majority of the stockpile consists of the nerve agents GB and VX and mustard blister a gents HD and HT. The destruction of these agents is being accomplished at U.S. Army chemical agent destruction facilities (CDFs).  There are small amounts of other materials in the stockpile that also require treatment.  These materials include Lewisite (L ), GA, and GA/UCON (UCON is a thickening agent) ton containers (TCs) that are currently being stored at the Deseret Chemical Depot (DCD) in Tooele, Utah along with contaminated secondary waste generated during the storage and maintenance of the Lewisite.  The PMCSE is evaluating technology options and approaches to process the L, GA and GA/UCON TCs and L-contaminated secondary waste at DCD. PMCSE is issuing this notice to solicit interest from technology vendors in order to assist the government in identify ing and assessing technologies that may be suitable for the treatment of these materials.  Both total and partial (e.g. pre-treatment) technologies are of interest.  A pre-treatment technology, for example, is one that treats the L-contaminated secondary w aste sufficiently to allow disposal by conventional hazardous waste or non-hazardous waste means. The PMCSE is particularly interested in demonstrated technologies that can be implemented expeditiously and cost-effectively. The PMCSE is inviting interested  parties to a technology briefing to be held: 		Time: 0930-1200 hours EST 		Date: November 27, 2007 		Place: Chemical Demilitarization Training Facility, Edgewood Arsenal At this technology briefing the government will describe the challenges and requirements of the L, GA and GA/UCON TCs and L- contaminated secondary waste disposal programs. This forum will also provide attendees the opportunity to participate in a question  and answer session. At the conclusion of the briefing, interested technology providers will be given guidelines indicating how to submit their technology for consideration for inclusion in the governments disposal technology assessment efforts. The guidelines will provide a format to be used to describe the technologys basis for treatment, state of development (maturity and demonstrated scale), experience with chemical agents, and other aspects so that all the technologies can be reviewed and evaluated by the government on a  common basis. The results of the assessment will be provided as an advisory to the prospective offerors to allow them to determine whether to devote resources in pursuit of potential opportunities. Purveyors of viable technologies will be invited to parti cipate in any resultant acquisition efforts.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  

DCHA/OTI's Operations and Management Division in Washington provides OTI with an advanced level of operational and management support to help ensure ongoing and improved flexible, rapid response in political transition programming overseas. The Operations and Management Division is responsible for instituting and maintaining office-wide systems and processes, office practices and procedures, and the creation of an enhanced response capability through teamwork, responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, quality control, and customer service. The Division supports a majority program-funded workforce in the areas of administrative support, financial management of OTI program funds, human resource assistance for program-funded personnel, information and technology operations and programmatic support for Washington and the field, and procurement tracking of OTI program-funded activities.

DCHA/OTI is an exciting, fast-paced, operational office in USAID. Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/


INTRODUCTION

The incumbent serves as an Administrative Operations Assistant reporting to the Operations and Management Team Leader or his/her designee, in the Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI). Within DCHA/OTI, s/he has responsibility for daily administrative operations in support of OTI program-funded staff in Washington and the field. Approximately 95% of the workload will be in support of program-funded staff and activities in OTI/Washington and the field, and approximately 5% of the workload will also be in support of Direct Hire staff in Washington and the field.

Key functions of the Administrative Operations Assistant are to provide correspondence control and information management support for OTI, as well as provide scheduling support for OTI's 20+ intermittent (known as the "bullpen"). Additionally, the Administrative Operations Assistant will provide backup support to other OTI functions such as travel and transportation, human resources, and financial management as required. The Administrative Operations Assistant will also provide program assistant support for OTI program-funded staff when required.

For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that OTI PSC staff are deployed expeditiously and programs started quickly, often with little or no lead time.  This is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt administrative operations support.  To achieve this, OTI requires an Administrative Operations Assistant who has the capacity to work well within a team environment and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit.

The selected individual must have strong communication and coordination skills.  The incumbent must have a strong sense of responsibility and a high customer service standard. S/He will maintain lists and follow-up on all actions, be highly organized, pay close attention to detail, have excellent proofreading skills with a mastery of English grammar, and be able to handle multi-tasking well. The incumbent must be an individual with sound judgment and excellent interpersonal skills. The Administrative Operations Assistant will face situations that require an ability to manage a variety of complex portfolio(s) under extremely short deadlines.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 



Closing date and time for receipt of offers is October 30, 2007, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Anticipated award date is on or about October 31, 2007. Contact David W. Allen at David.W.Allen@uscg.mil or 252-335-6494 for questions regarding this solicitation.  Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5240, or at the following address:

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions from prospective offerors.

Question 1:  The synopsis announcement in FEDBIZOPPS makes reference to the requirement to conduct an infrared survey of all electrical panels, but this language is not in the Task Order Statement of Work posted on your web site.  Which statement of work governs in this instance?  Will the infrared be required?

Answer: There is no requirement for an infrared survey. It was incorrectly added to synopsis.

Question 2:  I want to confirm that this submission is not asking for a price quote from service providers at this time. 

Answer 2: Please review the basis of award decision, as well as the evaluation factors set forth in the combined synopsis/solicitation.? Price quote are required with your submission.

Question 3:  If that is not correct (the requirement for a quote), then I will need to get the spreadsheet listing of buildings.
