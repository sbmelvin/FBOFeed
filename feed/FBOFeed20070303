<DESC>THIS PROJECT IS ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS PURSUANT TO THE SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.     THE NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE FOR THIS PROJECT IS 238210.  The Department of Veteran's Affairs (DVA) is contemplating the award of up to six  Multiple Award Contract (MAC) to Electrical Contractors having experience with design/build and performance-based contracts, and with past experience with Department of Defense (DoD) or other Government healthcare facilities, to perform as prime contractors on various Electrical Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) projects within the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) locations.  Approximately 10 to 15% of projects may require performance in non-hostile OCONUS and/or foreign locations.  These projects are being procured by the DVA for the Air Force, or other potential DoD agencies, under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8111.  In general, the MAC contracted efforts will consist of furnishing all labor, supervision, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to perform SRM services for DoD Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) nationwide, possibly including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and other US Territories, as well as OCONUS locations such as Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Great Britain.   Anticipated requirements include one-time repair, renovation, and maintenance of electrical equipment within medical facilities to include preventive, predictive, demand, and emergency maintenance.   In addition, task orders may include efforts classified as construction requirements incidental to SRM needs (such as installation/extension of utilities, minor reconfiguration of treatment areas to support new medical equipment, etc).   Medical facilities may be of any configuration or state of repair depending on age and location.  Example systems and equipment include but are not limited to transformers, control panels, generators, metering, electrical system components, circuits, and switchboards.  Contractors must be aware of the health and life safety issues that must be considered while performing these demanding tasks in an occupied medical treatment facility with an active inpatient population.   Specific requirements, such as the stringent infection control measures in place at all medical treatment facilities, will be identified in the individual task orders, but potential offerors are advised that special requirements (to include requirements ranging from security to immunization requirements for individual workers) are typically required because the work will be performed in occupied medical treatment and/or medical research facilities.  The Government contemplates awards of at least three Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts resulting from this solicitation which will include a base year and four one-year options.  The total maximum value to be shared amongst all contracts awarded under this solicitation is estimated at $150,000,000.00 over five years. There is no guarantee that this maximum value will be distributed equally.  Awardees will share this total value through a competitive task order award process.  SPECIAL NOTE:  One MAC contractor will be issued an initial task order based on competitively evaluated award of a seed project included in the MAC solicitation.  This seed project within this MAC solicitation is a modernization effort will take place at the 374th Medical Squadron Hospital located at Yokota Air Base Japan.  The 132,300 Sq Ft facility was constructed in 1974.  This effort will entail the following tasks:  1 - Replacement of the 2000 Ampere Building Service Entrance Switchgear; 2 - Revalidation & Re-programming of the Hospital's Emergency Electrical System Life Safety Load Management system,  3 - Replacement of the Antiquated Mechanical System Motor Control Center;  4 - Revise clinic transformer service configuration to provide disconnecting means and overcurrent protection to all existing service feeders;  5 - Replacement and Upgrade of the 6600 volt Medium Voltage Feeder Circuits #9 and #10 local to the Hospital;   6 - Upgrade the 6600 volt Medium Voltage Selector Switch Serving the Clinic; 7 - Upgrade the Secondary Power System for the ASF Facility.  The estimated value of this effort is between $1,400,000 and $2,000,000.    Performance and payment bonds will be required on this task order in an undetermined percentage, and also in a majority of other task orders issued under this MAC award.  Offerors must possess the bonding capabilities and sufficient resources required by the scope of this contract in order to be favorably considered.  This requirement is being procured through the Joint Venture Acquisition Center, Austin, TX.  Solicitation documents should be available for download on or around 15 March 2007.  Contracting Officer for this anticipated contract is Ray Blomquist.  Questions specific to this solicitation may be answered by sending an email request to Marc Cypert at Marc.Cypert1@va.gov.

<CONTACT>Ray Blomquist (Contracting Officer) Marc Cypert   (Contract Specialist) Jay Hawkins   (Contract Specialist)
<DESC>THIS PROJECT IS ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS PURSUANT TO THE SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.     THE NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE FOR THIS PROJECT IS 238220.  The Department of Veteran's Affairs (DVA) is contemplating the award of up to six  Multiple Award Contract (MAC) to Electrical Contractors having experience with design/build and performance-based contracts, and with past experience with Department of Defense (DoD) or other Government healthcare facilities, to perform as prime contractors on various Electrical Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) projects within the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) locations.  Approximately 10 to 15% of projects may require performance in non-hostile OCONUS and/or foreign locations.  These projects are being procured by the DVA for the Air Force, or other potential DoD agencies, under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8111.  In general, the MAC contracted efforts will consist of furnishing all labor, supervision, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to perform SRM services for DoD Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) nationwide, possibly including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and other US Territories, as well as OCONUS locations such as Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Great Britain.   Anticipated requirements include one-time repair, renovation, and maintenance of electrical equipment within medical facilities to include preventive, predictive, demand, and emergency maintenance.   In addition, task orders may include efforts classified as construction requirements incidental to SRM needs (such as installation/extension of utilities, minor reconfiguration of treatment areas to support new medical equipment, etc).   Medical facilities may be of any configuration or state of repair depending on age and location.  Example systems and equipment include but are not limited to transformers, control panels, generators, metering, electrical system components, circuits, and switchboards.  Contractors must be aware of the health and life safety issues that must be considered while performing these demanding tasks in an occupied medical treatment facility with an active inpatient population.   Specific requirements, such as the stringent infection control measures in place at all medical treatment facilities, will be identified in the individual task orders, but potential offerors are advised that special requirements (to include requirements ranging from security to immunization requirements for individual workers) are typically required because the work will be performed in occupied medical treatment and/or medical research facilities.  The Government contemplates awards of at least three Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts resulting from this solicitation which will include a base year and four one-year options.  The total maximum value to be shared amongst all contracts awarded under this solicitation is estimated at $150,000,000.00 over five years. There is no guarantee that this maximum value will be distributed equally.  Awardees will share this total value through a competitive task order award process.  SPECIAL NOTE:  One MAC contractor will be issued an initial task order based on competitively evaluated award of a seed project included in the MAC solicitation.  This seed project within this MAC solicitation is a modernization effort will take place at the 374th Medical Squadron Hospital located at Yokota Air Base Japan.  The 132,300 Sq Ft facility was constructed in 1974.  This effort will entail the following tasks:  1 - Replacement of the 2000 Ampere Building Service Entrance Switchgear; 2 - Revalidation & Re-programming of the Hospital's Emergency Electrical System Life Safety Load Management system,  3 - Replacement of the Antiquated Mechanical System Motor Control Center;  4 - Revise clinic transformer service configuration to provide disconnecting means and overcurrent protection to all existing service feeders;  5 - Replacement and Upgrade of the 6600 volt Medium Voltage Feeder Circuits #9 and #10 local to the Hospital;   6 - Upgrade the 6600 volt Medium Voltage Selector Switch Serving the Clinic; 7 - Upgrade the Secondary Power System for the ASF Facility.  The estimated value of this effort is between $1,400,000 and $2,000,000.    Performance and payment bonds will be required on this task order in an undetermined percentage, and also in a majority of other task orders issued under this MAC award.  Offerors must possess the bonding capabilities and sufficient resources required by the scope of this contract in order to be favorably considered.  This requirement is being procured through the Joint Venture Acquisition Center, Austin, TX.  Solicitation documents should be available for download on or around 15 March 2007.
