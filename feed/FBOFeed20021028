<DESC>The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) invites proposals for basic research in support of the Air Force Defense Research Sciences Program. This program is described in the document entitled Research Interests and Broad Agency Announcement 2003-1. This document will guide proposers through AFOSR's research program and facilitate their preparation of research proposals. It is available on the AFOSR web site at http://www.afosr.af.mil/. A very limited number of hard copies will be available for individuals without access to the AFOSR web site. To request a hard copy, contact AFOSR/PKC at pkcontracting@afosr.af.mil. The general areas of interest are: (1) Aerospace and Materials Sciences; e.g., structural mechanics; mechanics of materials and devices; unsteady aerodynamics and hypersonics; turbulence and rotating flows; combustion and diagnostics; space power and propulsion; metallic materials; ceramics and nonmetallic materials; organic matrix composites. (2) Physics and Electronics; e.g., plasma physics; space electronics; atomic and molecular physics; remote sensing and Imaging; optoelectronics; laser and optical physics; quantum electronic solids; semiconductor materials; sensors in the space environment; high density optical memory. (3) Chemistry and Life Sciences; e.g., polymer chemistry; surface and interfacial science; theoretical chemistry; molecular dynamics; chronobiology; biomimetics, biomaterials, and biointerfacial sciences; perception and cognition; sensory systems; biological response profiling and assessment. (4) Mathematics and Space Sciences; e.g., dynamics and control; physical mathematics and applied analysis; computational mathematics; optimization and discrete mathematics; signals communication and surveillance; software and systems; artificial intelligence; electromagnetics; space sciences. (5) Researcher Assistance Programs; e.g., United States Air Force/National Research Council-Resident Research Associateships; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program; United States Air Force/Summer Faculty Fellows Programs. Our overriding purpose in supporting this research is to advance the state-of-the-art in areas related to the technical problems the Air Force encounters in developing and maintaining a superior Air Force; in lowering the cost and improving the performance, maintainability, and supportability of Air Force weapon systems; and in creating and preventing technological surprise. AFOSR will seek technical options that may address our need for heightened attention to homeland defense, funding those good ideas that are relevant to the AF role, and assisting in getting other good ideas to the agencies that may find them of special relevance to their role. All pertinent information, including contact persons, evaluation criteria, and details on specific areas of interest, is discussed in the AFOSR pamphlet entitled "RESEARCH INTERESTS AND BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT 2003-1". Before sending a proposal, inquire if someone at AFOSR is interested in your field of work. That person can also provide guidance for preparing a proposal before you begin to develop the proposal. Additional information and guidance on format and proposal submittal may be found in AFOSR Pamphlet 64-11, "Proposer's Guide to AFOSR's Research Programs". This pamphlet is also available on the AFOSR web site. See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>TRU Market Survey

CH2MHill Hanford Group, Inc. (CH2M Hill) is a Prime Contractor to the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of River Protection.  CH2M Hill requests that firms who have experience providing either the equipment, services, or both that meet or exceed the minimum requirements indicated below for the retrieval, treatment, dewatering, and/or packaging of transuranic (TRU) waste further described below reply to this market survey/search.  CH2M Hill is requesting information as to the type, availability, and estimated price of equipment, services, and/or equipment and services combined that are current, commercial, ?off the shelf,? and demonstrated/proven to perform any phase or aspect of retrieval, treatment, dewatering, and/or packaging for delivery of TRU waste that is being stored in single shell and double shell storage tanks.  CH2M Hill is requesting this data as part of an ongoing reassessment of its strategy to retrieve, treat (if required), package, and otherwise make ready for delivery to authorized disposal sites the below described TRU Waste.  

This request for information/market search is a follow-up to a request for information issued in June/July 2002.  CH2M Hill is further assessing its strategy for disposition of TRU materials and is in need of additional specific information.  CH2M Hill is not seeking the same data that was previously requested in June/July 2002.  For those that responded to the previous request for information, please do not duplicate the information previously provided.  


I.	Data being requested includes, and is not limited to:  

A.	Information about equipment and/or systems that can be operated by on site workers or by vendor personnel to perform the entire process, or any task or aspect of removing (i.e., retrieval), treatment (if necessary), and packaging the below described TRU Waste sludge from carbon steel tanks while mitigating airborne releases.  Wastes may be in the form of dry, hard solids, and also wet slurries, depending on the tank conditions.  Sludges may range from one (1) to fifteen (15) feet deep.  

B.	Technical data sheets, pictures, drawings, specifications, recommendations on vendor provided training and/or technical support for operation and/or maintenance, delivery times, prices, and any other information that clearly indicates the type, make, model, capabilities, retrieval rates, and configuration of equipment, tools, mobile systems, and/or stationary systems.  

C.	If your firm provides a complete retrieval, treatment, and packaging system and the service to operate it, please provide the above-described technical data of the system and a description of the corresponding service (e.g., makeup of the crew, crew size, tasks performed, etc.).  

II.	Description of TRU Waste to be retrieved, treated, dewatered, and packaged for delivery to an authorized disposal site.  [Transportation and delivery to authorized disposal site(s) of packaged TRU Waste is to be performed by others.].  CH2M Hill has categorized, for purposes of this market search, TRU Waste into that which can be ?Contact Handled? and that in which can be ?Remote Handled.?  Below are the descriptions of this TRU Waste for each category and minimum requirements.  

 
		A.	TRU Waste ? Contact Handled 

1.	Stored in Single Shell twenty (20) feet diameter tanks that have a capacity of 55,000 gallons, and are thirty-five (35) feet from the top of the soil to bottom of tank.  Each tank has four (4) each twelve (12) inch risers.  There are a maximum of eight (8) tanks from which TRU sludge are to be dispositioned.  There are also one (1) (perhaps 2) larger single shell tanks that are contact handled, are seventy-five (75) feet in diameter, 530,000 gallons each, forty (40) feet from the top of the soil to bottom of tank, and each has four (4) each twelve (12) inch risers.  

2.	TRU Waste is a sludge that may be broken up and vacuumed out or otherwise removed.  Equipment access ports or lids exist on the tanks.  

			3.	TRU Waste sludge is generally believed to be dry (i.e., no free liquids) but some may be wet and mud-like.  Free liquid may be encountered.  Surface of sludge is friable but may be harder below the surface.  Equipment must be capable of continuous and safe operations in this environment.  

4.	Minimum Equipment or System Requirements.  

a.	Processing rate to be not less than 12,000 gallons per day.  ?Processing? consists of retrieval, treatment (if required), packaging in accordance with Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) requirements (see http://www.wipp.carlsbad.nm.us/library/wac/CH-WACRev0.1.pdf and http://www.wipp.carlsbad.nm.us/library/wac/CH-WACImplementGuidance.pdf), and otherwise making ready for shipment and delivery to authorized disposal site(s).  Shipment and delivery to be performed by others.  

b.	A minimum of 730,000 gallons to be processed and packaged ready for delivery to an approved disposal site not later than September 1, 2006.  A maximum has not yet been determined.  In the data being provided to CH2M Hill, please advise what the maximum capacity of the equipment and/or system is and whether such can be enhanced.  

c.	Packaging is to meet WIPP WAC requirements.  

d.	Considering all of the above information, please include in the data to be provided an explanation of the time needed to deliver the equipment to the tank(s) site, time needed to test and make ready for production, time needed to relocate from one tank to another and begin production at the next tank, and time needed to complete the processing of 730,000 gallons of Contact Handled TRU Waste.  

e.	Provide data indicating the layout and approximate footprint and weight of the assembled system including all equipment, skids and associated ancillary equipment.  

f.	Provide data indicating the utility requirements and infrastructure needs.  
 

B.	TRU Waste ? Remote Handled  

			1.	Stored in three (3) double shell seventy-five (75) feet diameter tanks having a capacity of approximately 1 million gallons each, and are approximately fifty-five (55) feet from the top of the soil to bottom of tank.  Access and availability varies between tanks and includes four (4), six (6), twelve (12), thirty-six (36), or forty-two (42) inch risers.  

2.	TRU Waste Characteristics.  The TRU sludge contained in the double shell tanks is (i) a sludge that is mixed with and/or settled under a liquid phase, (ii) wet and contain free liquids, (iii) will not have the same characteristics as the sludge in the single shell tanks (i.e., TRU waste ? Contact Handled), (iv) pumped by CH2M Hill or Government Furnished Equipment at 80 gallons per minute intermittent, (v) 680,000 gallons total TRU sludge, and (iv) 0.5 Ci/L.  

3.	Minimum Equipment or System Requirements.  

a.	Ability to process, as a minimum, the TRU Waste described in II.B.1 and 2 above, and, retrieve, as a minimum, TRU waste that is twenty percent (20%) solids by weight, slurry with a 1.4 specific gravity.  

b.	Equipment and/or service for packaging is to include dewatering, placement of an absorbent, etc. as may be required.  Remote-handled TRU acceptance criteria are not yet available.  Respondents should consider the Contact-Handled TRU WIPP WAC requirements noted in II.A.2.a above as a planning basis.  

c.	It may be that washing or dewatering the retrieved slurry could result in changing the Remote Handled TRU Waste Slurry to a Contact Handled Waste.  

d.	It is highly desirable that the water use and content be minimal.  

e.	Total of 680,000 gallons to be processed and packaged ready for delivery to an approved disposal site not later than September 1, 2006.  

f.	Provide data indicating the layout, approximate footprint, and weight of the assembled system including all equipment skids and associated ancillary equipment.  

g.	Provide data indicating utility and infrastructure requirements to be provided by CH2M Hill at the site or work.

<DESC>The Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to negotiate and award multiple Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs) (of which the Government proposes to award one (1) contract to a Small Business Set Aside) unitizing Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders to provide technical assistance and logistics support to meet the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTIs) objectives worldwide. 

The purpose of the IQC Support Which Implements Fast Transitions (SWIFT II) is to enhance OTIs quick response capacity and field management. To implement and manage Political Transition Grants (PTGs). This procurement is solicited under full and open competition.  Any awards to large businesses will require a goal of 15% of the total estimated cost to be subcontracted to small business firms.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541611 and the small business size standards is $5.0 million.  The contract period will be for five (5) years.  The preferred method of distribution of USAID procurement information is via the Internet.  If access to the Internet is not possible, an offeror may request the solicitation on a 3.5 floppy disk (WordPerfect 5.l/2.2 format).  This Request for Proposals (RFP) and any future amendments thereto can be downloaded from http://www.fbo.gov.  The World Wideweb Address is  http://www.info.usaid.gov.  It is the responsibility of the recipient of the solicitation document to ensure that it has been received from Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) in its entirety and USAID bears no responsibility for data error resulting from transmission or conversion processes.  For those without INTERNET access, a diskette will be made available from USAID upon receipt of a written request either by U.S. mail or by facsimile. 
	
 
Background:  

This IQC is directed towards organizations that have experience working in countries in political transitions and/or in post-conflict environments that have: administered small grants (to local groups), procured goods and services (for in-kind grants, mobilizing initial team to the countries (in 72 hours) to set-up offices/hire (local) staff and have sufficient liquidity of funds (up to $1.5 million).  

Since its creation in 1994, the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) in the Bureau for Democracy Conflict Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) of USAID has developed and implemented programs  which address the post-conflict period in the transition from war to peace. OTI responds rapidly to assess, design and implement programs that have characteristics of being fast, flexible, innovative, tangible, targeted, catalytic and overtly political, focusing on the root causes of the crisis.  OTI was established precisely to overcome the temporal problems of providing aid to societies where the fighting has stopped, but the resources to move forward were often delayed.

Countries experiencing a significant transition or are emerging from civil conflict have a unique need for timely and targeted assistance that will promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances. The SWIFT-II IQC employs institutional contractors to provide technical assistance and logistics support for implementation of a small grants program during this transition period.   Contractors will be working in an environment where they will have to overcome significant challenges, destroyed or damaged infrastructures, scarcity or lack of banking & currency exchange institutions, and the lack of adequate communication services.  The types of in-kind grants that have been issued under SWIFT in the past have included, but are not limited to: 

Enhancing Citizen/Local Government Communication:  examples -  grants supporting electronic media in the form of Public Service Announcements (PSA's), politically-oriented talk shows and investigative documentaries; and publishing and distributing information through newspapers and  magazines.

Political Initiatives: examples - grants supporting public meetings, information campaigns, and elections-related efforts; enabling community reconstruction projects. 

Elections Planning/Elections: examples - get out the vote campaign; printing; elections monitoring and polling; and post-elections information campaigns.

In the field, OTI works with local indigenous groups; cooperatives; associations; informal groups; Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs); local, regional and national governments; Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs); student groups; media; international organizations; private sector and coalitions of these entities.  Activities may include efforts to: promote reconciliation, conflict resolution and prevention; advance an economic recovery with employment and vocational training; promote independent media with journalist training and law reform; demobilize and reintegrate ex-combatants;  increase land access with demining efforts; provide nation-wide training to regional and local elected officials;  promote national messages using television, radio and newsprint;  reactivate critical NGOs with start-up grants;  promote governance with elections support; develop a strong civil society; and initiate rural infrastructure rehabilitation projects with community participation.  

Services Required: 
Prime contractors shall establish and staff field offices and provide all of the administrative and technical assistance and logistics support to manage these offices and a small grants program for the Office of Transition Initiatives.  The contractor will be responsible for the start-up and implementation of the field potential program performing such tasks as office set-up and staffing, locating grantees assessing grantee worthiness and issuing in-kind grants.  As such the contractor will be required to procure the necessary equipment for office set-up, to procure in-kind good and services, issue the grants, monitor the progress of the grant project and close out the grant when the grant project is complete, including paying outstanding vendor invoices.   Critical to the SWIFT-II IQC is a contractors capability to maintain a sufficient liquidity to make expeditious rentals and purchases during start-up and ensure timely procurement and delivery of in-kind goods to grantees.  Equally important is the contractors capability to mobilize and deploy within 72 hours of award and to have operational set-up/grant making requirement completed in four weeks. 

It is anticipated that multiple five-year IQCs contracts will be awarded under the prospective RFP.  The task orders will be issued under the various pricing arrangements: Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Cost Reimbursement, Cost Plus Incentive Fee, Cost Plus Award Fee. The total value of the acquisition is estimated at $400M.  A critical component for the success of this program is the contractors capability to obtain a line of credit ($1.5M, and expenses higher as program the progresses) sufficient to finance required grants and operations for approximately 90 and prior to contractor receipt of payment of monthly vouchers.  It is required that during the performance of a Task Order the contractor maintain a bake account in the cooperating country or in the region that allows for easy and swift access to funds.

Prerequisites: A prospective prime contractor must have relevant international experience providing the kinds of services described in this synopsis in countries experiencing political transitions and/or in post conflict environments.   USAID manages programs and supports assistance in the following geographic regions, Europe and Eurasia, Africa, Asia and Near East, Latin America and the Caribbean.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to award up to six (6) firm-fixed price contract(s) ($500K each) for concept studies that provide innovative concepts for a focus mission, high speed ship.  NAVSEA expects to issue the solicitation in August 2002 with award expected shortly thereafter.  The period of performance for the studies will be three months.  Participants will be required to address construction of proposed concepts in the United States. The ship is envisioned to be a networked, agile, stealthy surface combatant.  Its warfighting capabilities should be optimized for versatility in the littorals for anti-access missions against asymmetric threats.  It will rely on mission packages employing organic manned and unmanned vehicles to execute assigned missions and operate as a node in a network centric battle force.  In order to conduct successful missions in an  adverse littoral environment, it must use innovative weapons, sensors, data fusion, C4ISR, hull form, propulsion, optimal manning concepts, smart control systems, and self-defense systems.  Primary missions for the ship are those that ensure and enhance friendly force access to littoral areas.  Primary access-focused missions will include: prosecution of small boats, mine counter measures and littoral ASW.  Secondary missions may include: intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; homeland defense / maritime intercept; SOF support; logistics support for movement of personnel and supplies.  The results of these concept studies may be used by the Navy to support requirements development, technology needs identification, and program planning for further development of a future ship design.   NAVSEA will host an unclassified Industry Day. Interested sources that would  like more information about the Concept Study are invited to attend.  Send an e-mail to Concept_Info@navsea.navy.mil for more information no later than 8 August 2002.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.*****

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award a contract to Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on a sole source basis for services performed in conjunction with the lockbox functions currently performed in the handling and processing of Medicare Part B Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) premiums.  The Social Security Act requires Medicare beneficiaries to pay their monthly (SMI) premiums through deduction from their monthly benefit check (Social Security, Railroad Retirement or Office of Personnel Management). Section 1840 (e) provides that any individual who enrolls in the Medicare program, but does not receive a monthly benefit check from which the SMI premium can be deducted or does not have his or her SMI premiums paid by a State Medicaid Agency or Formal Group, shall pay his or her premium directly to the Secretary.  These direct premium payments created a need for  lockbox services. 

 In 1984, the U.S. Treasury designated Mellon Bank, to be CMS?s lockbox contractor to handle these direct premium payments.   The contract is for the receipt and processing of beneficiary premium payments (checks, money orders, Automated Clearing House (ACH) and credit cards).  Along with the premium payments, the lockbox bank receives various types of correspondence, requiring some level of attention.  

This contract will cover the services required to handle and process the correspondence, creating a history of processed check, money orders and ACH authorization forms on CD-ROM, and customer servicing for rejected ACH and credit card payments.   This contract will be awarded for a period of one year, with four one-year option periods.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>(a)	The Office of Administration, Executive Office of the President, acting on behalf of the Office of Management and Budget, requests comments on a draft of specifications, terms, and conditions to be used in acquiring printing services for the President?s Fiscal Year 2004 Budget documents (see link at www.whitehouse.gov/omb).  The Government anticipates posting the formal RFP for this requirement as a combined solicitation/synopsis on the Federal Business Opportunities website (fedbizopps.gov) on Monday, 4 Nov, with proposals due Friday, 22 Nov.  This is a critical requirement with a statutorily mandated delivery date.

(b)	Comments may address any aspect of the draft requirements, but particular emphasis should be placed on the following:  (1)  whether the specifications identify sufficient technical detail to permit proposal preparation and performance of the work; (2) whether the specifications, terms, and conditions realistically reflect commercial practices; (3) whether the time allowed is reasonable for submitting a proposal; (4) whether any omissions, or commissions of error, are noted in the specifications, terms, and conditions; (5) whether the proposed pricing strategy (e.g., setup and run pricing) is reasonable, and whether the 2-alternative approach is necessary (i.e., is it unlikely most individual companies could deliver the required quantities within the required timeframes, making multiple awards necessary);  (6) whether improvements could be made to clarify the specifications, terms, and conditions; and (7) whether R&D/testing services, which may include producing early proofs of alternative cover concepts, are customarily included, or whether they must be priced as a separate item.

(c)	This is the first time the Office of Management and Budget has attempted to acquire printing of the President?s Budget through any source other than the Government Printing Office (GPO).  The Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel, has issued opinions supporting acquiring printing from other than the GPO (see 1996 opinion posted at www.usdoj.gov/olc/printer.fin.htm), and the Office of Management and Budget has issued a deviation from Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) to permit this competitive solicitation (see deviation posted at www.whitehouse.gov/omb).  This request for information attempts to make our first attempt as successful as possible.

(d)	The Government intends to conduct a commercial item acquisition for this requirement (reference FAR Part 12) and award one or more purchase orders for the requirements.  In addition to the specifications, terms, and conditions reflected in the document provided for review, the solicitation will contain the FAR provisions at 52.212-1, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5.  Line item structure will reflect separate items for each budget volume, which will facilitate making any necessary modifications to quantities, page counts, and prices, as described in the terms and conditions.  Another line item will cover distribution services.  The acquisition will be conducted as a full and open competition (unrestricted) and public offerors such as the GPO may submit a proposal in response to the solicitation.  The only restriction placed on offerors is that all production facilities used in the manufacture of the products must be located within an 80-km (50-mi) radius of zero milestone, Washington DC.

(e)	Comments should be submitted by COB Thursday, 31 Oct 02, to the attention of the Contracting Officer, Kathleen O?Halloran, via e-mail (preferred) at Kathleen_E._Ohalloran@OA.EOP.GOV or fax at 202-395-3982.   Comments should reference ?RFI OMB Printing.?

Esther Hayden at (614)692-4043.  This announcement is for the procurement of part-numbered items manufactured primarily by Kaiser Electroprecision (86831) and others of the same NSNs.  The NSNs are available for download via the internet at http://www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/corporate_contracts/cc.asp.
Companies interested in offering on the listed NSN, an item other 
than a Kaiser Aerospace item, please contact Esther Hayden at
614-692-4043.  No RFP will be issued as it is the intention of the Government to add these NSNs to an existing contract.  Evaluation will be on an NSN by NSN basis.  All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.  See Note(s):12 and 26.  Specifications,plans or drawings are not available.  The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.  The total duration(base plus option years)shall not exceed 3 years.  This proposed procurement includes a family group of items within the Federal Supply Class: 4720,4730,4820,
5895,5905,5930,5945 and 5990.  This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive
technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10U.S.C.2304(c)(1).  Approved sources are listed on the aforementioned web site.  While price may be a significant factor
in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this project is to replace existing roofs on 5 structures on the Helena National Forest; the administrative site building and the barn on the Helena Ranger District, two Government-owned houses on the Lincoln Ranger District, and a guard station on the Townsend Ranger District. Work consists of installing new siding, soffits, fascia, roofing, downspouts, gutters and removal of existing roofing, downspouts and gutters and related work. It is possible that work may include sheathing as there is the potential for more extensive repairs than what is known to be needed. Such additional work will be negotiated as necessary. Estimated cost range of this project is between $25,000 and $100,000. Project is located in Lewis & Clark and Meagher Counties, Montana. The NAICS Code for this project is 235610. Offer of award will be made to the Quoter whose quote, as determined by the Contracting Officer, is most advantageous to the Government, considering, but not limited to, factors such as price, contractor capacity to do the work, experience with this type of work, and past performance. Award will be made to one contractor. Completion date is June 2, 2003. Call Scott Craigle at 406-449-5201, ext. 264, for technical details. To respond to this notice send a written request either by mail to the address above or by faxing to 406-449-5081, ATTN: Procurement Assistant. Include the solicitation number, project name, company name, company contact person's name, address, telephone number, and fax number. See numbered note 26.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to release an RFP for multiple Indefinite-Quantity, Indefinite-Delivery (IDIQ) Task Order contracts for the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (Female Contraceptive Clinical Trial Topic Area).  The NIH, NICHD is the lead Federal agency for the conduct of basic, clinical and epidemiological research to develop new contraceptives and to evaluate existing methods of contraception and reproductive health.  The Center for Population Research (CPR), within NICHD, was established in 1968 by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare, with the important goal of developing new contraceptives through the use of contracts and grants. Within CPR, the Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch (CRHB) has long supported several preclinical contraceptive testing facilities, as well as facilities for chemical and peptide synthesis.  To further expand their contraceptive development capabilities, in 1996 CRHB established the initial NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN) in order to conduct Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of new female contraceptive methods.  

The NICHD CCTN is an important component of the CRHB contraceptive development capability.  Products that have undergone synthesis and successful pre-clinical testing, either through the CRHB formulation and testing facilities or through outside sources, are candidates for clinical testing in the CCTN. The CCTN is particularly valuable for providing a venue for testing new contraceptive drugs and devices that have been developed by small companies that lack the resources to support large-scale Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of new female contraceptive methods.  

The new CCTN, that will operate under Indefinite-Quantity, Indefinite-Delivery (IDIQ) Task Order contracts, will be able to rapidly develop protocols and initiate clinical trials shortly after candidate products have completed the necessary preclinical testing.  The resultant IDIQ contracts will consist of a one-year base period and six one-year option periods.  Both female and male contraceptives will undergo Phase I, II, and III clinical trials in the new CCTN.  It is estimated that the new CCTN will consist of approximately 12 sites capable of performing female contraceptive clinical trials and approximately four sites capable of performing male contraceptive clinical trials.  Please be advised that the NICHD is issuing separate RFPs for each Topic Area (Female Contraceptive Clinical Trials & Male Contraceptive Clinical Trials) in order to better facilitate and coordinate the evaluation of Proposals.  This announcement is for the RFP for the Female Contraceptive Trials Topic Area, only.

Offerors may choose to propose on either RFP (Female Contraceptive Trials & Male Contraceptive Trials) or both RFPs depending on their organization?s capabilities.  However, please be advised that the NICHD will not accept combined proposals (Female & Male) from offerors who wish to propose on both RFPs.  Those offerors that propose on both RFPs must provide separate individual Technical and Business Proposals in response to each RFP.

Organizations that believe they have the capabilities and recruitment ability necessary to participate in this network, may access the Request for Proposal(s), RFP-NICHD-2003-04, electronically on the FedBizOpps website, at http://www.eps.gov/spg/HHS/NIH/NICHD/postdate_1.html, on or about November 1, 2002. Please note that the NICHD does not intend to release hard copies of the RFP. The NICHD also reserves the right to cancel the requirement at any time prior to contract award.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION: The Division of Science Resources Statistics (SRS) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) conducts periodic Random Digit Dialing (RDD) telephone surveys of the American population to measure knowledge of and attitudes toward science and technology.  NSF is exploring the possibility of collecting similar data in the future, using Internet-based surveys administered via web-enabled panels, and plans to do methodological research comparing telephone and Internet data. NSF is seeking suitable telephone surveys which represent the population of the United States, and that can generate data comparable to (1) those we plan to draw from an Internet-based panel, and (2) those we have previously collected in telephone surveys of the American population.  We are interested in obtaining access to one or more scientific telephone surveys that (a) use random digit dialing (RDD) methodology, (b) draw a probability sample of the population of the United States, (c) ensure a minimum of 1000 completed interviews, (d) are primarily devoted to collecting data on public attitudes toward and/or knowledge about science, technology, specific topics in science and technology, and/or public or government policy issues, and (e) gather data about respondents' demographic characteristics (including, but not limited to, age, sex/gender, level of education, race/ethnicity).  NSF will supply questions about public attitudes toward and/or knowledge about science, technology, and/or specific topics in science and technology. The Contractor, with NSF approval, may adapt the questions to fit into the survey.
