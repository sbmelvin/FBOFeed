Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101  as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.      (b) Who is Covered.  INA includes provisions addressing employment  eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These  provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.      (c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may  hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and  nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The  employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be  hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility  Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three  years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.   Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site: http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm.     (d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA  are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to  confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any  employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot  program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would  verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in  place, i.e., by completing Form I-9. (1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA  in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and  Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS  databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To  receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE  Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to  (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW,  ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the  Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to  Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401  Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235. (2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States  of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia.  The  Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically  verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by  using a personal computer with a modem.  To receive information on the  Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll  free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202)  514-9981.  Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street,  NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. (3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document  Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is  identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope  of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents  an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a  machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation  system by using the machine-readable feature.  To receive information  on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE  Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for  information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I  Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.      (e) Employee Rights.  The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens  authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring  or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.      (f) Compliance Assistance.  More detailed information, including  copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative  materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's  Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of  Federal Contract Compliance Programs.      (g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or  retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA  requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice  Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their  ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office  of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9  forms.  They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of  Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized  employment.  A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a  determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee,  that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney  General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the  Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under  the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their  interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the closing date of this announcement will  be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not  to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this  notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information  received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining  whether to conduct a competitive procurement Offers are due by close of business on 19 October, 2006.

Because our U.S. personal service contractors (employees) operate worldwide and in often unusual working environments, the payroll system must allow the flexibility to adapt to the different and ever changing needs of the employees as well as meet U.S. regulations regarding salary payments and reporting.  Potential payroll service providers must meet all of the following requirements:

1.	The payroll system must be entirely web based.
2.	On a biweekly basis, the payroll service provider?s system must be capable of recording data, processing transactions, and generating reports via the Internet.  The system should also have the flexibility to allow authorized staff from overseas offices (Missions) to enter time and attendance for other Missions whose internet connection may not be available or functioning.  There are 26 pay periods per calendar year.
3.	The service provider must be intimately familiar with the US tax system (local, state, and federal).  The payroll system must be able to deduct the required taxes from the gross salary payment, maintain a running balance of the taxes deducted each pay period based on the calendar year, and generate reports reflecting the amounts deducted for each employee and the overall total deducted for the year.  The payroll system must also be able to generate Forms 941 ?Employer?s Quarterly Federal Tax Return? on a monthly and quarterly basis as well as yearly W-2 reports for each employee.
4.	W-2 reports must be printed on a standardized form acceptable to the IRS and must reflect the employee?s gross salary, federal income tax deductions, social security deductions, Medicare deductions, any and all other income or deductions made on behalf of the employee.  
5.	The payroll system must provide the flexibility for the Agency and Missions to log on to a password protected web based system and access standard and create customized reports to download and print.  The system must allow for each Mission and the Agency to have specific passwords, and access must be able to be restricted.  The system must allow specific Missions to run reports for their specific employees.  For example, the Mission in Egypt must be able to log onto the system and run a report showing a specific payment category for each of its employees for a specific time period.
6.	Due to the changing political, economic, and social environments USAID operates in, the payroll system must have to the flexibility to record all pay categories that USAID uses.  All different pay categories must be tracked and maintained by the service provider.  Frequent changes to employee salaries, benefits, and location demand that the system be user friendly and easily updated via the Internet with the latest employee information.
7.	Employees are eligible for different leave categories such as sick leave and annual leave.  Because these leave categories accrue at different rates based on years of service, the system must be able to track leave at different rates as well as maintain running balances of both used and unused leave.  Annual leave accrues at 4 hours, 6 hours, or 8 hours per pay period depending on the employee?s length of service.  Sick leave accrues at 4 hours per pay period regardless of length of service.  The system must also be able to be easily updated to incorporate any changes in accrual rates for employees.
8.	Employees may contribute a portion of their salary to an individual retirement plan.  The payroll system must be able to deduct employee contributions by either a percentage of salary basis or by a specified dollar amount, and it should not allow retirement contributions to exceed limits set by US government regulations.  Because contribution limits vary based on a variety of factors such as age and gross salary amount, the system must be flexible enough to easily accommodate changing contribution amounts.  The system must also maintain running deduction balances for employees and generate bi-weekly and yearly reports reflecting per period and cumulative total balances.
9.	The payroll provider must submit an electronic file containing all payroll activity for each particular pay period that the Agency will use for payment and posting.
10.	The payroll service provider must be able to demonstrate that their system complies with the Privacy Act requirements with respect to safeguarding all sensitive data from unauthorized access and use.
11.	The payroll service provider must provide 24 hour per day technical support for its system.
12.	The payroll service provider must have a toll free customer service number.
13.	The Agency plans to begin using the payroll system at a pilot Mission or Missions prior to implementing the payroll system agency wide.  The payroll service provider must be able to accommodate the Agency?s implementation plan.

Implementation under the contract will occur over one year followed by 4 (one) year options.

<SUBJECT>D -- To pilot innovative and sustainable approaches to serving the Last Mile of Sri Lanka with ICT-enabled community-based information centers to promote rural development
<SOLNBR>386-06-012
<RESPDATE>070506
<CONTACT>Naveen Srivastava, Acquisition & Assistance Specialist, Phone 91-11-2419-8547, Fax 91-11-2419-8390, Email nsrivastava@usaid.gov - Marcus Johnson, Regional Contracting Officer, Phone 91-112-4198796, Fax 91-112-4198454, Email marcusjohnson@usaid.gov
<DESC>USAID’s Last Mile Initiative, now present in twenty-five USAID countries, redefines the idea of the “last mile” barrier to include overcoming two constraints: 
•	Overcome geographic isolation by launching an irreversible revolution in the sustainable provision of ICT services to rural areas, partnering with both international and local private sector interests to connect rural customers to the world; and
•	Overcome economic and social isolation by transforming the development prospects of farming, small businesses and new start-ups through IT-driven increases in productivity. 

LMI is designed to support broader Mission objectives such as competitiveness, rural development, workforce development, and peace & democracy because up-to-date information and reliable and affordable communication is essential for development and USAID priorities.  LMI also supports delivering USAID programming to rural sites.
While ICTA is supporting the Nanasala roll-out, there are several ways in which USAID can add value by enabling the private sector to deliver ICT and development services through LMI centers.
USAID/Colombo seeks to target areas in strategic locations including areas where USAID is presently operating. One example may be where the Government of Sri Lanka Vocational Technical Authority (VTA) schools are being built under the USAID Tsunami Reconstruction Program.  Further, USAID sponsored LMI centers should not be built where ICTA funded Nanasalas currently exist or are planned in the short-term (next 12 months).

NASA KSC requires the DSC Q200 model to support the Polymer Science and Technology Laboratory. The DSC sensitivity is dependant on baseline flatness and reproducibility. TA Instruments is the only commercial vendor that has designed technology that generates accurate and reproducible measurements through cell design and mathematical expressions.

In addition to this the KSC Materials Science Laboratory owns and operates a suite of TA Instruments and it is required that we purchase the same for the comparison with previous data and software compatibility. TA instruments is the only manufacturer that can provide this equipment, NASA KSC intends to purchase these items from TA Instruments without full and open competition as permitted pursuant to 10 U.S.C, 2304 (c) (1) and/or other authority as appropriate, because the services and/or supplies required are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

4.	Description
DARPA/STO is soliciting technical and cost proposals from qualified corporations, research institutions, universities, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, and Department of Energy laboratories in support of Seismic and Acoustic Vibration Imaging (SAVi) Program, under Broad Agency Announcement BAA07-02.  Additional information can be found in the Proposer Information Package (PIP) supplementing this BAA.

The detailed specifications and requirements associated with this program are classified at a SECRET level, in accordance with the Security Classification Guide (DARPA SCG-404) OR in accordance with Executive Order 12958, ?Classified National Security Information?; DoD 5200.1-R, ?Information Security Program Regulation?; and DoD 520.22-M, ?National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual,? and can be found in Section 3 of the PIP.
The PIP is available upon request.  To receive a copy, interested parties must provide their CAGE code, facility level of clearance, approval date, classified mailing address, and facility security officer (FSO) by contacting the Strategic Technology Security Office at: 
	Strategic Technology Office/Security
	Attn: Mr. R. Kirkwood
	3701 Fairfax Drive
	Arlington, VA 22203

5.	Objective
The goal of SAVi is to develop and demonstrate a mobile, multi-pixel imager that can conduct remote, non-contact measurements of ground vibrations generated by active seismic or acoustic sources.  These measurements shall be processed to detect and locate near-surface tunnels and landmines (both anti-personnel and anti-vehicle landmines).  This imaging should generate positive identification in a variety of environmental conditions and in the presence of natural and man-made ?clutter?.  Moreover, false alarm rates should be held to a minimum.

In brief, the objectives of the SAVi program are to:
?	Develop an integrated, laser vibrometry, rapid surveying system to detect seismic wave anomalies caused by near-surface tunnels and acoustic resonances indicative of anti-personnel and anti-tank mines
?	Develop the components necessary to support such a system, including focal plane arrays (FPAs), lasers, active seismic & acoustic excitation sources, and detailed data processing and throughput capabilities.
?	Support stationary and mobile operations for precision characterization and high area-rate search modes for tunnels and landmines.
?	Provide near real-time detection with High PD and Low PFA for both tunnels and landmine detection in cluttered environments.

6.	Proposal Submission Information
A.	Submittal Information:
Proposals are due by 15 December 2006, 1600 hrs EST.  NOTE: Proposal receipt after the due date and time shall be governed by the provision of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).  The proposal will be submitted to the technical POC (see ? 7B) and is considered the formal submittal regarding responsiveness and compliance with the requirements of this announcement.  Proposals submitted by other means will be disregarded.

B.	Proposal Instructions:
Proposers must submit an original proposal consisting of Volumes I and II, five (5) paper copies and one electronic copy on Compact Disk (CD).  The CD must contain the technical proposal in Microsoft Word format and the Cost Proposal in Microsoft Excel format; both must reference BAA07-02.

The SAVi Program will be divided into two (2) Phases, with the first (Phase I) divided into two (2) stages: determination and demonstration of crucial components (Phase IA); and Phase IB, a demonstration of a scalable unit.  Phase II will be to design and integrate a prototype system, based on the lessons learned from Phase I.  Phases IB and II will be considered options to the original contract.

Content and Form of Proposal submission are specified in the PIP.

C.	Intergovernmental Review: None

D.	Funding Restrictions: N/A

Information announcing an updating this BAA and PIP is published on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov, the SAVi Program website at http://www.darpa.mil/sto/solicitations/BAA07-02/index.html.  Other material, such as SAVi Program updates, will be available through the SAVi Program website.

C.	Government Furnished Information (GFI):
1.	Data/Materials from Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC): The use of support, data, materials, or equipment (GFI/GFE/GFP) from an FFRDC may be available upon request.

2.	Each offeror shall include, in the Cost/Business Volume of its proposal, a contract clause, which will be incorporated in the offeror?s contract if selected, governing its interface with an FFRDC during performance of the contract.  This clause shall capture the offeror?s intended scope of interface with the FFRDC, and specifically identify any support, data, materials, or equipment it will require to be provided as GFI/GFE/GFP.  The clause shall also specify that the contractor?s responsibility for contract and system performance shall not be diminished in any respect by any GFI/GFE/GFP that may be provided by the Government or any FFRDC during performance of the contract.

D.	Organizational Conflict of Interest
Each cost proposal shall contain a section satisfying the requirements below.  Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the FAR, subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All proposers and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the proposer supports and identify the prime contract number(s) the proposer supports, and identify the prime contract number(s).  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the proposer has taken, or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict.  If the proposer believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in this section.

It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  The Government intends to use non-Government personnel as special resources to assist with the logistics of administering the proposal evaluation and providing selected technical assistance related to proposal evaluation.  These support personnel are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose and are required to sign Organizational Conflict of Interest Non-Disclosure Agreements.  By submission of its proposal, each proposer agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractors for the limited purpose stated above.  Any information not intended for limited release to support contractors must be clearly marked and segregated from other submitted proposal material.

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government?s needs may submit a proposal that will be considered by DARPA.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Government.  Small Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and/or team with others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA is set aside exclusively for Small Businesses, HBCU, or MI participation, due to the impracticability of reserving discrete or severable areas of technology for exclusive competition among these entities.

This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a cooperative agreement, procurement contract, technology investment agreement other transaction for prototype agreement, or other such appropriate award.  The Government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award determined appropriate under the circumstances.

8.	Proposal Review Information
A.	Evaluation Criteria:  Specified within the PIP.  The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time.

B.	Security: Specified within the Security Classification Guide.


9.	Award Administration Information
A.	Award Notices:  Offerors will be notified by mail, whether their proposal is recommended for award.  The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract or assistance instrument is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.

B.	Anticipated Number of Awards:  DARPA anticipates awarding multiple contracts/instruments for Phase IA of Program described in this announcement.

DARPA reserves the right to award one or no contract/instruments, if circumstances warrant.

<ARCHDATE>11302006
<CONTACT>Phyllis  Thames, (404) 305-5471
<DESC>In accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4, the FAA is notifying the public of its intent to extend its current contract with Landstar Express America, Inc., for a period of six months beginning January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007, with an option to extend contract performance an additional six-months through December 31, 2007, if necessary. The present contract with Landstar Express America, Inc., fulfills a critical need of the Federal Government to have in place an emergency transportation contract.  The purpose of this intended contract extension is to provide a bridge between the present contract, which expires December 31, 2006, and execution of a new competitively-awarded contract, which is presently in the solicitation preparation phase, as well as to provide continuity of services as required.  The Government intends to award a new contract by June 30, 2007, but requires an additional six-month option period in the event the award is not made by the intended date or a post-award transition period is required. This Market Survey is intended to solicit information that will be considered by the Government in determining whether the proposed extension of the current contract is reasonably based.  This Market Survey is not intended to bear on the solicitation for a new contract. The purpose of this Market Survey is to define the current state of the market place of vendors able to provide transportation of commodities via air, land and sea, during presidentially-declared and other emergencies, in addition to pre-positioning of transportation assets prior to the occurrence of emergency events. Information sought by this survey includes identification of firms with assets that may be sufficient to fulfill Government emergency transportation requirements, although those emergency needs cannot be specifically determined in advance.  Identified firms should provide information describing assets available for deployment both during and in advance of emergency events.  As a benchmark, firms should describe capabilities that may have been available to respond to the 2005 hurricanes. Identified firms should also provide a description of how pricing under an emergency transportation contract would be determined.  Such pricing should address pre-positioning of assets, as well as deployment during emergency events. The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries addressing this announcement.  Responses will not be returned.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.  No solicitation presently exists; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation.  When the solicitation for the new contract is issued, it will be announced and synopsized on the FAA's Contract Opportunities and/or FedBizOpps web page.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor those sites for the release of the solicitation.   The incumbent contractor does not have to submit this information.   This information is required no later than October 31, 2006. Inquiries relative to this announcement are to be submitted in writing by regular mail or by e-mail to the following: DOT/Federal Aviation Administration Attn:  Phyllis Thames, Contracting Officer, ASO-6 (ETC) P.

<DESC>Self Powered Standard Waste Box (SWB) Tug
A SWB is 36? tall, 52? wide, and 68 ?? long.  The empty weight of a SWB is 635 lbs for the box and 130 lbs for the lid.  The SWB sets flat on the ground and cannot have anything welded to the bottom to raise it up off the ground.

1)	Carries a SWB (transporting facility waste) lengthwise through a standard set of double personnel doors.  Transporting lengthwise is necessary since the facilities confined space restricts mobility for loading and changing out a SWB.  
2)	Power adjustable width to allow the tug arms to be maneuvered around the SWB, close in on the frame, and raised into the lifting handles located near the top of the SWB.  The SWB must be lifted with no cribbing or dollies required underneath the SWB.  
3)	An on board scale to prevent unintentional overloading of the containers max capacity of 4,000 pounds.  
4)	Simple straight-forward controls allowing for movements of forward, backward, raising and lowering of the arms, adjusting the width, and raising and lowering the SWB.  
5)	Load lift capability up to 6000 lbs.  
6)	Powered, wagon style steering allowing easy maneuvering and tight cornering by one person.
7)	Battery powered driver and hydraulic systems that provides 6-7 hours of use between charges.

<DESC>This acquisition was originally posted under Solicitation No. HSCG40-06-R-50002.  However, since it was not released in Fiscal Year 2006, it is being readvertised under Solicitation No. HSCG40-07-R-50006.  From this point on, the Solicitation No. will be refered to as HSCG40-07-R-50006.  The U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center intends to issue a solicitation and award a requirements type contract, with a base year and four (one year) option periods for the purchase of API 2C Certified Single Point Marine Crane systems for installation on 270? Medium Endurance Cutters.  The system will replace the existing Marine Crane with a new crane capable of launching and retrieving from the water a rigid hull inflatable boat (RHIB) 22 foot in length, 9 foot beam and 5000 pounds fully loaded.  The estimated quantity for this proposed contract for the base year and all option years is 13.  In addition to the marine crane, the Coast Guard will be requesting other deliverables such as drawings, manuals and reports.  Quantities will be identified in the solicitation.  
The crane shall be located the same as the current crane and is subject to significant weight (8000 pounds) and height (generally 8?9? at the pedestal) limitations.  All parts of the crane in the stowed position or when suspending the boat at the ready position at deck level alongside must fall below the helicopter flight path above the crane position.  The crane may exceed these height limitations while in transition from stowed position to the ready position.  The required reaches vary based upon the crane?s design but the maximum reach must be at least 17 feet and the minimum must be no greater than 15 feet, the preferred minimum reach is 7 feet.  A manual/auxiliary reach of 1000 pounds at up to 21 feet is required for boat maintenance.  The crane shall have a folding, extension, or knuckle boom (or combination thereof) configuration which limits load pendulation by keeping the boom tip as close as possible to the boat during lifting and slewing operations (level luffing).  A constant tension winch is required for maintaining tension on the boat lift point while floating alongside.  The RHIB identified above is larger than is currently installed.  
In general the contractor shall be responsible for supplying all related hardware and machinery including the crane, control station pedestal, electric control panel, HPU, interface requirements for installation, logistics information and materials, and warranty, technical and training services.  This is a systems purchase only and does not include installation of the crane system on the vessels.  
The solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps on or about November 13, 2006.  It is the contractor?s responsibility to check FedBizopps on a regular basis for the solicitation and any amendments issued.   Contractors shall be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR).  To register in CCR go to www.bpn.gov.   See number note 1.

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Those firms that are nominated to bid will be added to a distribution list of firms eligible to bid on this ICB project. These firms will then be furnished with the RFP. 

As provided for under MBC rules, however, nominations from interested firms will continue to be accepted by the Host Nation after the IFIB is issued and until the bid closing date.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Deadline to be placed on the electronic bidder distribution list: 27 October 06

2. Planned Release Date of the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB): 10 November 2006

3. Planned Bid Closing Date: 15 December 2006

Some documents are under Federal export control for ?sensitive? or ?controlled? technologies regulated by the U.S. Department of State International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) protecting national security.  Data may not be exported without an approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act.  Disclosure of the control drawings requires the verification of a current license for the oral, visual or documentary disclosure of technical data by U.S. persons to foreign persons as defined under by the U.S. Department website.  http://pmdtc.org/licenses.htm.

To participate, a foreign firm may be required to team with a U.S. firm that possesses a current and valid U.S. facility clearance with technologies/data safeguarding capabilities, inclusive of the authority to receive critical technology and/or data required to execute this program.

Prior to release of any control documents under this solicitation, any U.S. contractor must acknowledge its responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations (including the obligation, under certain circumstances, to obtain an export license prior to the release of technical data within or outside the United States) and agree that it will not disseminate any export-controlled technical data subject to this requirement in a manner that would violate applicable export control laws and regulations.   Upon review of your written request, verification of your status and acknowledgement of the contractor?s responsibility under the US Export laws and regulations, the requested attachments will be provided.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to increase the maximum ordering value of the Mechanical Systems Engineering Services (MSES) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract (NAS5-01090), for the Applied Engineering and Technical Directorate (AETD). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the services from Swales and Associates, Inc. on a sole source basis to allow continuation of the MSES IDIQ contract until the follow-on competitive procurement is completed using the Source Evaluation Board (SEB) procedures.  This increase to the MSES IDIQ contract will allow for the continuation of task orders in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. Swales and Associates, as the current incumbent, is the only responsible source qualified to perform this requirement due to its current involvement with complex systems and critical schedules of NASA flight programs such as HST, GOES, JWST, SDO, ST-5, etc.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) Only One Responsible Source. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 01, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The F-22 System Program Office (SPO), Aeronautical System  Center (ASC), is planning to exercise option Period J, Calendar year 2007  for Contract F33657-97-C-0031. The F-22 Program Support Statement of Work  (SOW) specifies engineering and other technical tasks and services to be  performed by the Contractor in the support of F-22 production and support  contracts.  These tasks and services are not uniquely linked to a specific  production lot or individual products within a lot.  Scope of Period J is  PSAS support required to support deliveries of on going lots. The F-22 aircraft blends low observability with advanced avionics, a  highly maneuverable lightweight airframe/ and ability to supercruise.  The  F-22 is designed to detect, engage, and destroy an opposing force before  detection. Further, the F-22 possesses air-to-air as well as air-to-ground  capability.  Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company (LM Aero), Marietta, GA  is currently the prime contractor for the engineering and manufacturing  development of the F-22 aircraft as well as the production of Production  Representative Test Vehicles (PRTV), PRTV II and Low Rate and Low Rate  initial Production (LRIP) Lots 1,2,3,4, and 5. This is a follow-on effort, which in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (10  U.S.C.) 2304 (c)(1), “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or  Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements,” is being awarded on a  sole-source basis to the F-22 Prime Contractor, Lockheed Martin  Corporation, Fort Worth, TX 76108. Lockheed Martin is the only known firm  with the knowledge, experience, and technical data to perform the program  support effort without substantial duplication of effort and cost to the  United States Air Force (USAF), and unacceptable delays in meeting the  USAF requirements. A Firm-Fixed-Price type contract is contemplated. The  period of performance for the support services and material ordering is  Jan 07 through Dec 07. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns  from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase  of this acquisition.

When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict  confidentiality as to the source of the concern. To address concerns only,  interested parties are invited to call the ASC Ombudsman, Steven J.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source Pikes Peak Center (Doing business as Colorado Springs World Arena) for leasing a performance location for use by the USAF Academy Band under the authority of FAR 13.106.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 48 Hours after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally by considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon the sole source justification document below.  


SUBJECT:  Sole Source Justification 

1.  Agency Identification:  This is a Justification and Approval for the sole source rental of the Pikes Peak Center for The USAF Academy Band.  This acquisition is being requested by The USAF Academy Band and supported by the 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson AFB.

2. Nature and Description of the Action Being Approved:  The USAF Academy Band performs several public concerts in Colorado Springs each year in support of the community relations mission.  In order to fulfill this mission, a concert hall must be procured.  The best venue to meet our needs is the Pikes Peak Center.

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  2006 and 2007 Performance dates are as follows:     

28 Oct 06 ? Performance		
11 Dec 06 - Concert Band load-in and rehearsal
12 Dec 06 ? Evening Performance
13 Dec 06 ? Evening Performance
11 Feb 07 - Performance
4 Mar 07 ? Performance
22 Apr 07 - Performance
14 May 07 - Concert Band load-in and rehearsal
15 May 07 - Concert Band performance - Armed Forces Week concert

Expected total cost is $.  Please see Statement of Work for further details.


4.  Statutory Authority:  Lieutenant General Rosa, Superintendent, the United States Air Force Academy mandated this venue.  Included in this request are provisions for lighting, sound, facility rental, ticket printing, stagehands, and operational staff necessary to support this event.  Requested venue is the Pikes Peak Center, Colorado Springs, CO.  Phone: (719) 477-2101.  POC:  Ms. Dorothea Lischick.  Email:  dlischick@worldarena.com

5.  Unique Qualifications:  As Commander of The USAF Academy Band, I have been directed by Lieutenant General Rosa, Superintendent of The United States Air Force Academy to hold our 2006 concerts at the Pikes Peak Center in order to alleviate security and audience transportation concerns that make using the Academy?s Arnold Hall unusable for our specific needs.  The Pikes Peak Center is the only local venue available that can offer size, acoustics and logistical support for events of this magnitude.  Therefore, we request only the Pikes Peak Center be considered for award of this contract

6.  Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Many Potential Sources:  Our knowledge of concert halls in the local area is complete.  Since there is only one that meets our needs, the selection process was simple.

7.  Statement of Determination of Fair and Reasonable:  (To be completed by the Contracting Specialist) 

8.  Description of Market Research Conducted:  It is essential that The United States Air Force Academy Band and the United States Air Force produce the highest quality community-relations performances possible.  The Pikes Peak Center possesses all the equipment, experience, acoustic properties and unsurpassed first-hand knowledge necessary to accomplish musical performances in a world-class manner, within the price point specified by our budget.  The Pikes Peak Center is uniquely qualified to hold our events because it is the only acoustically viable venue large enough to handle the 2000 plus audience attendees (per concert) within the Colorado Springs area.  Last year (2006), The USAF Academy Band delighted over 12,500 audience members in four concerts that ensured a continued strong bond between our military members and the local community.  The intent of our 2007 concert series is to increase USAF Academy and Air Force community-relations initiatives by performing seven local concerts at the preferred Colorado Springs music performance venue the Pikes Peak Center.  Performing our concerts at the Pikes Peak Center will reduce logistics and security concerns and offer a better concertgoer?s experience when compared to using the USAF Academy?s Arnold Hall Theater.  The Pikes Peak Center?s unique auditory and seating capabilities will undoubtedly leave our audiences with a lasting impression of the professionalism and readiness of the USAF Academy and our Air Force.  Our organization has done extensive research to find a concert hall that is acoustically viable and has an audience capacity of at least 2200.  The geographic front-range area includes three acceptable facilities.  In addition to the Pikes Peak Center, two other halls with acceptable acoustics and seating are located in Denver and Greeley.  Boettcher Hall (POC Mr. Drew Armstrong 303-640-2637) is the facility in Denver.  Monfort Hall Union Colony Center is in Greeley (POC June Lindenmeyer 970-350-9460).  While the other facilities also meet our minimum seating and acoustical needs, they cannot support the more than 500,000 El Paso County residents who live too far away to attend Academy Band concerts at these venues.

<DESC>PLEASE NOTE:  THIS NOTICE WAS POSTED ON 3 OCT 2006.  THIS IS A RE-POSTING FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  This pre-solicitation notice is issued to announce a small business set-aside for multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts to provide medical administrative support services to U.S. Air     Force medical treatment facilities (MTFs) beginning during Fiscal Year 2007.   The Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and the Air Force District of Washington Contracting Squadron anticipate competitively awarding up to four (4) non-personal services contracts for a base period of five (5) years with no option periods.  Small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, veteran-owned, and HUB Zone firms are encouraged to participate in this acquisition.     Foreign participation is not permitted at the prime contractor level, and all work under this contract must be performed within the United States.   Air Force contracting offices serving individual MTFs throughout the contiguous United States will place orders against these contracts by competing their specific requirements amongst the ID/IQ awardees.  The Air Force currently has 63 MTFs in 34 states within the contiguous United States.     The contractors will then be required to provide medical administrative support services within the MTFs.   Positions to be filled can include     clerical, certified and specialty administrative support services as     needed by the ordering MTF in accomplishing its mission.  The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 621999.     The small business size standard is $9 million.     The projected not-to-exceed maximum value for each ID/IQ contract is $96.4 million over the 5-year life of the contract.  The  release of the final RFP is projected for late October 2006.  Tentatively the Past Performance volume will be due in early December 2006 with the remaining proposal volumes due in mid-December 2006.   Several revisions have been made to the final RFP as a result of discussions during the Virtual Industry Day to include training requirements, per unit not-to-exceed rates, and past performance evaluation criteria.     All inquiries regarding this acquisition should be directed to Ms. Tina Altevers, Program Manager, Tina.Altevers@wpafb.af.mil, 937-255-0484, or     Ms. Clarinda Smith, Clarinda.Smith@wpafb.af.mil, 937-904-5040.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 5417   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) intends to award a sole source purchase order under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) to Dr. Yutaka Aoki. This order provides for addressing the documentation needs and responses to comments and questions from the professional community concerning both the variability analysis for the Estrogen Receptor Binding Assay and the NHANES analysis.  Because Dr. Aoki developed both analyses originally, it would be most efficient for EPA to use his experience with these projects to document the methods and  analyses, and to respond to comments or questions raised by peers. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.   No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to USEPA, Lana J. Skief (3803R), 1200 Penn. Ave  NW, Washington, DC 20460, or to facsimile number (202)565-2561, Attn: Lana J. Skief, or sent by email to skief.lana@epa.gov.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted. Responses to this notice must be submitted within fifteen (15) days after this electronic posting.  A determination not  to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.

<DESC>Post Date:  October 16, 2006 Response Date:  October 23, 2006 Title:  License Plate Reader Systems Request For Information This is a Request For Information notice released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e).  A solicitation is not available at this time. Requesting Agency The requesting agency for this notice is the Department of Interior/National Business Center/GovWorks on behalf of Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security. Background Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has a need for License Plate Reader Systems (LPR) in support of combating terrorism, balancing legitimate trade and travel with security, protecting American citizens, strengthening our control of the United States borders and modernizing and managing performance. The Office of Field Operations (OFO), Traveler Security and Facilitation, Automation for Travelers, in conjunction with the Office of Information Technology (OIT), Technology Solutions Program Office (TSPO), Enforcement Technology and Integration Branch (ETIB) initiated a program that successfully developed and evaluated a License Plate Reader System in 1993-1997.  As a result of this development and evaluation effort, CBP implemented the initial installation contract in 1998.  Currently, there are over 404 LPR systems operating on the Northern and Southern borders of the United States.  An LPR system consists of that hardware and software required to provide adequate lane(s) coverage at a given POE. These systems are installed on inbound primary inspection lanes and some outbound traffic lanes at several different U.S. Ports of Entry (POE). These systems are owned and maintained by CBP.  As installed, the current LPR system automatically locates, reads, and communicates license plate information into the Treasury Enforcement Communication System (TECS).  TECS automatically queries for law enforcement information associated with that license plate and provides the CBP Officer with the response information.  Once the LPR data is processed through TECS, it provides alphanumeric characters, along with the state/province or origin of the license plate.  As an enhancement to the current LPR system, a vehicle counting capability counts the number of vehicles passing through each lane as they enter the United States. The vehicle counting information is computerized for tabulation purposes/management reporting on the number of vehicles crossing the borders per day, per lane, in half-hour increments, and is able to maintain a one-year tabulation on a rotating monthly basis. CBP requires additional LPRs to be procured, installed, and maintained separate from those already installed. Objectives The primary objective is to procure, install, and maintain additional Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) LPR Systems, with vehicle counting and image archiving capabilities at various CBP POEs located on the Northern and Southern Borders of the United States.   Possible Scope of Services The possible scope encompasses Contractor support to procure, install, and maintain LPR systems for 46 to 600 POEs located on the Northern and Southern borders of the United States. This may involve upgrading or other maintenance operations on the currently installed equipment.  The major contractor activities may consist of the following depending upon the specific requirements: "	Program Management - Provide management oversight sufficient to ensure all task orders are completed on time and in compliance with requirements.  "	Coordination - Performance of this contract may require coordination with construction contractors.   "	Procurement - Procure COTS LPR Systems and other required material and equipment. "	Site Survey - In response to a task order request, collect site specific information to identify specific local requirements and constraints in order to facilitate LPR installation. "	Design - Design site specific LPR System for CBP approval, i.e., specific location of LPR system and recommend necessary construction work.   "	Construction - Perform construction necessary to accommodate LPR System installation and operations. "	Installation - Emplace a fully functional LPR System. "	Documentation - Provide updated configuration management documentation. "	Training - Provide on site operational and user maintenance training, to include manuals and trouble shooting aids. "	Warranty - Provide "On-Site" Warranty service. "	Technical Support Services - Provide scheduled and unscheduled maintenance to ensure system remains fully operational.  Support services includes system upgrades and reprogramming to address license plate changes and may involve upgrading or other maintenance operations on the currently installed equipment. "	If infrastructure work is required, CBP will determine whether the work will be done under this potential contract or another existing contract.   "	The scope includes support services by the Contractor to assist CBP in implementing technological refreshment enhancements for any architecture that may become a part of the CBP environment or which may become available as a result of technological improvements Capability Respondent must be capable of supplying License Plate Reader Software and Hardware and installing the system into various points of entry throughout the borders of the United States.

<DESC>Background:

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) requires logistical, technical, and administrative support to maintain, coordinate, and manage a multi-site network of clinical centers conducting research on treatment, prevention, diagno?sis, epidemiology, and natural history of HIV infection and disease in pediatric, adolescent, and maternal patient populations, including both domestic and international clinical sites. The NICHD is interested in identifying whether there any interested Small Business Concerns with the requisite capabilities to serve as the NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Studies Coordinating Center, which encompasses both clinical trials on the treatment and management of HIV infection in infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant and non-pregnant women domestically and internationally, including infrastructure development as well as clinical trials. The Coordinating Center contract currently encompasses several inter-related projects: the NICHD Network of clinical trials sites; the Latin American/Caribbean NICHD International Site Development Initiative (NISDI); a trial of post-exposure prophylaxis of HIV-exposed infants (NICHD/HPTN 040 Trial); the India Perinatal Project; and site monitoring for phase III investigator-initiated clinical trials.

Scope of activities:

Current activities conducted within the Coordinating Center contract include the following:

	NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Trials Network

The NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Trials Network (NICHD Network) has been funded through the NICHD Coordinating Center contract since 1987.  The NICHD Network consists of domestic and international clinical sites that enroll study subjects in trials related to preventing and treating HIV infection and its complications in neonates, infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women, as well as selected clinical trials of gender-specific manifestations of HIV infection in non-pregnant women.  The Network enrolls into trials conducted by the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) and Adult ACTG funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  the NICHD-funded Adolescent HIV Medicine Trials Network (ATN), and Pediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA). Domestically, the Network consists of 20 centers, located in 18 cities, in 10 states/territories (including Puerto Rico); there are six international clinical trials sites: five sites in different areas of Brazil, and one in the Bahamas.    NICHD also supports laboratory-based pathogenesis-oriented research in the context of clinical trials.  The Coordinating Center provides support to clinical trials site investigators with special laboratory expertise for the conduct of specialized pathogenesis-based studies in the context of PACTG protocols.  The Coordinating Center provides special support to international sites, such as providing specimen transport through a central Coordinating Center contract with World Courier.  

	Latin American/Caribbean NICHD International Site Development Initiative 

Through the experience of the NICHD Network with directly opening antiretroviral drug treatment trials in sites in Brazil and Bahamas in 1998 and 1999, NICHD identified a need for further training and development to increase Latin American and Caribbean capacity for the conduct of clinical trials, particularly those involving experimental drugs.  During 2000, NICHD and Coordinating Center began the NICHD International Site Development Initiative in Latin America and the Caribbean (NISDI) to address this need.  NISDI is designed to provide capacity-building and training to international sites through the conduct of two observational studies: one in HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants; and the other in HIV-exposed, but uninfected infants and HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents. The goal of this initiative is to train investigators and develop sites that will be able to participate in future international prevention and treatment trials. The Coordinating Center currently subcontracts with 25 sites in six countries participating in the protocols from Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Bahamas, Jamaica and Peru.  As of July 2006 there were 1,136 pregnant women and 1,522 pediatric patients enrolled into their respective protocols.  

	Clinical Trial of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis of HIV-Exposed Infants in Latin America and the U.S.

NICHD, through the Coordinating Center contract, is conducting a study to evaluate the efficacy of antiretroviral prophylaxis provided only to the infant in situations in which the mother has not received any antiretroviral therapy prior to delivery.  This includes women who are first identified as HIV-infected during labor, and therefore are unable to receive antepartum or intrapartum prophylaxis. This study compares three different types of post-exposure prophylaxis in such infants standard zidovudine for six weeks to the infant (standard in Brazil and U.S.); a combination of zidovudine with nevirapine; and a triple combination of zidovudine, nevirapine and nelfinavir.  The Coordinating Center is responsible for all aspects of clinical trials management, including protocol and forms design, drug repository and dispensation, regulatory issues, data management and data analysis.  Participating sites include 6 sites in the US, 8 sites in Brazil, 1 site in Argentina, and 1 site in South Africa in Johannesburg with a second site in Cape Town about to open.  

	India Perinatal Initiative 

Collaboration with investigators in southern India on a perinatal HIV prevention project was initiated in late 2000, entitled "An observational study of the seroprevalence of, and interventions to decrease the risk of maternal to child transmission of HIV in Tamil Nadu, India".  During Stage I of the study, all pregnant women registered in the antenatal clinics were offered the opportunity to participate in an educational session about HIV infection and transmission. Pre- and post-session assessments of knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs were administered to a random sample of women.  Voluntary counseling and HIV testing were offered to all women, and the seroprevalence rated was estimated.  Enrollment into this part of the protocol took place between December 2003 and December 2004.   During Stage II, those women identified as HIV-infected were offered enrollment in a prospective cohort study and offered antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother to child transmission (initially zidovudine, then zidovudine plus single-dose nevirapine).  Enrollment into this part of the protocol began in early 2004, and the final subject study visits were completed in May 2006.    It is anticipated that close-out of sites, analyses and laboratory testing of stored samples from this study will continue into the new Coordinating Center project period.

	Site Monitoring of Phase III NICHD-Funded Investigator Initiated International trials

As the NICHD international research grant portfolio has increased to include large phase III clinical trials conducted in resource-limited countries, there is an increasing need to ensure that such investigator-initiated trials are conducted ethically, in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, and with attention to human subject safety.  The Coordinating Center will conduct site monitoring for selected NICHD grantees conducting large clinical trials to ensure appropriate trial conduct.  The Coordinating Center is currently performing site monitoring for the NICHD-funded NEVEREST (Nevirapine Resistance Study) trial evaluating response to therapy in women and children exposed to single-dose nevirapine for prevention of mother to child transmission being conducted in South Africa.   

Technical requirements  

To be deemed capable to serve the Coordinating Center, a Small Business Concern must submit a written capability statement that clearly demonstrates the ability of the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities needed to implement, maintain, coordinate, and manage a multi-site network of clinical centers to conduct current and future clinical trials for evaluation of investigational therapies, diagnostic techniques, prevention strategies, epidemiology and natural history of multiple aspects of HIV infection and disease in pediatric, adolescent, and maternal patient populations.

<CONTACT>Richard Wheelwright, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3941
<DESC>In recent years it has become increasingly difficult for the Army to support many of the ground combat vehicle testers which are currently deployed.  As  time progresses certain components which are critical to the proper operation  of a vehicle tester are no longer available in the marketplace.  As a result,  the Army is required to either reverse engineer the needed parts or find  equivalent replacements from an alternative resource.  The STE M1/FVS  (simplified test equipment M1/fighting vehicle system) test equipment, which  is used to test the turret, engine and hull of the M1A1 tank, has parts which  are becoming obsolete.  The U.S. Army ARDEC is interested in acquiring  information from prospective vendors on solutions not to replace the entire  CIB (Controller Interface Box) or VTM (Vehicle Test Meter), but only the  obsolete components within each respective unit. The components within the VTM  that have obsolescence issues are the following: 32K PROM Memory CCA, Computer  CCA, Special Circuits CCA, Multiplexer/Analog-to-Digital Converter CCA,  Communication CCA, Clock/Display Driver CCA and the Ignition Interrupt Driver  (AB) Capacitor Bank. There are certain skill sets which are needed to be able to successfully  resolve these obsolescence issues, an extensive knowledge of the DFL  (Diagnostic Flowchart Language) programming language, an intimate familiarity  with the operation of the VTM and the CIB and their associated circuitry as  well as access to and an in-depth understanding of each partâ€™s Technical Data  Package.  A through understanding of the electrical wiring harnesses, wiring  diagrams and functional logic of the M1A1 is also required.  Interested  parties are invited to indicate their interest by providing a document  outlining the list of engineering tasks they believe need to be performed.   All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the government  and should be sent within 30 days of this announcement to: Department of the  Army, U.S. Army ARDEC, AMSRD-AAR-AEF-A, Bldg 91, ATTN: Scott Gearhart,  Picatinny, NJ, 07806-5000.  This is a Market Survey for information purposes  only, and not a pre-solicitation notice, nor a request for proposals.  If a  formal requirement is generated at a later date, a pre-solicitation notice  will be published.  All comments or questions in response to this market  survey are due no later than November 17, 2006.  Correspondence by e-mail is  preferred.  Send e-mails to sgearh@pica.army.mil.  Phone (973) 724-4481.

Mr. Berkowitz possesses an extensive knowledge of and experience with managing the Congressional Budget justifications for the MF and SSF, internal governance and budget review process, rate development process, the daily execution of the budget, billing for services and collecting resources. Within the enterprise system, Mr. Berkowitz was instrumental in the roll out of the general ledger module to ensure that is Standard General Ledger compliant.

<SUBJECT>--Meteorological Support Services, U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll/Reagan Test Site (USAKA/RTS)
<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with 3D Research Corporation (3DRC), Huntsville, Alabama, for a two (2) month extension to the current 3DRC Contract DASG60-03-C-0107.  The proposed action is p ursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  This extension is required to maintain uninterrupted Meteorological Support Services (MSS) in support of the US Army Kwajalein Atoll/Reagan Test Site (USAKA/RTS) mission operations pending completion of a competitive award currently underway for MSS.  Award to any source other than 3DRC would not support current agency commitments and test schedules and would result in unacceptable delays and subst antial costs.  This action will be a modification to the existing cost plus fixed fee contract.  The extension will support the execution of work planned until a new competitive award can be completed.  The significant duplication of cost involved with a n ew contractor is considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition of this short term effort.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), this action is directed toward 3D Research Corporation.  This acquisition i s not open to foreign firms.  All responses should be directed to Dianne Trimble at dianne.trimble@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  The propos ed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiated with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  This notice of intent to negotiate a sole source modification to Contract DASG60- 03-C-0107 is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit a response which will be considered.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.

Sensitive information is generally categorized as For Official Use Only (FOUO) Sensitive information, but in some cases may include other unclassified. (The protection of Classified information is beyond the scope of this clause.  If any work on Classified information is required under this contract, it is addressed under other contract clauses.) The Contractor shall protect this type of information from unauthorized release into public domain, or to unauthorized persons, organizations, or subcontractors. Information which, either alone or in aggregate, is deemed sensitive by the Bureau of Reclamation shall be protected as instructed by Reclamation in accordance with the magnitude of the loss or harm that could result from inadvertent or deliberate disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the data. All provisions of this clause also apply to all subcontractors. (c) Required protective and nondisclosure requirements: (1)  The Contractor shall not release to anyone outside the Contractor's organization any sensitive, or otherwise protected information, regardless of medium (e.g., film, tape, document, electronic), pertaining to any part of this contract or any Reclamation program or activity, unless the Contracting Officer has given prior written approval. (2) Requests for approval shall identify the specific information to be released, the medium to be used, and the purpose for the release. The Contractor shall submit its request to the Contracting Officer at least 45 days before the proposed date for release. (3) The Contractor agrees to include a similar requirement in each subcontract under this contract.  Subcontractors shall submit requests for authorization to release through the prime Contractor to the Contracting Officer. (4) Any Government-furnished information/material does not become the property of the Contractor and may be withdrawn at any time. Upon expiration of the contract, all documents released and any material using data from such documents shall be returned to the Contracting Officer's Representative for final disposition. Only with prior authorization may the Contractor retain the material. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not disclose or release the materials provided to any activity or individuals of the Contractor's organization not directly engaged in providing services under the contract that has not undergone an applicable suitability investigation commensurate with the contract specifications.  All technical data provided to the Contractor by the government shall be protected from public or private disclosure in accordance with the markings printed on them. All other information relating to the items to be delivered or the services to be performed under this contract shall not be disclosed by any means without prior approval of the authorized representative of the Contracting Officer. Prohibited dissemination or disclosure includes, but is not limited to: permitting access to such information by foreign nationals or by immigrant aliens who may be employed by the Contractor, publication of technical or scientific papers, advertising, and disclosure to contractor staff not investigated and deemed acceptable at the appropriate contract/information sensitivity level, or any other proposed public release. The Contractor shall provide adequate physical protection to such information so as to preclude access by any individual or entity not authorized such access by the government. Contractor shall maintain, and furnish upon demand of the Contracting Officer, records of the names of individuals who have access to sensitive material in its custody. All questions regarding classification, access and control shall be referred to the CO or COR for coordination with the Project Manager and/or the appropriate Reclamation Security Officer.  (d) Handling of protected information: (1) Non-Federal Users (contractors) will be granted access to sensitive information on a need-to-know basis only.  Sensitive information supplied as Government-furnished materials, to a non-Federal user, or those who produce new original work, are to be returned upon completion of the authorized work; the Contractor agrees to handle protected information as follows: (2) During non-duty hours, sensitive information must be secured within a locked office or suite, or secured in a locked container. (3) When electronically transmitting sensitive information, do so through means that limit the potential for unauthorized disclosure.  Since information transmitted over unencrypted electronic links such as telephones or electronic (e-mail) may be intercepted by unintended recipients, the Contractor, as custodian of sensitive information, will evaluate whether specific information warrants a higher level of protection accorded by a secure fax, phone, or other encrypted means of communication.   Note:  When sending sensitive information via fax, the sender shall ensure that the intended recipient is physically present at the receiving end of the fax before initiating the transmission. (4) Sensitive information may be sent via the U.S. Postal Service or commercial messenger, provided it is packaged in a way that does not disclose its contents.  Sensitive information will NOT be posted on the Internet or Contractor intranet. (5) Newly-created sensitive information will be marked "For Official Use Only (FOUO) Sensitive" in letters larger than the rest of the general text at the center-top and center-bottom of each page and within the title block on drawings and/or maps. (6) Classified information requires special marking and handling procedures.  If the Contractor will have access to classified information, Reclamation will provide additional handling instructions and training to the Contractor as needed. (7) The Contractor shall NOT provide access to employees, or subcontract employees, until written access clearance is provided by the Contracting Officer. (8) The Contractor shall incorporate the substance of this clause in all subcontracts. (e) Physical Security - General Procedural Security Requirements:  (1) The Contractor's employees governed by this contract may need to access sensitive information and/or may need access to designated restricted areas. The Contractor is responsible for providing security briefings regarding, and ensuring compliance by its employees with, any applicable security procedures of the Government installation (facility) where sensitive work may be performed under this contract. This includes the safekeeping, wearing, and visibility of a Contractor provided picture name badge or any special agency security and/or identification badges.  The Contractor shall ensure the return of all agency badges and card keys and any other Government property and information upon completion of performance or when personnel depart permanently or for an extended period of time, i.e., seven days or more.  The Contractor shall report all incidents of lost or stolen badges to the Contracting Officer no later than 48 hours after realization that the badge is missing.  The Contractor may be required to turn in access/identification badges on a daily basis. (2) The Contractor shall assure that no foreign national performs any work under this contract, either on-site or off-site and regardless of pay status, without prior clearance. Foreign nationals must be approved in writing, either before award or via the issuance of a modification to this contract.  Any such approval must specifically identify the Contractor's employee (applies to all subcontractors) by name and nationality. The Contractor shall notify the CO in writing providing the name and nationality and providing a copy of their VISA (work permit) or other information as required. Reclamation reserves the right to refuse any foreign national participation on this contract and to refuse them permission to enter Reclamation premises. (3) The Contractor shall report all contacts with entities, individuals, and counsel/representatives (including foreign entities and foreign nationals) who seek in any way to obtain unauthorized access to Reclamation sensitive information. The Contractor shall report any violations of contract provisions, laws, executive orders, regulations, and guidance to the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall report any information raising a doubt as to whether an individual's eligibility for continued employment or access to sensitive information is consistent with the interests of National Security and the Public Trust. (4) Unsanctioned, negligent, or willful inappropriate action on the part of the contractor (or its employees) [such as exploration of a sensitive system and/or information; introduction of unauthorized and/or malicious software; failure to comply with Reclamation policies, procedures, or other published security requirements; or failure to follow prescribed access control policies and or security procedures] may result in termination of the contract or removal of some contractor employees from Reclamation facilities. These actions include, but are not limited to, exploration of a sensitive system and/or information, introduction of unauthorized and/or malicious software, or failure to follow prescribed access control policies and/or security procedures. Failure to comply with Reclamation policies, procedures, or other published security requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of some contracted employees from Reclamation buildings and/or facilities.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objective, with a realistic and reasonable cost. The tradeoff process will be used to determine best value. The Government is not required to list evaluation factors in order of importance or to assign percentage values; however, when combined, technical capabilities and past performance are more important than price alone.

This is NOT a request for competitive quotes, however, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the government. If not affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice.

Identification of the nature and cost of possible operating errors, equipment problems, and              billing errors from studying the usage history and load profile of the facilities with electric             pulse meters. 6.         Monthly and year-to-date overviews of the cost, consumption, and price of all energy             accounts, and provide the monthly differences between the current-year data                 and the data from previous years and the various percentages that these differences               represent.  7.         Summaries of the quarterly and annual energy use and cost at each facility by             type of energy (i.e., electricity, natural gas, and steam, as applicable) both graphically and                      numerically.  8.         Tracking of the monthly and yearly electricity, natural gas, steam-consumption, and              cost data for each account dating back to 1985, subject to the availability of data.  9.       Quarterly and yearly comparisons of the overall BTU/GSF consumption from the             use of electricity, natural gas, and steam to an established baseline dating back to             1985. 10.       Graphs and tables comparing weather trends to energy use (electricity vs.              cooling-degree days, and steam vesus heating-degree days) for the current and two   most-recent fiscal years. 11.       Monthly update of the monthly and year-to-date consumption, cost, and price of all energy              accounts included in the system and monthly differences between the current             and prior year data and the various percentages that these differences represent. 12.         Monthly documentation of all items that require special attention by the Building Manager.                  Whenever errors or problems occur, identify them with the date of occurrence and the                    estimated costs associated with these problems.  13.     Pursue the utilities until the full recovery of all identified billing overpayments and             overcharges has been achieved.  14.      As directed by the Building Manager, obtain all missing utility bills to ensure the              completeness and accuracy of all utility data.  15.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
Project Number GHLN 06-1098

Install carpet and vinyl base in building 340
1. GENERAL:
a.  Carpet and vinyl base are not government furnished. Contractor shall supply carpet and vinyl base and deliver it to building 340 for installation. See attached drawings for locations of new carpet and vinyl base.

b.  All other materials (adhesives, edge strips, floor stone, seam joining materials, etc.) are to be furnished by the Contractor and of a type suitable for the purpose intended.

c.   There is existing carpet to be removed. Contractor is responsible for off-base disposal.

d.    There is asbestos containing floor tile in the areas of work outlined in this contract. Care needs to be taken during the removal of existing carpet to not disturb the ACM tile beneath.

e.     Hazardous Materials (HM) Approval. Contractor shall submit a Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for each chemical and/or compound proposed carpet or vinyl installation to the Base Bioenvironmental Office (90 ADOS/SGGB) for review and approval prior to delivery to the base. A HM is defined in Federal Standard DED-STD-313D, Tables I and II. The definition of materials presenting a health or physical hazard is found in OSHA 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.1200(c).

f.     Hazardous Materials Management. All HM shall be managed, stored and monitored in full compliance with all applicable local, state, federal and Air Force regulations. Contractors who bring hazardous materials onto FEW AFB without authorization are responsible for any punitive or regulatory actions. Contractors are responsible for proper disposal of containers/hazardous material. Flammable liquids shall be stored in an approved fireproof storage cabinet. All chemicals shall be secured and properly stored when not in use.

g.    Prohibited Hazardous Materials. Prohibited materials include those that contain Class 1 ozone-depleting substances (including CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and methyl bromide) per Air Force Policy and as regulated by Title VI of the Clean Air Act, specifically Sections 601-607. Other prohibited construction materials include lead (i.e. lead-based paint), asbestos, PCBs or other hazardous substances.

h.    New and Recycled Materials and Equipment Purchasing. All materials shall be new or newly manufactured using recycled materials unless otherwise indicated. All materials (both new and recycled) shall be the most suitable and highest grade and type for the intended use unless otherwise indicated. They shall be produced by a manufacturer regularly engaged in manufacturing or fabricating similar products with a history of successful production acceptable to the Contracting Office. When names of manufacturers or models are listed, the purpose is to give examples of products meeting the specifications and to provide a basis for comparison subject to the following: (1) The product is equivalent to the specified product meets or exceeds the requirements of the specifications and is otherwise suitable for the intended use. (2) The warranty meets or exceeds that of the specified product and the requirements of the specifications. (3) The Contractor coordinates the installation and makes any necessary schedule changes at no additional cost to the Government. (4) The Contractor waives claims for any time extension associated with the use of the product.

i. Recycled Product Purchases. Contractors must comply with guidelines and requirements of The Air Force Affirmative Procurement Program for the purchase and use of recycled material. This is required by Presidential Executive Order and Section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (42 U.S.C. 6962). The use of recycled products is mandatory unless they are not available within a reasonable time frame, or if the cost exceeds the cost of a non-recycled item or if they do not meet the technical requirements of the project, or if they are not available from at least two (2) sources so as to maintain a satisfactory level of competition. The construction materials included under this requirement are all types of carpet made of polyester fiber and floor tile containing recovered rubber or plastic. The use of other recycled products is encouraged.

j. Recycled Products Reporting. Contractors must compile a "Recycled Products Report" for the Resource Recovery and Recycling Manager at 90 CES/CEV listing the total quantity recycled products used.

l. Affirmative Procurement Guidance. The use of recycled material shall follow requirements based upon Department of the Air Force Space Command Affirmative Procurement Program Policy and Guidance Letter dated 8 April 2002. The main legal requirements for an Affirmative Procurement Program (APP) are derived from Executive Order 13101 dated 14 September 1998 (http;//www.ofee.gov) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Section 6002 (http://www.ornl.gov/ornlp2/sec6002.htm). This policy requires action by the Federal Government or its authorized agents to make more efficient use of natural resources by maximizing recycling and preventing waste whenever possible. Specifically, it mandates procurement of the five EPA guideline items; calls for review of government plans and specifications to eliminate virgin material requirements; requires recycling programs and requires consideration of: recovered materials use, reuse of products, life cycle cost analysis, ease of recycling, and use of environmentally preferable products.
