<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334413 with a small business size standard of 1,250 employees.<br /><br /><br />AFRL requires five (5) wideband tunable 1550nm filters. The part number for this item is WLTF-WE-P-1550-120/1.3-PM-3.0/1.0-FC/APC-USB. <br />The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with: <br />WL Photonics Inc.<br />58 Maricona Way<br />Ottawa, ON, K2T 1H2, Canada
<p>The Government has determined that no other source has commercial offerings that can meet this requirement. Optical insertion loss is one of the greatest hurdles the Government requires to overcome when working with single photons. This is especially true to optically filter these signals at a given spectral location and when we need an optical filter that can tune across multiple spectral regions. WL Photonics Inc. is capable of manufacturing filters with optical insertion losses of 1.5 dB and these devices are tunable. The WL Photonics Inc. products meet both of our required criteria, as well as the lowest known insertion loss of any tunable filter in the market. Additionally, the Government requires a system that is computer controllable due to the nature of the program experiments. These experiments can last longer than 24 hours and consist of thousands or more tunable filter settings. Such work is unpractical to be performed by hand adjusting the filters.<br /><br /><br />The specifications for the wideband tunable filters are as follows:<br />P-version fiber optic polarization-sensitive electrical tunable optical filter of 1.3nm FWHM (Flat-top) over 1490-1610 nm tuning range with 1M long<br />3.0mm OD loose cabled Panda PM1550 fiber pigtails aligned in PM slow axes (fast-axis blocking)<br />FC/APC connectors on both pigtail ends<br />500mW (CW) input optical power<br />USB interface for computer automation</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Ashley.Ellinger@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.<br /><br /><br />Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 28 June 2018.</p>

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participations has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractor but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award may be based on a combination of price, technical capability, and past performances detailed in the solicitation. Written procedure will be used for this solicitation. No telephone requests. Only written or faxed requests received directly from the requestors are acceptable. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

<DESC>The Government anticipates release of RFP on or before 06/13/2018.
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP) to support National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). This will be a follow-on requirement to a previous ten-year contract 200-2018-28045 entitled, "The CDC Influenza Reagent Resource (CDC-IRR)", which was awarded to American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), on September 26, 2008. It is anticipated that the resultant contract, renamed the "The CDC International Reagent Resource (CDC-IRR), will be cost-plus-fixed-fee and will have a period of performance of one hundred twenty (120) months. The applicable NAICS code is 541990. The RFP will be posted on FedBizOpps and is expected to be released on or about April 25, 2018. Interested parties are responsible for checking the website regularly for release of the RFP and for other procurement-related documents. TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The information provided in this pre-solicitation is for information purposes only. If there are any differences in the information provided here and the actual solicitation when released, the information provided in the actual solicitation shall govern.</p>
<p>The contractor will produce or otherwise acquire, characterize, store and distribute CDC-furnished NCIRD pathogens and other reagents, including ancillary reagents critical to the performance of CDC-developed assays, and associated with influenza, non-influenza respiratory viruses and bacteria, and other vaccine preventable bacterial diseases as described in SOW. This includes live and inactivated viruses, bacteria, nucleic acids, antisera, proteins, cell lines, hybridomas, monoclonal antibodies.</p>
<p>The purpose of IRR reagents is to assist in characterization of viral and bacterial pathogens as part of CDC surveillance and emergency response activities to aid in the development, evaluation, validation and testing of diagnostic products, to support vaccine development, and to support other research activities that increase awareness, knowledge, and understanding of the public health issues related to these pathogens. The IRR inventory of viruses, bacteria and other reagents will be regularly updated during contract performance to ensure that the catalog reflects current circulating or novel pathogen strains relevant to the ongoing surveillance and research activities of CDC and its partner laboratories. The contractor will ensure that these reagents are available to the CDC, its public health laboratory partners, and researchers and developers for characterization of circulating and novel viruses and bacteria and ensure the ability to ramp up acquisition, production, and distribution activities to surge levels as may be needed to meet the needs of a public health emergency.</p>
<p>All reagents produced by the contractor or its subcontractors shall be in accordance with the format and quality specifications as described in SOW. These reagents will be added to the IRR's existing inventory of over 200,000 vials of viruses, antigens, antisera, cell lines, monoclonal antibodies, plasmids, and other genetic materials, and over 4,000 RT-PCR typing kits and panels. All IRR reagents will be manufactured according to a recognized national or international quality standard such as ISO 9001, US current good manufacturing practices, or comparable standards. Manufacturing batch records documenting all production processes and quality control testing for every lot shall be maintained by the contractor and available for CDC review upon request.</p>
<p>Upon approval from CDC, IRR reagents that have met all required quality specifications will be made available to registered persons and institutions through an electronic "storefront" website, www.internationalreagentresource.org to be provided by the government and maintained by the contractor. The contractor will receive and process reagent order requests from the IRR website via their internal ERP system and manage all shipping logistics to recipient laboratories. In fiscal year 2016, the IRR shipped around 13,000 reagents in 1,675 shipments, 88 percent of which were to domestic states and territories.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Image Systems, a division of Double Black Imaging, for the purchase of a matched dual-head set of diagnostic monitors. These medical imaging displays support breast imaging with traditional mammography as well as Digital Breast Tomosynthesis exams. The Image Systems displays are the only medical imaging displays compatible with existing Calibration Feedback System software. This software compatibility is necessary to ensure the imaging displays are calibrated properly for DICOM&reg; 3.14 compliance. Because no other imaging displays are compatible with this software, Image Systems displays are the only displays that meet the laboratory's needs. The Image Systems displays allow the laboratory to maintain software compatibility and use one calibration feedback system to calibrate and monitor all medical displays. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS; however, all responses received within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be reviewed by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any response should be emailed to contract specialist at kwp9@cdc.gov by 13 June 2018.</p>

<SUBJECT>Payload Vibration Isolation System for the WFIRST Project
<SOLNBR>NASA-GSFC-WFIRST-D-STRUTS-HONEYWELL
<RESPDATE>061318
<CONTACT>Julie Anne Janus, Phone 3012864931, Email julie.a.janus@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for refurbishment and testing of existing D-Struts (Payload Vibration Isolation System PVIS) for the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) project.  The requirement is for the refurbishment of the WFIRST D-struts, including all personnel, services, materials, equipment and facilities necessary to refurbish, or modify the existing Honeywell D-Struts, as required, to meet WFIRST performance requirements.  The WFIRST D-struts are a payload vibration isolation system NASA has obtained from assets remaining on a previous Government program.  NASA has decided to refurbish these assets at significant cost and schedule savings, in comparison to procuring a newly developed payload vibration isolation system. This work includes the refurbishment and/or modification of existing hardware and integration with newly fabricated hardware.  This work also includes the testing and qualification of the sub-assemblies and integrated hardware.
<p>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to Honeywell Aerospace.  The estimated period of performance on this firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract is from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2020.</p>
<p>The rationale supporting the use of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) is the unique knowledge, experience, and facilities and/or capabilities that Honeywell Aerospace has with these proprietary D-struts design as described below.</p>
<p>The inherited assets provided from another Government agency were designed, fabricated, assembled and tested by Honeywell.  These were originally fabricated for the Harris Corporation based on a Honeywell proprietary design.  Honeywell has preserved all paperwork and data necessary to use these assets for a space-based mission. These struts were designed for the mirror that we are using on the WFIRST program that was donated by the original Government organization.  They were designed for the application on the past program and while the designs are not the exactly the same, they are very similar.</p>
<p>There are many examples of unique capabilities and facilities at Honeywell that support the cost and schedule savings, but a few such specific examples are as follows:</p>
<p>Honeywell has all the procedures, custom test equipment, test data, and proprietary parts and designs to meet the original D-strut designs. No other company has access to these designs and the associated test equipment. GSFC would not be able to provide any information to a competitor on the workings of these Payload Isolation Devices.</p>
<p>This effort requires an in-depth understanding of the Honeywell hardware for testing and engineering design.  These payload vibrations isolation systems have successfully flown on several missions for GSFC. Because of the proprietary design and the ability to meet the jitter requirements, these D-struts are uniquely qualified to meet the WFIRST requirements.</p>
<p>Statutory authority for this procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.  However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 13, 2018.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.</p>

<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>1. Title: Siemens AUWi Pro lease/reagent agreement.<br />2. Background Information: The National Institutes of Health Clinical Research Center (CRC) is a 240-bed hospital dedicated entirely to research into advances in medical science and public health. The Department of Laboratory Medicine serves as the clinical laboratory of the CRC. The DLM provides laboratory support for patient care and research protocols on a 24 hour basis. The clinical research applications place a high demand for analytical accuracy and precision and the volume of testing per patient is higher than routine clinical practice. The CRC requires rapid turn-around times for many specimen results.</p>
<p>3. Purpose or Objective: The DLM Chemistry Urinalysis lab has a need for a Siemens AUWi Pro system including equipment lease, reagents, and consumables for the instrumentation. In addition to shipping, installation, all supplies, reagents, quality control, and warranty repair and/or replacement for all of the Siemens instruments must be included. Two operator training sessions at the Siemens training facilities as well as in-house training sessions from a Siemens representative must be included. An additional operator must have the ability to attend the training session every year after installation.</p>
<p>4. Period of Performance: For a period of one year after award. Award is anticipated on or around June 13, 2018.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS (SCOPE OF WORK)</p>
<p><br />The leased equipment, reagents and consumables includes, but is not limited to, the following:<br />&bull; CLINTEC Novous with Rack handler <br />&bull; SYSMEX UF 1000i<br />&bull; Bar-code Scanner <br />&bull; CLINITEK ADVANTUS (back-up) <br />&bull; UF-II Sheath <br />&bull; CLINITEK NOVUS 10 Cassette <br />&bull; Atlas Neg CTL <br />&bull; Atlas Strips CTL<br />&bull; Novus CLINITEK Novus CAL <br />&bull; Rinse Additive)<br />&bull; UF-II CTL <br />&bull; UF-II Pack BAC <br />&bull; UF-II Pack SED <br />&bull; UF-II Search BAC <br />&bull; UF -II Srearch SED <br />&bull; PRO TOP SERVICE</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</p>
<p>This is a requirement for an improved urinalysis system to increase consistency and efficiency in laboratory testing including testing for critically ill patients. The AUWi Pro can detect bacteria that is too small for previous technology to detect, which means that more urinary tract infections can be identified, thereby improving patient outcomes. The proposed vendor, Siemens is the sole&nbsp;source of this unique technology, consisting of the following equipment: CLINITEK Novus, SYSMEX UF 1000i, WAM software, CLINITEK ADVANTUS (including reagents and supplies). The system is not sold by any distributors or third parties. Siemens is the only vendor for the Sysmex UF-1000i<sup>TM</sup> Urine Cell Analyzer Kit for the AUWi Pro, which is the only FDA approved instrument available for purchase that offers the fluorescent flow cytometry technology for urine. The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10-Market Research.</p>
<p><br />CLOSING STATEMENT</p>

<SOLNBR>N6134018R1208
<RESPDATE>061418
<ARCHDATE>06292018
<CONTACT>Lynn Carlson 407-380-8035
<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice  Procurement of new and upgrades to existing P-8A Training Systems devices 

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for new and upgrades to existing P-8A Training Systems devices with The Boeing Company, Saint Louis, MO, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The expected period of performance of the contract is five years with the possibility of one five year option.
  The anticipated overall value of the contract action is $1,864,070,000.  This acquisition may also include new or upgrades to P-8A training systems for both domestic and directed sole source Foreign Military Sales (FMS).

NAWCTSD intends to acquire P-8A training systems, which may include development devices, as well as modifications and upgrades of the US Navy and RAAF aircrew and maintenance training systems.  The requirements include the modification and upgrade of 20 Operational Flight Trainers (OFT), 37 Electronic Classrooms (some are modified to include Flight Management Systems Trainers (FMST)) and Mission System Desktop Trainers (MSDT), 16 Weapons  and  Tactics Trainers (WTT), 5 Part Task Trainers (PTT), 8 Deployable Mission System Trainers (DMRT), 11 Virtual Maintenance Trainers (VMT), 2 Ordinance Load Trainer (OLT), 26 Hardware Type 2 maintenance device trainers, 3 Training System Support Center (TSSC) and one Mission Avionics Systems Trainer (MAST).
  These training systems provide 70% of the P8 training and are designed to maintain concurrency with the aircraft platform.  These training systems provide 70% of the P8 training and are designed to maintain concurrency with the aircraft platform.  Initially delivered in 2011, the P-8A Training Systems in NAS Jacksonville require operational flight software updates to maintain concurrency with the aircraft. Tech refresh initiatives are necessary to maintain adequate concurrency. The P-8A training devices must have the ability to train at the full mission capability in order to achieve its role in the Fleet Training Wholeness (FTW) 2025 vision.  The entire FMS portfolio of acquisitions is not exactly known at this time, but could be any combination of new training devices or upgrades to existing training devices described within this paragraph.

P-8A unique supplies and services to be procured include the following: (a) research, development, test, and evaluation associated with developing, manufacturing, and integrating into the P-8A trainers and associated systems, subsystems, hardware and software, courseware; (b) engineering investigations and analyses; (c) forward fit and retrofit incorporation of engineering change proposals (ECPs), including designing and developing ECPs, developing technical directives, manufacturing validation and verification kits, manufacturing retrofit kits, installing kits, updating/maintaining maintenance manuals and technical publications, and spares to support ECP incorporation; (d) obsolescence management (Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages); (e) integration support for avionics, communications, mission, and weapons systems; (f) Integrated Product Support to include contractor logistics support/interim support services, technical, logistics supportability analysis, maintenance plans, provisioning, support equipment, technical manual updates and on-site training will also be included; (g) Systems fidelity upgrades and Naval Aviation Simulation Master Plan (NASMP) upgrades; (h) design, integration, test and retrofit of Increment 3 combat system capabilities into the P-8A Aircrew and Maintenance training devices; (j) Software Corrections and System Production Changes and (k) System/Subsystem Updates and Retrofits.
  The supplies and support acquired will satisfy the Governments minimum needs.

As the current sole designer, developer, integrator, manufacturer and supplier of P-8A Systems and subsystems; hardware and software components, only Boeing possesses the requisite knowledge, engineering expertise, and data rights required to design, build, modify, upgrade and deliver P-8A aircrew training systems to ensure concurrency with Fleet aircraft within the Governments requisite delivery schedule.  The training systems require concurrent incorporation of advanced and emerging technologies specific in design or application to the P-8A aircraft.  Boeing is the only contractor that can build and upgrade P-8A trainers concurrently with changes being made to the aircraft; because only Boeing has access to the requisite aircraft design data, aircraft specific software and simulated models during the design/development of the aircraft.
  Lack of concurrent training and qualifications will negatively impact Fleet readiness, mission accomplishment and the Fleets ability to use the capabilities safely.  Specifically, aircrews will not be proficient in procedures to effectively execute communications, weapons deployment and precision targeting, all of which are currently in high demand in theater.
Because the contract requires in-depth knowledge of the current trainer design and proprietary data rights, award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling P-8A mission training requirements.
 A competitive acquisition would introduce a new system to the field that may not be integrated and interoperable with the existing systems due to the restricted rights and limited data rights that resulted from the original competitive award.  This would require the Government to have two infrastructures in place for life cycle support or would require significant rework of the current design and development that would cost the Government additional non-recurring engineering (NRE) effort for the first article development testing, and retrofit of existing training systems.  As the current sole designer, developer, integrator, manufacturer and supplier of aircrew training systems and hardware and software components that are common to the P-8A, only Boeing possesses the requisite knowledge, engineering expertise, and data rights of the design required to design, build, modify, upgrade and deliver P-8A training systems and to maximize the capabilities amongst the P-8A platforms to include common component acquisitions, modifications and upgrades within the Governments requisite delivery schedule.
This Pre-solicitation notice is not a request for competitive proposals.
  It is a notice that outlines the Governments intent to award the IDIQ contract on a sole-source basis with Boeing.  However, interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, ability to obtain P-8A aircrew and maintenance elements and simulation technical data, and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Ms. Lynn Carlson at lynn.carlson@navy.mil in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2003, no later than close of business 14 June 2018.
  Small businesses can inquire with the Boeing Small Business Liaison Officer: Ms. Noemi Buque at 425-237-1655 or noemi.a.buque@boeing.com for possible subcontracting opportunities; small businesses interested in subcontracting/supplier opportunities are also encouraged to notify the Govt POC identified below as well as the NAWCTSD Small Business Deputy at leslie.faircloth@navy.mil.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses shall be limited to no more than TEN (10) pages.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
  This pre solicitation notice is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available at this time. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, a sole source award for the procurement of new and upgrades to existing P-8A aircrew and maintenance training systems and sub-systems IDIQ will be pursued.
This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).
 Matters pertaining to this notification may be directed to Lynn Carlson at 407-380-8035 or via email at lynn.carlson@navy.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this market survey is to locate potential sources to provide technical support services and repairs immediately upon contract award, for the SMART-T program.<br />Service Description<br />This acquisition is a follow-on IDIQ contract to address life cycle sustainment supportability of the SMART-T system. The current complement of SMART-Ts were acquired from 1996 to 2005, and were supported by a five-year failure-free maintenance warranties provided by Raytheon.<br />The Government issued a 3 year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract commencing in 2016. The requirement is to provide Depot level repair including major system repair, LRU repair, reset and overhaul services and on-call/on-site technical assistance, for the SMART-T hardware and its hardware components. Support will entail both CONUS and OCONUS support.<br /><br />The Future Force is expected to be spread over a much wider region than in the past. Army Corps and Divisions are expected to be dispersed among groups of widely separated, mobile enclaves. Adequate Satellite Communications (SATCOM) coverage of the entire War Theater is required to maintain communications between isolated enclaves. Given the mobility of future Army deployments, a high percentage of Army communications will be accomplished via SATCOM communications and as funding has been cut for use of other SATCOM systems, we expect increased usage/reliance on SMART-T for providing secure communications in the field.
<p>Raytheon possesses the SMART-T Technical Data Package (TDP) and design rights as well as the internal interface data that is necessary to assure system performance. Raytheon developed the SMART-T to meet the form, fit, and function of the Government's Prime Item Product Function Specification for a TACSAT Terminal and is the only entity that possesses the acceptance test data necessary to complete the required depot-level repair services required for the Program Executive Office (PEO) - Command Control Communications - Tactical (C3T) Logistics Readiness Center (LRC) to provide continuous sustainment support.</p>
<p>All interested potential sources must prepare a response (in Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, rich text or text format) no greater than 10 pages in length, specifying their ability to service the SMART-T system, as required by the US Government. Include past history in support of the SMART-T weapon system and system knowledge at a minimum. The response or related questions must be sent via email to either kate.h.mcdevitt.civ@mail.mil or nicholas.a.basirico.civ@mail.mil by 30 May 2018.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>The Army Contracting Command- Rock Island is issuing this sources sought synopsis to identify companies capable and qualified to engineer turnkey system designs for four (4) new potential Radio Frequency (RF) sites and upgrade and connect the current Army Land Mobile Radio (LMR) infrastructure (3 RF sites, 2 Dispatch Console sites) to the Joint Japan Land Mobile Radio (J2LMR) Master Core system owned by the US Air Force (USAF). The resulting contract would be a firm-fixed price contract that includes a 24 month period for manufacturing and installation followed by a 24 month warranty and maintenance period.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) TO BE SUBMITTED. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY; THE GOVERNMENT ASSUMES NO FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY COSTS INCURRED.</p>
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Army J2LMR system strategy utilizes the current USAF J2LMR system Zone Core infrastructure for the U.S. Army locations throughout Japan. The USAF established the Zone Core infrastructure at Kadena Air Base (AB) in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. The J2LMR system is a joint LMR system with system infrastructure shared between the Air Force, Marine Corp, Navy and Army. The J2LMR System is currently being upgraded from the existing Motorola ATSRO 25 System Release 7.5 to the current Motorola System Release 7.17 and is based upon Motorola's proprietary hardware and software solutions. It is supported by site controllers, which utilize Motorola software and Motorola GTR8000 repeaters.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>Each Army RF location shall be supported by a site controller and Motorola GTR8000 repeaters in the J2LMR system. The site controller controls are how the voice and data communications traffic is handled. The site controller determines which repeater communication traffic is transmitted into the air and also controls which repeater will assume a control channel function if the primary control channel repeater fails. Usage of site controllers with repeaters requires a proprietary relationship with a singular Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in order to provide the trunked repeater system.</p>
<p>The J2LMR system must also be supported by MCC 7500 dispatch consoles and system management terminals (network management client). A system management terminal provides overall administrative coverage of a LMR system to include: adding or subtracting new radios to communicate on the LMR system, designating channels or talk groups, and controlling interaction between users and dispatch consoles. The system management terminal and each of the dispatch consoles also utilize software that is proprietary to the OEM and require a proprietary relationship for compatibility between the two.</p>
<p>Each of the previously mentioned Motorola devices (site controllers, repeaters, dispatch consoles, and system management terminals) require periodic software updates and patches to meet Department of Defense Cyber Security requirements and must be covered under the warranty and maintenance agreement.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking a source that has the capability to provide all equipment and services in support of engineering, upgrading and connecting the Army system with the Air Force Core LMR infrastructure that is part of the J2LMR system. The Army anticipates procuring 4 new RF sites, 3 dispatch consoles, 33 desktop subscriber units, 87 mobile subscriber units, 200 portable subscriber units, and 3 voice logging recorders. Incidental services required are program management, installation services, maintenance, and technical refresh services.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION DETAILS</p>
<p>Interested businesses that consider themselves qualified to perform as described above are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice by 10 March 2017 no later than Noon Central Time. All responses under this Sources Sought Notice must be emailed to Conrad Baker at a.c.baker2.civ@mail.mil and Kelly Herlein at kelly.l.herlein.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>All data received in response to this Sources Sought that is marked or designated as corporate or proprietary will be fully protected from any release outside the Government.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">INTRODUCTION </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is to seek feedback from companies which can provide architecture and engineering Type A, B, and C services for the construction of a Lifeline System in Bldg. 9 Main Aircraft Hangar and in Bldg. 130 Fuel Cell Hangar for C-130 H3 models. Once design is complete the Government seeks to construct a Fall Protection System in Bldg. 9 and Bldg. 130 as noted in the draft Statement of Work (SOW). The Nevada National Guard intends to provide opportunities in its acquisitions to all types and categories of small businesses only.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Your response to the information requested will assist in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy, including whether a small business set-aside is a possibility or full and open competition. This SSN is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government (USG). The USG is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10, to identify potential small business sources to fulfill the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market. All information submitted in response to this sources sought notice is voluntary and the USG will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the USG. Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately. All submitted information shall remain with the USG and will not be returned.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The Nevada National Guard has a future requirement for &ldquo;Construct Fall Protection Bldg. 9/130.&rdquo; This SSN solicits industry's interest and capability to provide training and exercise development, and the Nevada National Guard's preference would be if one company can provide all of the work. Businesses must provide evidence showing their capability to perform the work.</span></p>

This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The NIDA Electron Microscopy (EM) Core serves NIDA-IRP researchers by providing access to existing and emerging techniques for neuronal ultrastructural analysis. The NIDA EM Core offers the following services: (1) EM services that are tailored to the needs of individual IRP researchers. Services include sectioning, immunostaining and counterstaining, and EM imaging; and (2) training and access to an ultrathin microtome and a transmission electron microscope, and data interpretation. The EM Core needs to expand its initiative to perform correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). CLEM techniques are used to combine structural and functional information from biological samples.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: <br />The EM Core needs the following to achieve this goal: (1) an inverted research stand for multimodal imaging of living and fixed specimens; (2) a modular confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a 32-channel-area-detector and Cy7 laser; and (3) a single user interface imaging software that can (a) control the inverted microscope, confocal laser scanning microscope, and scanning electron microscope involved in CLEM; and (b) perform data analysis on- and off-line. In this design, the Core will be able to collect the fluorescent image and electron microscopic image for the exact same neurons and terminals. The modular system allows the Core to study characteristics in neurons from animal models for drug abuse and addiction.</p>
<p>Project requirements: <br />NIDA-IRP Inverted Microscope (with motorized focus drive and Z PIEZO stage) and Laser Scanning Microscope with 32-channel-area-detector and Cy7 Laser to perform Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy using software to control and correlative interface adaptor that can used across inverted microscope; laser scanning microscope and scanning electron microscope</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects. The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'. Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>The Open Period for June* is June 1, 2018 to June 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement. The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements. Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov). Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in June.   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties June enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />The Open Period for June is June 1, 2018 to June 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and  each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR QUOTE; THE VA IS NOT SEEKING PRICING OR OFFERS.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, in support of Veteran Affairs Healthcare System, is currently requesting information in order to determine the existence of viable commercial sources for a Patient Elopement and Wandering System, to include installation, maintenance and training which will enhance patient safety and improve efficiency by tracking the flow of people.  

The intended contract period of performance is for a base year with four (4) one-year option periods and is based on FAR 52.232-18 Availability of Funds. 

Description of Services: The contractor shall furnish all labor, transportation, parts, test equipment, tools, and expertise necessary to provide, install and implement a patient elopement and wandering (PEW) solution at VA facilities as designated by VA.  The PEW solution will be deployed in iterative phases as designated by VA leading up to the full performance requirements as defined.  VISN 20 sites at which the PEW solution will be deployed will be designated by VA.  The Contractor shall provide hardware and software components and deliver training services.  In addition, the Contractor shall conduct site assessments, perform wireless coverage site surveys (if required), update facility drawings, develop application documentation, and provide end-of-contract transition support.  The PEW solution must be compatible with the VISN 20 asset tracking infrastructure and system, so that at a later date, solely at VA s option, the PEW and asset tracking system maybe integrated such that patient location can be provided in the PEW, even when tagged patients leave the PEW area(s) and are in other parts of the VA facility. 
Facilities at which the solution may be deployed are listed in Table 1.  The solution may be deployed as a no cost option at the discretion of VA to other sites and their affiliate stations at a later date.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Interior, US Geological Survey (USGS) is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement for the potential need for the following:

Investigate various capture methods for invasive Asian Carp using novel gear types in backwaters of the Illinois River.  Research will focus on evaluating novel gear types with three objectives.  The first objective is to compare the passive capture efficacy of two different trap net types in the Illinois River watershed.  The second objective is to compare the capture efficacy of the two different trap nets with manipulating behavior such as driving/herding fish with a sound stimulus, electroshock or with the use of chemical attractants.  The third objective is to compare and contrast other important aspects such as cost effectiveness and maintenance, size distribution of catch, and non-target catch rates for each capture technique. Contractor shall provide personnel assistance, training and net and boat resources in order to meet the objectives stated above.  
Contractor shall provide scouting for potential sites along the Illinois River will begin spring 2018. A minimum of two sites need to be selected with at least three trap net locations within each site. However, more than two sites is beneficial in the event of unexpected water level fluctuations. Quality sites are backwater areas off of the Illinois River that have little to no flow, high numbers of bigheaded carp, maintain water throughout the year, and have areas with enough depth to place a net. The minimum depth requirement for the nets is approximately 5.5 feet. Water quality, weather, and other environmental variables will be taken each day at each site throughout the study. Once sites are established, the trap nets will be set in the site at specified locations for five days. All nets will be left to fish for four consecutive nights with no more than 24 hours between checking each net. Coordinates and net orientation will be taken for each net. Fish captured will be identified, weighed, measured and recorded for each gear type. After the fourth night of fishing, each net will be pulled from the water and stored for the following week. The next trial will take place at the second site following the same protocols as the first. Trials the third week will return to site one but the locations of the nets within that site will be changed. This rotation will occur for six weeks yielding six replicates.
The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541715.

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.  

If your organization has the potential ability to meet this requirement, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address, telephone number, and size and type of ownership for the organization; and 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements. 

The government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; 2) secure and apply the full range of corporate financial, human capital, and technical resources required to successfully perform similar requirements; 3) implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with tight program schedules; cost containment; meeting and tracking performance; hiring and retention of key personnel and risk mitigation; and 4) provide services under a performance based service acquisition contract.

Overview and Objectives

VA, under its Enhanced-Use Leasing (EUL) authority (38 U.S.C.  8161- 8169; in conjunction with the West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016, P.L. 114-226), is seeking expressions of interest from qualified SDVOSBs and VOSBs and other interested parties to serve as a  Principal Developer  for purposes of implementing a critical aspect of the Draft Master Plan for the redevelopment of the VA Greater Los Angeles (GLA) Healthcare System, West Los Angeles Campus, in Los Angeles, California.  The Draft Master Plan outlines VA s intent to transform the West L.A. Campus into a vibrant community providing housing for homeless and at-risk Veterans and their families, in addition to healthcare, benefits, employment, and other services for all eligible Veterans.  More information about VA s Draft Master Plan efforts can be found on the following website: https://www.losangeles.va.gov/masterplan/.

For purposes of this project, the Principal Developer would be a non-VA entity who has the qualifications outlined in Section V of this Sources Sought Notice.  The Principal Developer will be expected to develop at least 900 units of permanent supportive housing for homeless and at-risk Veterans and their families on the North Campus utilizing VA s EUL authority.  Specifically, VA s EUL authority provides a mechanism for VA to lease certain VA-owned assets to private entities for up to 75 years to finance, develop, renovate, construct, operate, and maintain permanent supportive housing units, related infrastructure, and on-site community-based support services for homeless and at-risk Veterans and their families.  The first asset to be developed by the Principal Developer would be Building 207.  VA conducted a Public Hearing on Building 207 and the Principal Developer concept on April 26, 2018.  The slides and questions and answers from the Hearing can be found on the following website: https://www.losangeles.va.gov/masterplan/. 

VA s Office of Asset Enterprise Management (OAEM) administers the EUL Program.  EULs require approval by the VA Secretary and oversight through annual compliance inspections.  VA refers Veterans for housing and monitors housing operations.  As part of the EUL process, VA must comply with all applicable laws, including all environmental and historic preservation requirements.  The West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016 explicitly prohibits the sale of land, and all improvements will revert to VA at the end of each lease.

The objectives of this development opportunity include but are not limited to:

Accelerate delivery of permanent supportive housing for homeless and at-risk Veterans and their families on the West Los Angeles Campus;  

Repurpose vacant and underutilized land and buildings on the North Campus for purposes of permanent supportive housing; and,

Develop a housing model geared towards enabling Veterans to achieve self-sufficiency and live independently.

Additional information on the VA s EUL Program may be obtained at:
http://www.va.gov/assetmanagement/. 

Development Scope

The intent of this Sources Sought Notice is to assist VA with market research and to determine if this contracting opportunity must be set-aside for competition restricted to SDVOSB or VOSB concerns, pursuant to 38 U.S.C.  8127.  In this regard, responses to this Sources Sought Notice, in addition to other market research, will assist VA in determining whether there is a reasonable expectation that two or more SDVOSB or VOSB concerns will submit offers and that the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States, pursuant to 38 U.S.C.  8127.  Accordingly, VA seeks SDVOSB or VOSB concerns that can develop, plan, and implement the agreed upon plan to transform VA s North Campus assets into over 900 units of additional permanent supportive housing for homeless and at-risk Veterans and their families in accordance with VA s EUL authority.  

All North Campus assets with the exception of all previously executed EULs and the State Home, Columbarium, and Columbarium expansion area, as shown in Attachment A to this Sources Sought Notice, would be evaluated by the Principal Developer for potential redevelopment, subject to VA approval.  Following selection, the Principal Developer would undertake all necessary investigation activities to produce development scenarios for the North Campus to provide permanent supportive housing to meet the needs of homeless and at-risk Veterans and their families.  Upon completion of the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) / Programmatic Environmental Impact Report (PEIR), the Principal Developer would proceed in implementing selected development scenarios. 

The first asset to be developed by the Principal Developer would be:  

Building 207 
51,010 Gross Square Feet
Built in 1940
Most Recent Use: Supportive Housing
Poor Condition 
Contributing Historic Resource

Medical Center Background

The GLA Medical Center is part of the larger VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System that serves over 90,000 unique Veterans in Kern, Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties.  The GLA campus is located at the major intersection of Sepulveda Boulevard, Interstate 405 (also known as the San Diego Freeway) and Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, California.  The campus is located in the densely urbanized Brentwood neighborhood, and encompasses approximately 388 acres.  The GLA campus is one of largest medical center campuses in the VA system.  It provides a full range of medical services to eligible Veterans, including state-of-the-art hospital and outpatient care, rehabilitation, residential care, and long-term care services.  It also serves as a center for medical research and education.  The GLA Medical Center serves as a major training site for medical residence in partnership with the David Geffen School of Medicine the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and University of Southern California (USC) School of Medicine, as well as more than forty-five (45) colleges, universities and vocational schools in seventeen (17) different medical, nursing, and other healthcare and administrative programs.

The Draft Master Plan for the GLA Campus is a framework that will assist VA in determining and implementing the most effective use of the campus for Veterans, particularly for homeless and at-risk Veterans, including underserved populations such as female Veterans, aging Veterans, and those who are severely physically or mentally disabled.  The primary considerations include: (a) the provision of appropriate levels of supportive housing on the campus in renovated existing buildings or newly constructed facilities, while taking into account the parties' assessment of available housing units available in the greater Los Angeles community; (b) respect for individual Veteran choices on whether to seek housing at the GLA campus or in the local community; (c) parameters of applicable law, including but not limited to the appropriate integration of persons with disabilities into the community, and applicable environmental and historic preservation laws, regulations, and consultation requirements; and, (d) need for appropriate levels of bridge and emergency/housing along with short-term treatment services on campus, to provide state-of-the-art primary care, mental health, and addiction services to Veterans, particularly those that are chronically homeless.

Eliminating damage to agriculture, property, Natural Resources (threatened and endangered species), etc. from the offending species (Feral Swine) is a priority with our program. To combat damage related issues, our program currently employs 5 full-time Wildlife Specialist who conduct damage management activities for Feral Swine. Damage Management activities include trapping, night operations, aerial surveillance, etc. A key ingredient for night time surveillance/operations include the use of durable UTVs for accessing remote areas, carcass retrieval, disposal, etc. The equipment in question could be utilized on a daily basis; throughout the year.

STATEMENT OF WORK 


Background:  

The requirement is to provide the following:

A. Service agreements for the maintenance and repair of a Leica CM3050 S Cryostat.

The instrument is a very sophisticated device that permits researchers to cut thin slices of frozen tissue samples inside a refrigerated cabinet that can be maintained at -20 C. These slices are then mounted on glass slides and examined under a microscope. The instrument uses proprietary technologies to move the cutting blade and cool the cabinet. The continued operation of the instrument within manufacturer s specifications for refrigeration and accuracy of blade motion is required for successful completion of ongoing VA research funded by Merit Review and other mechanisms. In addition, the refrigeration system requires regular service to ensure its function. We therefore are requesting a service agreement that provides for periodic maintenance on at least an annual basis and which provides onsite repair should a malfunction occur.
 
At the present time only field service technicians from Life Technologies are certified to inspect and service these instruments.

A continuing core mission of this department is to make assessments and analysis on global and country-specific emerging trends and events affecting worldwide oil markets and prices and their implications for the U.S. economy, businesses, and national security. In support of the mission, DOE regularly seeks out subscription companies, which offer access to specialized online tools, systems and databases meeting DOE-ET's requirements.<br />The DOE is seeking to contract with EIG to obtain specialized energy-focused online proprietary tools, systems and database that enable DOE's Energy Security Division's (ESD) analysts to complete their mission for conducting assessments, analysis and reporting.

<DESC><strong>Synopsis: </strong>
<p>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p>Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a new analytical capability for assessment of intracranial dynamics. It offers the possibility for the monitoring of transcranial expansion and related physiological phenomena in humans resulting from variations in intracranial pressure (ICP) caused by injuries to the head and/or brain pathologies. The technology uses constant frequency pulse phase-locked loop (CFPPLL) technology to measure skull expansion caused by pressure and its variations in time. This approach yields a more accurate, more robust measurement capability with improved bandwidth that allows new analytical approaches for assessing the physiology of skull expansion under pulsatile cerebral blood flow. The dynamical quantities assessable with the CFPPLL include skull volume expansion and total fluid. Such an instrument can serve to measure intracranial dynamics with equation based algorithms, and offers a path to measure or determine quasistatic intracranial pressure, along with the pulsatile related intracranial pressure increments. Supportive measurements, such as time dependence of arterial pressure waveforms together with time dependent phase change of transcranial expansions can serve as the basis of noninvasive techniques to measure intracranial pressure. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent pending.</p>

<p><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p>Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a methodology to measure damage onset and grow at multiple locations in a composite structure during fatigue loading. The thermography inspection is non-contact and can cover very large areas. The acoustic emission sensors require contact at only the sensor attachment points and can cover large areas. The acoustic emission measurement is very sensitive to damage formation events such as matrix cracking, fiber breaks, and delamination, however the event location is approximate. An infrared camera is able to detect damage growth and location at areas of heating (due to fiber breaks, rubbing of disbond areas and matrix cracks) and thus confirm the acoustic emission measurements. If the loading is cyclic the infrared camera is also able to detect the relative depth of the damage. Combining both technologies helps to reduce false indications, confirm damage growth areas and where ultimate failure will occur. This provides a measurement capability to detect growing damage (location and size) for improved structures testing or during in-service applications. Multiple infrared (IR) cameras and multiple acoustic emission sensors can be employed internally or externally for full coverage of the structure. When significant damage growth is detected, the structure can be taken out of service for repair or for further inspections. This technology has been demonstrated for structures testing. In-situ NDE inspections are necessary to provide structural engineers a tool to incrementally control and document damage growth as a function of fatigue cycles before failure. This allows for the comparison of NDE results to develop and validate progressive damage analysis (PDA) models. The ultimate goal is to use the validated PDA models to decrease the time required to certify composite structures and therefore save development costs. Real time NDE can document the progression of damage and provide the documentation of ultimate failure mechanisms.</p>

<DESC><strong>Synopsis: </strong>
<p>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p>Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed an enhanced sputtering process that addresses some of the weaknesses of conventional metal deposition sputtering.  The conventional sputtering process has emerged as one of the major deposition techniques for thin film coating practices in research and industrial production. The process is limited by low deposition rates and low kinetic energy of the sputtered atoms. This not only slows the time required to sputter a film, it lowers the purity of the sputtered film. The Molten Target Sputtering (MTS) method can increase the kinetic energy, the energy latency, and the flux density of sputtered atoms by combining the benefits of both magnetron sputtering and evaporation systems. It does this by a clever, but simple mechanical modification to the magnetron sputtering gun. For the MTS method, a simple 1~2mm (depth and width) ring-shaped groove is cut between the magnets in order to keep a gap between the copper plate and the sputtering target. This effectively is an efficiency increase to a current magnetron based sputtering machine. The ring enhances the magnetic field intensity and increases the temperature of the target material.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />A key difference in design between a conventional sputtering gun and the MTS gun seems very minor, but the ring-shaped groove between magnets allows for trapping a portion of magnetic field within the groove. A trapped field creates an additive force to expel the ionized particles (atoms and molecules combined within plasma) by increasing their kinetic energy. The ring groove also serves to increase the target material temperature because the conduction passage of thermal energy to the water-cooled copper sink is interrupted by the empty space of a ring groove below the target. Accordingly, the target surface material is heated to a higher temperature, which in turn increases the flux density by more easily liberating the atoms from the target. The MTS enables the growth of high quality thin (&lt;100nm) and thick (&gt;100m) films with the molten target and plasma. The degree of precise formation of rhombohedral film structures on a sapphire substrate is greatly improved. This leads to higher quality crystals with higher yield. In conventional techniques a pre-processor is required to elevate the sapphire wafer temperature through a 2-4 hour thermal soak process. These high temperatures, typically 890 deg. C, are costly and burdensome in a production facility. The MTS process can enable the sputtering temperatures to operate at 500 deg. C and still produce superior quality films.  NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent pending.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT
Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the Naval War College, College of Distance Education (CDE), Naval War College has a requirement to prepare, conduct and administer two graduate level seminar courses in Theater Security Decision Making (TSDM) in accordance with the provided syllabus as part of the Naval War Colleges Fleet Seminar Program in the Annapolis MD and Washington DC areas.  Period of Performance: 24 July 2018 to 7 June 2019. Under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1) pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the product or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.
 A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the government.
As evidenced in the sole source justification provided by the requiring activity there is only one contractor that has the specific qualifications that meet the peculiar requirements of this contract. The courses are essentially the same as taught in residence at Newport, with the CDE resident faculty preparing the course syllabus, procuring teaching materials, and funding administrative expenses. Because the site of the courses is removed from the Naval War College (NWC) it is necessary to contract individuals who reside in those areas to serve as an instructor and local administrator for the courses.
 The qualifications for this position are unique in that they require a combination of professional education, joint and naval warfare operational experience, familiarity with the Naval War College (NWC) missions and functions, and experience and competence in teaching the NWC curriculum at the graduate level using the NWC methodology.  
The Contractor identified is Edmund Barrett. Period of Performance: 24 July 2018 to 7 June 2019. The NAICS code is 611710 and small business size of $15M.
 Ph.D. in Military History, International Relations, National Security Affairs, Strategic Studies, or related field -Desirable
 MA/MS in Military History, International Relations, National Security Affairs, Strategic Studies, or related field - Required
 Joint Professional Military Education Phase I - Highly Desirable
 Joint, Naval, or Interagency experience at grade of 0-5, or equivalent -Highly Desirable

A Request for Quote is expected to be released on May 29, 2018 with a response date of June 8, 2018 at 10:00 am (EST).
 The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition FAC 2005-96, Effective: November 6, 2017. The NAICS code is 611710 and small business size standard is $15,000,000.00. Although this is a sole source requirement all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency to robert.allcock@usnwc.edu no later than December 6, 2017 at 10:00 am (EST). No phone calls please. If no responses are received by the above referenced date/time a sole source contract will be awarded no later than June 8, 2018.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to solicit and negotiate a Sole Source, Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order with Kistler Instruments, Corp.  This procurement is for a custom X ray transparent force plate to be used as part of the Biplane Fluoroscopy Laboratory at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System. In the Biplane Fluoroscopy Laboratory, research subjects walk over a walkway while a pair of fluoroscopes (X rays), located beneath the walkway, image their foot. We require this walkway to be equipped with a force plate, so that the reaction force of the subject (which is a key component of several biomechanical analyses) can be measured as they walk over the platform. Accordingly, the force plate must be transparent to X rays; otherwise the force plate itself will create artifacts that obscure the foot images.  There are currently no off the shelf X ray transparent force plates in the market that can provide required functionality. Therefore, the research team reached out to force plate manufacturers to design a custom solution. Only Kistler Instruments Corp. proposed a custom solution involving the use of four load cells. 

Therefore, IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), it has been determined that only one source is reasonably available.  The anticipated date of award is 5/31/2018.  Any firm that believes it can meet this requirement, please contact the Contracting Officer before COB 5/30/2018.

This requirement is for:    
Department of Veterans Affairs
Seattle VA Medical Center
1660 S Columbian Way
Seattle, WA 98108

This notice satisfies the requirement at FAR 5.201(b)(1), to publicize the proposed contract action.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation will be made available.  Any responses received will only be considered for the purposes of determining the market place for future procurements.  The Government will not pay for information submitted.  This will be the only notice of the Government's intent to solicit, negotiate, and award to one source to satisfy this requirement.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

                    (i)  Cloud computing services shall be subject to the security requirements specified in the clause 252.239-7010, Cloud Computing Services, of this contract.
 
                    (ii)  Any other such IT service or system (i.e., other than cloud computing) shall be subject to the security requirements specified elsewhere in this contract.<BR><BR>(2)  For covered contractor information systems that are not part of an IT service or system operated on behalf of the Government and therefore are not subject to the security requirement specified at paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the following security requirements apply:
 
                    (i)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, the covered contractor information system shall be subject to the security requirements in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations (available via the internet at http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171) in effect at the time the solicitation is issued or as authorized by the Contracting Officer.
 
                    (ii)(A)  The Contractor shall implement NIST SP 800-171, as soon as practical, but not later than December 31, 2017. For all contracts awarded prior to October 1, 2017, the Contractor shall notify the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO), via email at osd.dibcsia@mail.mil, within 30 days of contract award, of any security requirements specified by NIST SP 800-171 not implemented at the time of contract award.
 
                            (B)  The Contractor shall submit requests to vary from NIST SP 800-171 in writing to the Contracting Officer, for consideration by the DoD CIO. The Contractor need not implement any security requirement adjudicated by an authorized representative of the DoD CIO to be nonapplicable or to have an alternative, but equally effective, security measure that may be implemented in its place.
 
                            (C)  If the DoD CIO has previously adjudicated the contractors requests indicating that a requirement is not applicable or that an alternative security measure is equally effective, a copy of that approval shall be provided to the Contracting Officer when requesting its recognition under this contract.
 
                            (D)  If the Contractor intends to use an external cloud service provider to store, process, or transmit any covered defense information in performance of this contract, the Contractor shall require and ensure that the cloud service provider meets security requirements equivalent to those established by the Government for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Moderate baseline (https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/) and that the cloud service provider complies with requirements in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this clause for cyber incident reporting, malicious software, media preservation and protection, access to additional information and equipment necessary for forensic analysis, and cyber incident damage assessment.<BR><BR>(3)  Apply other information systems security measures when the Contractor reasonably determines that information systems security measures, in addition to those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this clause, may be required to provide adequate security in a dynamic environment or to accommodate special circumstances (e.g., medical devices) and any individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies based on an assessed risk or vulnerability. These measures may be addressed in a system security plan.
 
      (c)  Cyber incident reporting requirement.
 
            (1)  When the Contractor discovers a cyber incident that affects a covered contractor information system or the covered defense information residing therein, or that affects the contractors ability to perform the requirements of the contract that are designated as operationally critical support and identified in the contract, the Contractor shall
 
                    (i)  Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense information, including, but not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data, and user accounts. This review shall also include analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as well as other information systems on the Contractors network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised covered defense information, or that affect the Contractors ability to provide operationally critical support; and
 
                    (ii)  Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil.
 
            (2)  Cyber incident report. The cyber incident report shall be treated as information created by or for DoD and shall include, at a minimum, the required elements at http://dibnet.dod.mil.
 
            (3)  Medium assurance certificate requirement. In order to report cyber incidents in accordance with this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall have or acquire a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate to report cyber incidents. For information on obtaining a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate, see http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/Pages/index.aspx.
 
      (d)  Malicious software. When the Contractor or subcontractors discover and isolate malicious software in connection with a reported cyber incident, submit the malicious software to DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) in accordance with instructions provided by DC3 or the Contracting Officer. Do not send the malicious software to the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>(e)  Media preservation and protection. When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest.
 
      (f)  Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis.
 
      (g)  Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.
 
      (h)  DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent practicable, the Contractor shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.<BR><BR>i)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is not created by or for DoD is authorized to be released outside of DoD
 
            (1)  To entities with missions that may be affected by such information;
 
            (2)  To entities that may be called upon to assist in the diagnosis, detection, or mitigation of cyber incidents;
 
            (3)  To Government entities that conduct counterintelligence or law enforcement investigations;
 
            (4)  For national security purposes, including cyber situational awareness and defense purposes (including with Defense Industrial Base (DIB) participants in the program at 32 CFR part 236); or
 
            (5)  To a support services contractor (recipient) that is directly supporting Government activities under a contract that includes the clause at 252.204-7009, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information.
 
      (j)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is created by or for DoD (including the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause) is authorized to be used and released outside of DoD for purposes and activities authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause, and for any other lawful Government purpose or activity, subject to all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy based restrictions on the Governments use and release of such information.
 
      (k)  The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data.<BR><BR>(l)  Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractors responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.
 
      (m)  Subcontracts. The Contractor shall
 
            (1)  Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and
 
            (2)  Require subcontractors to
 
                    (i)  Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and
 
                    (ii)  Provide the incident report number, automatically assigned by DoD, to the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) as soon as practicable, when reporting a cyber incident to DoD as required in paragraph (c) of this clause.<BR><BR>(a)Definitions. As used in this clause -

Computer software means computer programs, source code, source code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae, and related material that would enable the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>For information regarding this solicitation, please contact Howard Nesmith by e-Mail at howard.nesmith@fda.hhs.gov.</p>
<p>Statement of Need:<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), is conducting a study called "monkey cure study 2" to study immunotherapy as treatment for early SIV infection in rhesus macaques.</p>
<p>Background:<br />In an earlier study, three out of four macaques were protected against an SIV viral challenge by immunotherapy plus drug therapy. In contrast, only 1 out of 4 control animals was protected by drugs alone. This study will include a more rigorous viral challenge. FDA previously gave the viral infection a 3-day head start before starting ART drugs. In this experiment, the FDA will wait 5 or 6 days before starting ART. This should increase peak viral load by 100&#8208;fold or more, and it should produce infection in all control animals. The replicating viral load will be fully suppressed by ART drugs, but there will still be residual virus in the latent viral reservoir. This experiment will test whether immunotherapy can control or eradicate the viral reservoir. This is an essential step in the global effort to find a "functional cure" that would allow infected people, particularly children, to live a normal life off drugs.</p>
<p><br />Minimum Technical Capabilities:<br /> - Expertise and Ability to perform a monkey cure studies with a proven track record of<br /> performing "monkey cure" and viral reservoir Experiments <br /> - Ability to transport macaques from CBER to Contractor's facility in under 3 hours<br /> - Ability to reliably infect rhesus macaques with SIV virus by intrarectal route<br /> - Ability to formulate triple antiretroviral drug (ART) cocktail for daily intramuscular injection<br /> - Ability to suppress virus with ART drugs given by injection daily for 20 weeks<br /> - Ability to deliver DNA vaccine by electroporation<br /> - Ability to give rubella/gag vectors by IM injection<br /> - Ability to stop ART and to support sick animals during viral rebound<br /> - Ability to deplete CD8 T cells<br /> - Ability to transport blood and tissue samples back to CBER within 2 hours so that T cells can arrive alive for further testing</p>
<p>Minimum Technical Requirements: (3-Parts)<br />Part I, infection and early ART therapy:<br /> - Eight healthy macaques will be transferred from the CBER monkey colony on Morgan Island to the contractor's facility. Contractor shall quarantine monkeys for 30 days, tested for preexisting antibodies and T cell immunity to SIV, as well as their MHC type. <br /> - Monkeys shall be acclimated to their new surroundings.<br /> - Contractor shall obtain three antiretroviral (ART) drugs and formulate the three drug cocktail and prepare it for use in macaques.<br /> - The macaques shall be infected with live SIVmac251 by the rectal route. The SIV stock will be one that is known to infect all animals, based on prior studies. The contractor shall draw blood daily for six days, and then twice a week for the next 4 weeks to measure viral load by qRT PCR. <br /> - Contractor shall also measure CD4+ T cell counts every two to four weeks.<br /> - ART therapy shall started 5 or 6 days after infection. This will be given daily IM for the next 20 weeks. During this time, Contractor shall draw blood every one to two weeks to measure viral load, CD4+ T cells, and antibodies to the vaccine.</p>
<p><br />Part II, immunization while on ART:<br /> - Once viral replication has been suppressed and virus is undetectable in blood, typically after 2 to 3 weeks on ART, the immunization phase will begin. <br /> - Four animals in the treatment group shall receive DNA vaccine by electroporation given by an experienced veterinarian at 4 weeks. <br /> - Treatment group shall be immunized with rubella/gag vectors given by IM injection at 8 weeks post infection. This sequence DNA vaccine followed by rubella vectors shall be repeated at 12 and 16 weeks. <br /> - Blood shall be tested for specific antibodies and T cells after each immunization.<br />The control group will be treated similarly, except that control DNA vaccine and rubella vectors will lack SIV vaccine inserts.<br /> - During this phase, blood shall be drawn every other week for 6 weeks and then monthly, to determine the antibody and T cell response to vaccination, as well as viral load.</p>
<p><br />Part III, ART withdrawal and viral rebound:<br /> - Once the vaccine group has achieved peak T cell and antibody immunity, usually 4 weeks after the final boost, the contractor shall stop ART drugs and measure viral rebound in both groups. <br /> - Contractor shall measure viral load each week for the next 8 weeks. The control group is expected to have a viral rebound within 4 to 8 weeks in 4/4 animals. <br /> - Considerable effort and skill by the contractor shall be needed to keep the control animals alive during this phase of peak viremia.<br /> - If successful, the vaccinated animals will control viral replication and prevent or delay viral rebound.<br /> - Transient spikes of viremia, called "blips", may occur, and these are separated by quiet intervals with no detectable virus in circulation. Over time, the blips should become less frequent. If a blip in viremia is not controlled by the immune response, this often develops into a full blown infection.<br /> - If animals show no rebound, the Contractor shall give antibodies to CD8+ T cells in order to deplete these cells. A viral rebound would indicate that immune control depends on CD8+ T cells. Absence of a viral rebound suggests complete eradication of the SIV infection with elimination of viral reservoirs.<br /> <br />Work will be performed at the location of the Contractor caring for the rhesus macaques. Throughout above Tasks Contractor shall take a series of blood samples and test for viral load and CD4 count. Contractor shall also provide blood samples to CBER for analysis of specific antibodies and the T cell response to vaccine.</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p><br />1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016) NAM<br />a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br /> <br />5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p><br />(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to joel.heisler@noaa.gov no later than 1200 hrs PDT, Jun 5, 2018.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Joel Heisler at (541) 867-8763 or joel.heisler@noaa.gov for information regarding this solicitation.</p>
