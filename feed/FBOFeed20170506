NAICS Code: 611710, Small Business Size Standard: $15 million. Period of Performance: July 31, 2017 to June 30, 2018.  Statement of work is attached as ATTACHMENT NO. ONE (1).

The consultant will be reimbursed for travel to provide support at a Government site or other site as may be specified and approved by the COTR under this effort. All travel shall be approved, by the COTR, prior to commencement of travel. Consultant shall provide supporting documentation and a detailed breakdown of incurred travel costs with each invoice. 

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable. 

52.212-2  Evaluation-Commercial Items.
EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014) 

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

3.  Past Performance
Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more than cost or price. 
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer¿s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> In formulating the Qualifications submission, potential respondents should consider that FAR 52.219-14, which will be incorporated into any resultant contract, requires the Prime Contractor to perform services under the contract equivalent to 50% or more of the contract value in personnel costs throughout the life of the contract. This is a positive requirement rather than one where an indication of capacity, capability or willingness to meet these requirements would be acceptable. Respondent(s) should demonstrate in their Qualifications submission how they will meet this requirement. Although the specific project effort awarded under any resultant contract is not known at this time, it is believed to be unlikely a Respondent could reasonably expect to meet this FAR requirement where they propose a Prime Contractor role limited to a single discipline, or possibly even multiple disciplines, where the discipline mix proposed leans towards disciplines typically not heavily utilized in A-E Services for Health Facilities Engineering projects.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer and Important Notes All respondents must register on the SAM located At http://www.sam.gov/.</strong></p>
