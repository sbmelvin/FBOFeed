<DESC>The questions have been asked about this requirement.  I will include the questions and answers to them.  The response timeframe of 12 Oct 04, is still the same.
                                                                1. What is the destination point in Dallas, Texas?  Adams Mark Hotel / 400 North Olive Street / Dallas, TX 75201.

2. What time on the 28th of October, here at the base do you want to be picked up and from exact location  I would like the buses to be on base at 0700 for a 0800 departure. I am still working the location(s).

3. What time on the 31st of October, in Dallas, Texas do you want to be picked up? I would like the buses to be at the hotel at 0900 for 1000 departure.

4. How much luggage will be accompanying the passengers? I had a contractor call this morning ask that, they need to know either the approximate weight, which I would assume would be hard to determine. If it makes things easier try to respond back as how many pieces of luggage, each passenger - brings just one piece or what? What kind of luggage is it? Such as... duffle bag and approximate sizes. The buses will have to go through the weigh station and there are weight limits and only so much space available depending upon how many passengers are on each bus. Each person will probably have one duffle bag or suit case weighing approximately 30 pounds and one garment bag weighing 10 pounds. I think a good ball park figure would be 225 pounds per person including baggage. 

All other terms and conditions remain the same.
