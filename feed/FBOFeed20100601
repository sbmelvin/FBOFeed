When the portion of the field being irrigated is finished, the irrigator will be responsible for opening the next group of slide gates and irrigating the next sections of the field until the whole field is irrigated. This may take anywhere from 24 hours to three days depending on the size of the field. The irrigator will be expected to communicate with refuge staff and/or the irrigation district zanjero as appropriate in case of conflicts with field irrigations (e.g. insufficient water, too much water, leaking ditches etc). The irrigator is expected to be able to communicate by cell phone or other means with the refuge staff, supply their own transportation to and around the worksite as well as their own tools.  Some shoveling of soil is expected to efficiently distribute water across all portions of the field.  Minimum tail-water loss should occur. Some liquid fertilizer will be mixed in some of the irrigation water by refuge staff. Refuge staff will coordinate irrigation schedules with the contractor.Interested contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and complete online representation and Certifications (ORCA) at http://www.bpn.gov prior to award of contract.This is a small business set aside.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Canberra Industries, Inc., of Meriden, Connecticut, for the acquisition of two 4-B Sealed Hand/Cuff/Foot Monitors to supplement the monitors currently being used in the NIST Center for Neutron Research.

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

NIST currently utilizes an inventory of eight Canberra hand and foot contamination monitors throughout the site.  Due to the expansion of the NIST Center for Neutron Research(NCNR) facility, two additional Canberra hand and foot contamination monitors are needed for this new additional space.  Adding two new Canberra monitors will allow NIST significant savings by avoiding orientation and training costs for 2500+ users and staff that would be necessitated by purchasing monitors from another source.  In addition, NIST has significant inventories of spare and replacement parts for the Canberra monitors, as well as tools and equipment specific to Canberra monitors.  Adding monitors to the NCNR from another manufacturer would be cost prohibitive.

Canberra Industries, Inc. is the only contractor who can provide the Canberra Sirius 4-B Sealed Hand/Cuff/Foot Monitors that meet NISTs requirements.  Therefore, Canberra Industries, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the required Canberra Sirius 4-B Sealed Hand/Cuff/Foot Monitors.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (Eastern) on May 12, 2010.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement for X-Ray Survey Equipment for evaluation and potential fielding to Navy end users in order to assure the Navy that x-ray machines are in compliance with Navy and Federal regulations. The Navy Radiological Systems Performance Evaluation Manual (NRSPEM) establishes for diagnostic radiological systems periodicity of surveys, parameters to be measured, training and qualification of surveyors and reporting requirements. The NRSPEM states parameters such as radiation exposure reproducibility, timer reproducibility, linearity of mA/mAs, kilovoltage accuracy and beam quality.  X-ray quality assurance (QA) requires that the output of diagnostic x-ray units is monitored to ensure that the x-ray system remains within calibration limits and patient dose is controlled. The Navy is looking to supply and supplement various commands with x-ray survey equipment capability.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to award a contract to manufacture three Nickel Aluminum Bronze (Ni-Al-Brz MIL-B-24480 Rev A.) propeller castings.  The intended period of performance is from the date of award through 3 years thereafter, with the first casting to be delivered 15 months after contract award.  NSWCCD intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract to Rolls Royce Naval Marine (RRNM) located in Pascagoula, MS.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
RRNM is the only privately held facility in the United States capable of casting, machining, and finishing large Fixed Pitch Propellers of the size and weight similar to the ones that will be procured under the resultant contract.  RRNM holds a DoD security clearance and has the capability/resources to pour a casting of up to 50,000 lbs which are critical requirements of this program.  RRNM has successfully completed similar efforts for the Navy under contracts N00167-04-C-0006 and N00167-05-C-0010.  The risk, time and cost associated with awarding to a contractor that does not already possess these capabilities from both a facilities and engineering view point would be unacceptable. The RFP will be issued on or about 01 July 2010 to RRNM and the date for receipt of the proposal will be 30 days thereafter.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which will be considered by this agency.  See note (22).

Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division has a requirement for a non-commercial, competitive procurement for various build-to-print machine shop requirements to support a wide variety of military projects including but not limited to the Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) program.  The government anticipates awarding multiple 5-year IDIQ type contracts with an option for 5 additional years to multiple vendors in accordance with FAR 16.5.  The contract will have a minimum of $10,000.  The maximum amount to be awarded across all contracts will be $25,000,000 over the 10-year contract period.  Two sample parts will be solicited in the initial solicitation and utilized to determine who will receive award of the basic contracts.  The award decision will be based on technical go/no go, past performance, and price with past performance being more important than price.  Technical go/no go will be evaluated on the contractors ability to propose on both samples required by the solicitation.  Past performance will be evaluated on the contractor's ability to demonstrate past experience on similar requirements.  Delivery requirements will be in accordance with the delivery terms outlined in each individual delivery order.  Delivery will be FOB Destination, NSWC-CRANE, Crane, IN 47522-5000.  Inspection and acceptance will be at destination.  Note: This is a 100% Small Business Set Aside.
Explicit access of drawings for the samples included in the solicitation will be available at FedBizOpps.  Note: Access to drawings requires contractors to be active in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Joint Certificate Program (JCP).                             
It is anticipated that the contractor will require access to classified information to perform under this contract.  As such, DD254 documentation will be executed prior to the award of this contract to ensure access to the required classified data.
All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to Crane web site, FedBizOpps and NECO.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor the Crane web site, FedBizOpps and NECO for amendments that may be issued to this synopsis.

The Office of Naval Research has requested the LMC CAD/CAC algorithms be adapted to a variety of systems.  Only LMC has the unique knowledge base, the facilities, and the experienced personnel necessary to successfully conduct the work.  LMC has invested over nine years in gaining the unique knowledge, insight, and skills necessary for this type of work. Additionally, the algorithms developed by LMC represent many work years under other LMC/DOD contracts and LMC's own independent research and development (IRAD).  The algorithms are very sophisticated and require specialized knowledge to use properly thus another vendor cannot easily or cost-effectively duplicate them.  Questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist via e-mail at Stacy.Figlinski@navy.mil.  Technical questions should be provided in written form per email so that they may be passed on to the appropriate technical expert for a reply.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Work under this MATOC may also include the design and the construction of various types of facilities including but not limited to, administrative, recreational, educational, religious, medical, and training type as well as their corresponding support facilities. Generally, however, task orders anticipated to be issued under this MATOC will be primarily for new, vertical construction and associated site work.  <BR><BR>The scope of the seed task order, which will be the first task order awarded, involves the construction of a new Intermediate School (IS) to serve 725 students, grades 5 and 6.

Options may also be included in the seed task order.  <BR><BR>Evaluation Criteria:  As this is a solicitation for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), a seed task order will be provided for purposes of evaluation and in rendering the best value decision.  Only that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value of those offerors selected to be in the MATOC pool, if any, will also be awarded the seed task order.

Factor 3 is equal in importance to Factor 2 and more important than Factor 4. <BR><BR>Price:  All non-cost factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.<BR><BR>Award will be made to those Offerors whose technical submittal and price proposal contain the combination of the criteria requested that offers the best value to the Government. Proposals shall include sufficient detailed information to allow complete evaluation. The Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers.

<DESC>VA National Center for PTSD 
Statement of Work Request
2/11/2010

The National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) web site http://www.ptsd.va.gov is a resource for anyone investigating PTSD, whether for professional or personal reasons.  Fact sheets, clinical resources, and research links provide information to clinicians as well as the general public.  The Center is now looking to expand its use of video on the web.  In our increasingly visual culture, documentary testimonials facilitate the communication of important information. Video can add an emotional quality often lacking in text.  It will bring a human element to the material that will help connect the viewer to the content.  

Project:  To produce three high definition video profiles for the National Center's website www.ptsd.va.gov.  
   
DESCRIPTION: We are looking for an experienced, skilled photo journalist/filmmaker and a production company that will work with our in house producer/director (PD) to create three PTSD centered multi-layered profiles. The goal is to use a combination of still photography, audio, video, music, graphics, text, and stock footage to create informative and visually evocative segments to post on our website.  These photographic/video profiles will be used to explain to Veterans and the public, fundamental information about PTSD, including how to recognize the symptoms of PTSD, and what PTSD treatments are available.  Each profile will be uploaded onto our website in at least three segments:  A main segment (5 - 7 minutes), and three supporting segments (2 - 3 minutes each).  The main segment will focus on the individual with PTSD and the supporting segments may also include family members, friends, and/or clinicians, all to be determined in the research phase of the production.  The total amount of edited video for each complete profile will be approximately 12 to 17 minutes.

WORK REQUIREMENTS: 

The National Center for PTSD has an in-house producer director (PD) that will oversee and approve all aspects of production.  The PD will also identify subjects and associated interviewees, serve as the point of contact for scheduling interviews, and potentially conduct the interviews.  

The contractor will work closely with the PD throughout the preparation for the shoots.  The contractor will identify and provide all crew (photo journalist/filmmaker, sound, lights, production help, and the editor) and equipment (camera, lighting, audio, editing equipment, etc.) necessary to complete the production of videos.  The contractor will also be responsible for studio space, (if necessary), lodging, and travel for crew and organizing all production needs in the field.  Key personnel and equipment will be approved by the PD prior to filming.  Shooting will be in HD format using a stills camera on par with or of similar quality to a Cannon D7, and for video where the D7 is not appropriate a video camera on par with a SonyEX3 complete with adaptors for wide angle and other cinematic lenses.  A selection of radio microphones and a lighting kit to be determined by the PD and the photojournalist/filmmaker will also be supplied by the contractor.  At the completion of each shoot, copies of all footage shot plus transcripts of interviews will be delivered to the National Center ready for unwrapping or uploading into Final Cut Studio.  Still pictures will be digitally captured, color corrected, and sent to the Center for viewing. 

In the post production phase, the contractor will hire an editor who is an expert with Final Cut Studio which will be used as the editing program.  The PD will approve the editor and will provide the editor with selects and work closely with the editor through to completion. The PD will have final approval on all the independent elements that are used in the film, including music (up to one original theme per profile), graphics, and sound effects.   Once the final cut is approved, the contractor under the supervision of the PD will be responsible for all required finishing of the product, including but not exclusive to a sound edit and mix and color correct.    

Interviews will be shot on locations within the continental United States.  It is our hope to consolidate the interview locations, but the subjects have yet to be identified.

NOTE:  We have considered a variety of methods to produce these videos including moving picture, a combination of stills and video, using a second camera during interviews, exploring "quiet" as a story telling technique, etc.  We have also considered shooting the profiles in two phases: the first is a research / pre-interview phase for stills photography with some video. This would focus on the main character.  This would be followed by a second, separate phase for more photography, both still and video, as well as interviews and footage with supporting characters such as treating clinicians.  We would also consider the contractor proposals for filming these profiles that will make the end product artistic, accessible and believable. For a guide to the kind of work we are looking for please visit the following sites:  http://www.mediastorms.org or http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/1-in-8-million/index.html

Proposed Timeline:	Month 1	Month 2	Month 3	Months 4-6	Months 7-12
Meeting between PD and contractor to discuss production plans, schedule and technical requirements 	x				
Contractor submits 
production schedule	x				
 PD reviews proposal and, if necessary, requests modifications.	x				
Research trip/location scout may include stills photography 	x	x	x		
Contractor preps for and organizes field production		x	x		
Contractor and PD shoot interviews and b-roll on location			x	x	
Post Production edits, music, finished products including 508 compliance				x	x


Deliverables:
The contractor will use the video footage, still photographs, and other materials to produce a series of three profiles for the website.  These profiles will be made up of 3 components:
1)	A short clip (less than 1 minute) to attract the viewer into the larger story.  This may be audio/stills, audio/video or a combination to be determined by PD.
2)	The primary segment (approximately 7 minutes) featuring an individual with PTSD, will feature stills, video, audio, interview, and b-roll.  This may also include music, text, graphics and/or narration.
3)	Supporting segments (approximately 2-3 minutes each).





Profile =






All digital footage and photographs will be the property of the National Center for PTSD.


Option Year 2
To renew contract to produce three additional profiles.  

Option Year 3
To renew contract to produce three additional profiles.

Should a future requirement(s) evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated the period of performance will be 30 September 2010 to 29 September 2011. <br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:<br />MacDill AFB requires access to polling data obtained in calendar year 2005-2010 and subsequent periods by Gallup World PollTM Database and Knowledge System Support to Theater Strategy Assessment, (TSA), Model Refinement to conduct and collect wide-ranging poll data for the 130 countries within and outside the USCENTCOM Area of Responsibility, (AOR). This information gives specific insight into population attitudes in the USCENTCOM Area of Responsibility (AOR) regarding such topics as national leadership, law and order, availability of food and shelter, availability of employment opportunities, general health and well-being, and opportunity for citizen engagement in self and national determination. We also require certain demographic data on the population polled which gives insight into current economic status, religious preference, ethnic origin, level of literacy, and educational background. Access to polling data on as many countries as possible from outside the USCENTCOM AOR is also necessary for comparative analysis purposes to properly value results from the USCENTCOM AOR and to show interaction with other areas of immediate concern that directly impact the USCENTCOM AOR. We require access to the above polling data using a statistical analysis software interface that allows for quantitative analysis of trends and interactions between different data streams for up to 12 analysts simultaneously. We require the ability to export key data from the dataset to MS Excel for incorporation into a Value Focused Thinking strategic assessment model and to create visual representations of data trends for briefings to senior decision makers. We require training for analysts that will be using the statistical analysis software interface.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System is 541910 and the size standard is $6.5M. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 10:00 AM local time on 7 June 2010. Such information will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice.

<p>Description:</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to be determine the availability and capability of small business including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantage, HUB Zone firms; veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small businesses. This information is being sought for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items or services herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this source sought. Any response received will not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>No official solicitation currently exists in connection to this request for Sources Sought. If in the future an official solicitation is released, there is no guarantee that sources responding to this Sources Sought will be included on the source list.</p>
<p>**NO QUESTIONS WILL BE ENTERTAINED**</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS), Division of Acquisition Operations (DAO) is seeking to identify sources with capabilities or prior experience in examining the effects of climate change on the occurrence of ciguatoxin-producing dinoflagellates and ciguatoxic fish, and the incidence of ciguatera in humans, in the Caribbean (U.S. Virgin Islands).</p>
<p>Impact of Climate on Ciguatoxin-Producing Dinoflagellates and Ciguatera Fish Poisoning Disease</p>
<p>This requirement is written in the interest of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mission to ensure the safety of seafood to the consumer. The requirement augments parallel studies sponsored by CDC to address public health issues related to global climate change and ciguatera. This requirement will examine the effects of climate change on the occurrence of ciguatoxin-producing dinoflagellates and ciguatoxic fish, and the incidence of ciguatera in humans, in the Caribbean (U.S. Virgin Islands). The project explores the hypothesis that climatic disturbances in reef areas affect the growth of these organisms, with subsequent and predictable changes in fish toxicity. Evidence is accumulating that the geographical distribution of ciguatoxin-producing dinoflagellates (Gambierdiscus spp.) and toxic fish are expanding, and linked to climate change. This effort shall support the collection of new environmental information, which will compliment CDC sponsored clinical and epidemiological studies of ciguatera. Knowledge of the effects of climate on the occurrence of ciguatoxin-producing dinoflagellates, and their linkages to toxic fish, will improve the ability of FDA to monitor and control this critical food safety issue. This project will provide unique benefits to common goals of FDA and CDC in prevention of seafood-related illnesses.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in this announcement. This request is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this announcement. Responses must be sent to this notice no later than 10:00 a.m. EST on June 15, 2010 submitted by email to patricia.pemberton@fda.hhs.gov , Patricia Pemberton, Contract Specialist for consideration. Responses to this announcement will not be returned, nor will there be any ensuing discussions or debriefings of any responses. Interested parties may submit a capability statement. Please be advised the information will not be returned to the sender.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties are expected to review this notice and the draft Statement of Work to familiarize themselves with the requirements of this project.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span><br /><br />The Chemical Biology Consortium (CBC) has been developed by the Office of the Director (OD), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI) in conjunction with the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and the OD, to facilitate the discovery and development of new agents to treat and diagnose cancer. The goal of the CBC is to develop a network of academic and private drug discovery efforts that along with DCTD's current early development resources will establish a complete drug discovery and development platform for oncology therapeutics. This network of multidisciplinary scientific expertise, along with varied technical and infrastructure resources within the network, will work together to support execution of drug discovery and development projects from discovery to first in human studies in a team centric approach. One critical infrastructure resource that this platform will require is chemical repository services to function as the network's central resource to procure, receive, analyze, store, track and distribute chemical compounds expected to be generated throughout project execution. Our current assessment of the progress of this program anticipates the generation and management of arrayed libraries built from up to 250,000 diverse compounds. The compounds will be acquired from commercial and other sources. We will also require management (acquisition, analysis, distribution and storage) of 2,500-5,000 CBC member generated dry samples in the first year and 5,000-7,000 dry samples in the second year. The number is expected to grow with the addition of nearly 7,500-15,000 compounds per year for the subsequent years.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives:<br /><br /></span>The purpose of this Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is to identify qualified small business concerns including HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses, women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.

<DESC>NOTICE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. NOAA intends to award a procurement to provide genotype and statistical analysis for salmon. The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in determining the extent of the small business and socio-economic market for the type of work described herein. The intent of the announcement is to identify sources that are qualified Small Business concerns capable of <br />supporting the operations of Russian River, California fish hatchery facilities owned by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and operated by the California Department of Fish and Game, by providing genetic data and analysis on fish raised and spawned at these facilities, as well as technical expertise regarding their effects on US Endangered Species Act-listed coho salmon and steelhead both in the Russian River basin and beyond. Genetic broodstock management practices have been developed to avoid mating of close relatives and consequent inbreeding depression. Molecular genetic data from 18 microsatellite genes are collected, coefficients of relatedness estimated and then used to construct a breeding matrix which specifies optimal, acceptable and unacceptable mating partners for every reproductively mature fish. The services will include the following: (1) Evaluation of coho salmon production by genetic analysis of broodstock and creation of matrices for potential breeding partners in the 2009-10 breeding season; (2) Evaluation of steelhead production by genetic analysis of broodstock from the 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 breeding seasons to estimate inbreeding and hatchery selection; and (3) Evaluation of differentiation of steelhead trout produced at WSH and CVFF, with those born in natural areas through genetic analysis of both groups of fish. It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price contract for the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Western Acquisition Division (WAD) will be awarded. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). NOTE: THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. No solicitation document is available.

<DESC>Title: <br />The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking sources for an Enterprise Cyber Forensics System (ECFS).
<p>Description:<br />The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking sources for Enterprise Cyber Forensics System (ECFS) technologies that are currently available in the marketplace. This is a Sources Sought Notice only and vendors will not be compensated for the information provided. No solicitation will be issued at this time.</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) mission is to protect the Nation's transportation systems and to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce. To support this mission, TSA is evaluating Enterprise Cyber Forensics System (ECFS) products/solutions that can provide the ability to scan, capture, identify, report, and resolve information technology forensics issues across the entire TSA environment. The product/solution should allow TSA forensics users to address insider threats, data leakage, IT asset misuse, anomaly detection, malicious code and activity identification, compliance verification, and e-discovery procedures. The ECFS system should also allow for the integration with ArcSight Security Information and Event Management tools and have reporting capabilities that will allow TSA leadership to access information as needed.</p>
<p>Please provide a detailed description on how the product works and what differentiates it in the Enterprise Cyber Forensics System market space. Please include at a minimum the following information:</p>
<p>&bull;Describe how your product supports legal e-discovery processes and what mechanisms are available for integrating with legal tools such as Concordance or Summation.</p>

Are there any structures in your product to allow for known forensics exceptions on a system or user basis depending on Active Directory user or group membership, or other AD structure? Does any mechanism exist to establish an expected baseline for end user and system configuration (e.g. settings that do not report for specific users/machines to leverage external media, where as an exception would be identified for other users that are not external media users)?</p>
<p>&bull;Describe any desktop product integrations that your product supports. Please describe end point protection integration with disk and file level encryption, personal firewall/IDS systems, and integration with system and software management tools.</p>
<p>&bull;Please describe any functions used to manage and control information in the Enterprise Cyber Forensics System, and any other options for users to manage/track forensic information. Describe any Role Based Access Control (RBAC) structure your product supports and the activities allowed by the RBAC structure.</p>
<p>&bull;Describe any knowledge base or mechanism that is available for identifying suspicious system activities including any known exploits that could assist TSA personnel to quickly identify unauthorized and malicious system activity.</p>
<p>&bull;Describe any remediation activities your product supports to remove identified threats while sweeping across the enterprise for known malicious code.</p>
<p>&bull;Describe the reporting functionality that the product provides, and the extent to which it can be customized to provide unique and customizable reports. Describe reporting dashboards that are available for Sr. Management reporting and monitoring.</p>
<p>&bull;Describe authentication and authorization (A&amp;A) integrations and mechanisms including Single Sign On and multifactor authentication mechanisms your product supports for Active Directory environments. Describe any remote access mechanisms that your product provides.</p>

On October 28, 2009, President Barack Obama signed the FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) (H.R. 2647) into law, which became Public Law No: 111-84.  The law contains provisions for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to commence a three-year study to assess the benefits, feasibility, and advisability of using service/therapy dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of veterans with physical or mental injuries or disabilities, including post-traumatic stress disorder.  As a result, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking to partner with nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations that: (A) are willing to travel to a site that is yet to be determined, at no cost to the government, to provide the service/therapy dog; (B) would not charge veterans who participate in the study fees for the dogs, services, or lodging that they provide; (C) have standard screening procedures in place for all potential users of service/therapy dogs that veterans must pass in order to be placed with a service/therapy dog; (D) have standards which are followed for care of service/therapy dog in home settings of the veterans, ensuring well-being of the animal; and, (E) are accredited by Assistance Dogs Partners or Assistance Dogs International, with demonstrated experience, national scope, and recognized leadership and expertise in the training of service dogs for persons with mental illness and education in the use of service dogs.  The following information and excerpt from the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, Sec. 1077. Department of Veterans Affairs Use of Service Dogs for the Treatment or Rehabilitation of Veterans with Physical or Mental Injuries or Disabilities, is provided to assist parties in determining their interest in participating in the study.  

The Secretary shall reimburse partners $10,000 for each dog provided to a veteran who enrolls in the study and successfully completes a training program offered by one of the partners.  Participation: (1) IN GENERAL- As part of the study, the Secretary shall arrange for the provision of a service dog to the greater of the following: (A) 200 veterans, (B) a sufficient number of such veterans to produce scientifically valid results with respect to assessing the benefits and costs of the use of such dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of such veterans; (2) NUMBER OF VETERANS - The Department of Veterans Affairs may provide dogs to fewer than 200 veterans if, despite its sustained and repeated efforts, it is unable to recruit 200 veterans to participate in the study.  OPTION FOR OWNERSHIP OF, AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR, THE DOG AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE STUDY - At the end of the study the veteran will have the option of ownership of the dog.  If the veteran does not wish to retain the dog, the 501(c)(3) organization that provided the dog will be responsible for caring for or appropriately placing the dog.  In any case after completion of the study, or if and when the veteran chooses to not participate in the study until completion, further responsibility by the Department of Veterans Affairs for any benefits in this provision will cease. Further, the Department of Veterans Affairs' liability related to the dog will cease.  The study under this section is subject to the availability of appropriations provided to the Department of Veterans Affairs for such purpose.

<DESC><p><strong>INDUSTRY FORUM FOR WESTERN GROUP MHPI, 15 JUNE 2010.</strong>&nbsp; The Department of Air Force is seeking qualified entities for a housing privatization project at four Air Forces Bases across the United States, collectively referred to as the Western Group: Beale AFB, California; F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming; Malmstrom AFB, Montana; and Whiteman AFB, Missouri. The project is a real estate transaction to privatize military family housing at the Western Group AFBs, and it provides a unique opportunity for top quality firms to assist in the development, operation and financing of this family housing privatization effort. Specifically, the Air Force is seeking qualified entities to own, renovate, operate, and maintain 3,264 Family Housing Units at these bases for the benefit of Air Force families for at least 50 years. The project will include conveyance of 4,047 existing units. The project will require demolition of 1,497 units and construction of 714 units. The Air Force will lease approximately 1,352 acres of land on 34 parcels (11 parcels at F.E. Warren AFB for 336 acres; 7 parcels at Malmstrom AFB for 333 acres; 9 parcels at Whiteman AFB, for 427 acres; 7 parcels at Beale AFB for 256 acres, and an additional 2 parcels for 60 acres at Malmstrom AFB, 3 parcels for 324 acres at Beale AFB, and 1 parcel for 28 acres at Whiteman AFB for temporary conveyance) for the 50-year life of the project. The Air Force's goal is to provide military families access to safe, quality, affordable, well-maintained housing in a community where they will choose to live. An Industry Forum will be conducted on June 15, 2010 at the Little American Hotel &amp; Resort, Cheyenne, WY. The purpose of the forum is to provide pertinent information on the project. A corresponding statement of need is expected to be released in June 2010. To register for this forum, please visit http://amafpress.com/index.php.</p>

<DESC>Meeting for Low Cost Guided Imaging Rocket (LOGIR) Technology Demonstration Project, herein after called LOGIR Day.  This notice is been posted under solicitation number N68936-10-R-0054.  The Department of the Navy (DON) is hosting the LOGIR Day 0800 - 1500 on 30 June 2010.  The purpose of LOGIR Day is to disseminate information to defense industry regarding the final project accomplishments in the Science & Technology (S&T) phase; results of recent live fire tests; and improve industry understanding of the Government technology efforts.
Background:  LOGIR is a surface warfare (SUW) capability directed at countering the Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FIAC) threat and consists of a helicopter launch platform with its associated targeting system, a smart launcher, and guided precision rocket. The guided rocket consists of a Guidance and Control (G&C) section mated to a 2.75 inch Hydra-70 rocket motor with a M151 warhead.  The G&C system provides inertial mid-course guidance with imaging infrared (IIR) terminal homing.  The system provides dramatically improved capability to engage FIAC due to improved range and short target engagement timelines, both of which reduce pilot exposure.  It does so at a low cost that permits adequate procurement for use in the field as well as for training.
 Visit Request:  This meeting will be unclassified.  Participants who plan to attend must have a valid visit request on file with Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake Security Division, (Code N21NPW). Visit request data needs to be submitted to China Lake Security Not Later Than (NLT) 18 June 2010. Commercial phone number is 760-939-3160. FAX number is 760-939-3996.  Contractors must submit a visit authorization request on the NAWS Visit Request / Visitor Clearance Data form, (NAWS 5521/3 Rev. 09-09). For further information contact the Security Division at 760-939-3160. This meeting is limited to DoD and DoD contractors only. (Distribution Statement D.)

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<DESC>The Division of Information Technology and Management's Branch of Information Technology has a requirement for contract support to implement the Ektron CMS400.net Content Management System (CMS).  The CMS will manage the Web sites of approximately 550 National Wildlife Refuges and 37 Wetland Management Districts, collectively known as field stations in the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS), a program within the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The branch is responsible for the design, development, implementation, and deployment of the CMS for the NWRS and is working with a CMS project team (Team), comprised of subject matter experts from the FWS' eight Regions across the United States, to complete the effort.
The NWRS is implementing a CMS to better serve its audiences with unified design, content and navigation Web site layout.  Primary audiences are:
-Members of the public who want to visit wildlife refuges to pursue wildlife-dependent recreation, often called "Big 6" public priority recreational uses.-Wildlife or environmental activists and other members of the public who are interested in getting better acquainted with the programs, policies and recreation associated with national wildlife refuges.-Instructors, students and members of the public who are interested in learning about wildlife and wild land resources of the Refuge System.-Partner organizations, including groups that hold similar interests as those of the Refuge System.-Refuge Friends who have organized into approximately 200 nonprofit organizations to assist individual national wildlife refuges.-Individuals who seek to volunteer their time on behalf of national wildlife refuges.-Employees of the Fish & Wildlife Service, and in particular, employees of the National Wildlife Refuge System.
The CMS project has been divided into three sub-projects:  1) Purchase and install the CMS software, 2)  develop a common Web site design for the NWRS and 3)  integrate that design into the CMS software and  create the NWRS Web sites and supporting processes, documentation, and training.  The first sub-project is complete-the FWS has purchased the CMS software and has installed it in accordance with Ektron's initial recommendations.  The second sub-project will produce 13 Web page templates, an information architecture (IA), and wireframes for the new NWRS Web sites under a separate contract (estimated completion date is August 31, 2010).  The goal of the third sub-project, covered under the statement of work, is to integrate these templates, the IA, and the wireframes into the CMS to support the field stations of the NWRS. All the field station Web sites will be under the umbrella of the CMS and the page templates when the project is complete.  Firms wishing to compete for the integration contract will be provided the deliverables produced by the design contractor.
The contractor shall produce a fully functioning, integrated CMS, bringing together the Ektron software and the completed page templates.  This includes verifying the installation of the software and configuring all necessary components and features onto the FWS servers in compliance with the Branch of Communication Technology (BCT) and Team requirements.  The BCT, a branch within the FWS Division of Information Resources and Technology Management and located in Lakewood, Colorado; houses and manages all software and hardware related to this project.
Successful completion of this project will be demonstrated by a correctly configured, fully functioning CMS solution that is ready to present to field stations for content migration and site launch.

Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005.

Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language below, it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***</p>
<p>***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-39.***</p>
<p>*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423490 with a small business size standard of 100 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***</p>
<p>*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) 2D X-Ray Detector System for Back Reflection Laue Camera System. ***</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a digital two-dimensional (2D) X-ray detector system, which shall replace an existing Polaroid XR-7 film-based detector on a back reflection Laue camera. The new detector shall be permanently installed in this Laue camera system and must be compatible with it. Compatibility will be determined by the effective active area, the pixel resolution, the physical dimensions of the detector, the sensitivity of the detector, and the data acquisition and camera control system.</p>
<p>***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) 2D X-Ray Detector System, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>1. The effective useful active area of the detector including the center hole must be larger than 3.5" (89mm) by 4.0" (102mm). Stronger consideration will be given for a system that provides a larger detector area.<br />2. The effective pixel size must be less than or equal to 0.08mm. Thus, the minimum acceptable number of pixels for an effective area of 89mm by 102mm is 1113 pixels by 1275 pixels. Stronger consideration will be given for a system that provides a smaller pixel size.<br />3. The available space for the detector, measured from the beam axis, is 1 foot (300mm) below, 1 foot (300mm) to each side, and 2 feet (600mm) above. The detector thickness (in the beam direction) shall be less than or equal to 6" (150mm). The detector must allow the X-ray beam to pass through it, consistent with a back reflection Laue geometry.<br />4. The detector shall provide sensitivity similar to or better than the Polaroid Type 57 film that is being replaced and shall have an operational range of at least 5 keV to 25 keV with at least 12 bit digitization. Stronger consideration will be given for a system that provides higher sensitivity.<br />5. The detector system shall include all ancillary electronics and computer hardware and software for detector control and data processing/storage. The software interface shall include control of video gain, exposure time, binning, and background subtraction. The computer must use Windows XP Professional or Windows XP Professional x64 for compatibility with NIST IT security requirements.<br /><br />Installation/Warranty:</p>
<p>1. The Contractor shall provide full installation instructions. In lieu of on-site installation and training by the contractor, the contractor shall guarantee full phone access by a technician who is an expert in the installation, set-up, operation, trouble shooting and maintenance of the system</p>
<p>2. The Contractor shall provide a minimum of a One (1) Year Warranty. Contractor shall state the warranty coverage provided.</p>
<p>Please provide a description of the warranty provided for this equipment. Please include the following details:</p>
<p>1. Length of warranty<br />2. What is included? (Parts, Labor)<br />3. Is the warranty on-site or return to vendor?<br />a. If on-site is travel included?<br />b. If return to vendor is shipping to and from NIST included?<br />Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, past performance, and price will be considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Minimum Specifications," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.</p>
<p>Technical capability, and past performance, when combined, shall be more important than price. If Technical Capability, and Past Performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.</p>
<p>Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements. NIST will give stronger preference to offerors whose quoted equipment exceeds minimum requirements stated below.</p>
<p>Stronger Considerations:</p>
<p>Under the Technical Capability factor, stronger consideration will be given for a system that provides larger detector area, smaller pixel size, and higher sensitivity.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:</p>
<p>1. Visual and physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.<br />2. Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications. The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor.</p>

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
(I) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT (II) PAST PERFORMANCE (III) PRICE 
The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the two non-price factors. (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.)
Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, the Government will rate the products offered as either technically acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal technically unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 
Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii). Under this factor, the Government will rate past performance as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 
For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price. 
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. 
(b) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation. Offerors technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation. Items offered, as provided in Offerors technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable. Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 
(c) Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has an acceptable record of past performance. A proposal that receives a rating of acceptable on past performance is one that demonstrates little anticipated risk in the areas of quality of the product, timely delivery, and customer satisfaction. Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate acceptable past performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 
The evaluation may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies and subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement. 
Offers that lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any Offerors proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government. Thus, the Contracting Officer may determine it is an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation. Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. 
(d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ . 
All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes will be accepted via email at lenette.santana@navy.mil or facsimile at 805-982-2558. Quotes over 10 pages in total will NOT be accepted by facsimile. Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements. 
This announcement will close at 12:00 PM PST on 17 June 2010. Contact Lenette Santana who can be reached at 805-982-2193 or email lenette.santana@navy.mil. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.

<p><br />USCG C2CEN SEAWATCH-378<br />EQUIPMENT PURCHASE<br />Justification for other than full and open competition. (JOTFOC)<br />(a) Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As a minimum, each justification shall include the following information: <br />(1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition." <br />United States Coast Guard Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN), Portsmouth Virginia</p>
<p>(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. <br />C2CEN requires the items listed in section 3 that will be used on SEAWATCH-378 equipment suite for prototype development and acceptance testing. The equipment required for SEAWATCH-378 is specified by the Fast Response Cutter (FRC) Circular of Requirements (COR) Section 425-1.1, scaled to 378-foot High Endurance Cutter (WHEC) platform. C2CEN is developing and delivering Government Furnished Information (GFI) software, SEAWATCH-378, to be used on WHEC's as part of the Command and Control System technology refreshment.</p>
<p>The requirement for the WHEC Bridge to meet TEMPEST level 2 standards limits the number of possible Commercial off the Shelf Products.</p>
<p><br />(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Global Mission Group:</p>
<p>1. XViz System Monitoring License<br />2. Software Maint. for 1 Yr Period</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ESTIMATED total amount for all these items: $14,000.00</p>
<p><br />(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. <br />6.302-1 (2)(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components there, of, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.</p>
<p>(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.<br />Vendors and model numbers have been dictated by the FRC-B COR and the DISA. Additionally, the equipment is specified by the SEAWATCH System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Plan and System Lifecycle Maintenance Plan (SLMP).</p>
<p>The API DHL-105 Rose Fiber KVM Extender is the only commercial KVM extender that meets the TEMPEST Level 2 standards as suggested by the CTTA.</p>
<p>(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.<br />Requirement shall be posted on FED BIZ OPS as Brand, Model and Specifications Specific; there is no restriction on the selection of vendors.</p>
<p>API is the only company that sells KVM Extender with a TEMPEST level 2 certification.</p>
<p>The original System Monitor Software order was put up for full and open competition to supply a SEAWATCH System Monitoring application. The sources that submitted a proposal were Global Mission Systems, Solarwinds, and Zyrion. The result was that the Global Mission Systems' XCAFE proposed both the lowest price for the system and offered the highest degree of conformity to the SEAWATCH system requirements.</p>
<p><br />(7) A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.<br />The best price available will be selected for the required equipment from multiple vendor quotes. And comparison to past purchases via USCG Contracts.</p>
<p>(8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. <br />For those items not available from GSA schedules, market research using the internet has identified the most economical sources.</p>
<p>C2Cen has previously performed market research to determine the best system monitoring software to meet our approved SEAWATCH requirements. The result was that the Global Mission Systems' XCAFE proposed both the lowest price for the system and offered the highest degree of conformity to the SEAWATCH system requirements.</p>
<p><br />(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: <br />Technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work and purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition are not available because the Commercial Funded Equipment (CFE) is called out in the COR and the hardware and software required by the DISA application is dictated by the DISA.</p>
<p>The Global Mission Systems' XCAFE xBin framework component of xViz Visualization and Monitoring Product was selected during the first order by full and open competition. It is deployed on SEAWATCH FRC and is on the C2CEN SEAWATCH baseline and core software build list. If another brand and source were to be used for SEAWATCH-378, the entire SEAWATCH System Monitoring application would have to be redesigned and tested at considerable cost to the government.</p>
<p>Government Estimate for duplication cost is $3.5 Million.</p>
<p>(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.<br />The original order for a system monitoring software was put up for full and open competition to supply a SEAWATCH System Monitoring application. The sources that submitted a proposal were Global Mission Systems, Solarwinds, and Zyrion. Global Mission Systems' XCAFE was selected based on cost and ability to conform to all SEAWATCH FRC System Monitoring requirements.</p>
<p>(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. <br />None required. Any current vendor that can meet the specific brand name, model, and specifications called out in the FRC COR is acceptable.</p>
<p>(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.<br />(a) The requirement to purchase precise brand, model, and specification equipment for development of GFI for installation on CFE is valid. This requirement restricts competition to those vendors capable of providing the exact equipment specified but does not prohibit competition between similar vendors.</p>
<p>(b) Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel. <br />The FRC COR requirement has been certified and accepted by the Coast Guard Acquisitions directorate, CG-9; as the specifications and performance standards for the Fast Response Cutter.</p>
<p>SEAWATCH-378 is a variant of the SEAWATCH Core System that has been scaled to the 378-ft WHEC platform.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

 STATEMENT OF WORK

VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (VHA)
Workshop on Financial Policies and Procedures for VA affiliated 
Nonprofit Research and Education Corporations (NPCs)


Project description/scope of work:
 
VHA is seeking to conduct comprehensive workshop on financial policies and procedures to ensure sound financial management and effective internal controls among the 84 VA-affiliated nonprofit research and education corporations (NPCs).  In 1988, Congress authorized VA medical centers to establish NPCs to administer non-VA federal and private sector funds provided in support of research and education performed at VA medical centers.  

The May 5, 2008, OIG report on five NPCs and on VHA oversight of the NPCs contained the following findings:  "NPCs did not have adequate controls to manage funds" and "NPCs did not adequately segregate financial duties."  The workshop described in this statement of work will increase NPC awareness of the OIG findings and will provide tools to improve NPC financial management.  Offering this training will also fulfill one component of VHA's commitment to improve NPC oversight.

The target audience is the NPC management team (i.e., executive director and senior financial personnel) and the Board Treasurer of the VA NPCs.  This will be an invitation only event for a limited number of the target audience.  Expected attendance will be 99 people.

The program will provide a minimum of 10 hours of training for attendees.

The goal of the training is to:

1.	Provide an overview on rationale for written financial policies and procedures and how to write effective ones; e.g., the elements of effective financial policies and procedures.

2.	Provide NPCs with specific examples of policies and procedures needed for financial reporting to the board of directors, comparative financial statements, budgeting, accrual accounting, revenue accounting, expense accounting, and internal controls.

3.	Provide NPCs with examples of financial policies and procedures specific to staff size: NPCs with 1-2 administrative staff members and low revenues; those with 2-4 staff members and mid-range revenues; and those with large staffs (4 or more) and high revenues; targeting just two groups rather than three will be a possibility.

4.	Provide an overview of federal and non-federal medical research grants and contracts, as well as, sub-awards and subcontracts.  Provide examples of financial statements regarding these varied funding mechanisms. 

5.	Provide sample policies and procedures that meet standards applicable to nonprofits that administer federal awards and contracts such as 2 CFR 215. 

6.	Incorporate practical guidance on policies and procedures consistent with COSO that provide good internal controls and practical guidance on policies and procedures consistent with the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) publication "Managing the Business Risk of Fraud; A Practical Guide" to guard against fraud. 

7.	Develop a Training Manual and related Microsoft PowerPoint presentation and handouts for use within VA and its affiliated NPCs.  These materials will be delivered to the VA for unrestricted use by VA NPCs and any other organization the VA deems necessary without any further compensation due to the contractor. 

8.	Provide useful checklists, forms, etc. to facilitate prompt application of the workshop content to NPC activities and financial management.  This training is being provided as one of the responses to VAOIG-07-00564-121 "Audit of Veterans Health Administration's Oversight of Nonprofit Research and Education Corporations."  Findings are detailed later in this Statement of Work.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Addendum</p>
<p>Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered. <br />a. If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />b. For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR). <br />a. All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />b. Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />c. Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC). <br />a. The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />b. To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/http://www.ccr2000.com/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />c. Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />d. Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />e. The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />f. Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</p>
<p>4. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM). <br />a. In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM. <br />b. A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. <br />c. The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />d. The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />e. The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users. <br />f. The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.</p>
<p>5. Establish an organizational email address<br />a. All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account. <br />b. The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />c. Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />d. Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />a. Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />b. Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>
<p>7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br />a. Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br />b. Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />c. Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br />d. PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />e. If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br />f. Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>
<p>8. Follow-up (if necessary).<br />If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:</p>

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.</p>
<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

 STATEMENT OF WORK

VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (VHA)
Workshop on Financial Policies and Procedures for VA affiliated 
Nonprofit Research and Education Corporations (NPCs)


Project description/scope of work:
 
VHA is seeking to conduct comprehensive workshop on financial policies and procedures to ensure sound financial management and effective internal controls among the 84 VA-affiliated nonprofit research and education corporations (NPCs).  In 1988, Congress authorized VA medical centers to establish NPCs to administer non-VA federal and private sector funds provided in support of research and education performed at VA medical centers.  

The May 5, 2008, OIG report on five NPCs and on VHA oversight of the NPCs contained the following findings:  "NPCs did not have adequate controls to manage funds" and "NPCs did not adequately segregate financial duties."  The workshop described in this statement of work will increase NPC awareness of the OIG findings and will provide tools to improve NPC financial management.  Offering this training will also fulfill one component of VHA's commitment to improve NPC oversight.

The target audience is the NPC management team (i.e., executive director and senior financial personnel) and the Board Treasurer of the VA NPCs.  This will be an invitation only event for a limited number of the target audience.  Expected attendance will be 99 people.

The program will provide a minimum of 10 hours of training for attendees.

The goal of the training is to:

1.	Provide an overview on rationale for written financial policies and procedures and how to write effective ones; e.g., the elements of effective financial policies and procedures.

2.	Provide NPCs with specific examples of policies and procedures needed for financial reporting to the board of directors, comparative financial statements, budgeting, accrual accounting, revenue accounting, expense accounting, and internal controls.

3.	Provide NPCs with examples of financial policies and procedures specific to staff size: NPCs with 1-2 administrative staff members and low revenues; those with 2-4 staff members and mid-range revenues; and those with large staffs (4 or more) and high revenues; targeting just two groups rather than three will be a possibility.

4.	Provide an overview of federal and non-federal medical research grants and contracts, as well as, sub-awards and subcontracts.  Provide examples of financial statements regarding these varied funding mechanisms. 

5.	Provide sample policies and procedures that meet standards applicable to nonprofits that administer federal awards and contracts such as 2 CFR 215. 

6.	Incorporate practical guidance on policies and procedures consistent with COSO that provide good internal controls and practical guidance on policies and procedures consistent with the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) publication "Managing the Business Risk of Fraud; A Practical Guide" to guard against fraud. 

7.	Develop a Training Manual and related Microsoft PowerPoint presentation and handouts for use within VA and its affiliated NPCs.  These materials will be delivered to the VA for unrestricted use by VA NPCs and any other organization the VA deems necessary without any further compensation due to the contractor. 

8.	Provide useful checklists, forms, etc. to facilitate prompt application of the workshop content to NPC activities and financial management.  This training is being provided as one of the responses to VAOIG-07-00564-121 "Audit of Veterans Health Administration's Oversight of Nonprofit Research and Education Corporations."  Findings are detailed later in this Statement of Work.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this modification is to: (1) Incorporate additional information for the following two focus areas for FY11: Determine Adversary Opportunities and Identify Adversary Intent; (2) Changing the FY11 recommended dates for white papers for these two topic areas.</p>
<p>(1) Insert the following two topic areas under I. Funding Opportunity Description, Section 3.0 Anticipation:</p>
<p>3.3 Determine Adversary Opportunities</p>
<p>The intent is to seek new and innovative ideas for experimental and theoretical development of technologies to fill DOD requirements for determining adversary opportunities. The focus is on applied research and advanced technology development objectives for understanding adversarial opportunities to fit within the existing Situation Identification and Threat Assessment (SITA) framework. Given opportunities exists based on "our" vulnerabilities, this research focuses on the development of algorithms that will automatically identify the opportunities that an adversary might have in accomplishing their intent or goals. Focus should initially be on the cyber domain, but should be extensible to additional domains (cross domain) such as air, and space.</p>
<p>3.4 Identify Adversary Intent</p>
<p>The intent is to seek new and innovative ideas for experimental and theoretical development of technologies to fill DOD requirements to identify adversary intent. The focus is on applied research and advanced technology development objectives for identification of adversary intent to fit within the existing Situation Identification and Threat Assessment (SITA) framework. Current research will apply innovative techniques that will identify adversarial intent or goals. Focus should initially be on the cyber domain, but should be extensible to additional domains (cross domain) such as air, and space.</p>
<p>(2) The recommended date for submittal of FY 11 white papers for the two topic areas above is 17 June 2010.</p>
<p>All other information remains the same.</p>

<DESC>Information is being collected for market research purposes and not as a request for proposal or as an obligation on part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research and will not pay for information solicited but is interested in worldwide sources.  The purpose of this notification is to identify parties that may have interest and capability to respond to and comply with the Armys future logistics requirements as part of the emerging Enhanced Army Global Logistics Enterprise (EAGLE) Program.  All information submitted will be retained in the contract office files as market research and will be used for Government purposes only.<BR><BR>The Army Sustainment Command (ASC), Rock Island, IL, in conjunction with the Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) and other Army Commands, is leading a comprehensive acquisition to fulfill the Army's future logistics requirements to obtain contract services to support global missions that ensure success of the Army imperatives to sustain the Armys soldiers, families and civilians, to prepare forces for victory in current conflicts, to reset forces to rebuild readiness for future deployments and contingencies, and to transform forces to meet the demands of a persistent conflict in the 21st Century.  Contract services are contemplated for both CONUS and OCONUS operating environments.     The Rock Island Contracting Center (RICC) of the Army Contracting Command (ACC) currently provides cradle to grave contracting support for ASC requirements and is issuing this notification on their behalf.   In addition, the Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) is supporting the contracting efforts of this acquisition.<BR><BR>Previous fulfillment of these requirements has been accomplished through a variety of strategies using both contracts and Government resources.  The contracts have been primarily executed through the RICC and MICC via the Army's Field and Installation Readiness Support Team (FIRST) contract as well as independent contracts executed by local and regional contracting centers.  The contracts have been awarded to both large and small businesses. <BR><BR>The Armys future logistics acquisition is contemplated to be executed as Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs). The contemplated ordering period for the basic contract efforts consists of a two-year base with eight potential Award Term years, utilizing Award Term provisions.  The Government anticipates using an On-Ramp/Off-Ramp approach to allow for the entrance and exit of contractors to ensure sufficient capability exists to continuously support requirements.  Task Orders may include Cost-Plus, Fixed-Price or Time and Material with a multitude of incentive arrangements, including award fee, incentive fee, and fixed fee.<BR><BR>The EAGLE Program has changed from 14 Tasks Areas, noted in the 9 February 2010 Sources Sought notice, to the following 4 Functional Areas (Supply, Maintenance, Transportation Support, Plans & Ops).  The sub-function areas noted below are provided as examples and may not be all inclusive.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), to negotiate/award a purchase order to the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) to perform research on the  project entitled Predictors of Smoking in Mexican American Youth.


The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center will collect social network data within the research project entitled Predictors of Smoking in Mexican American Youth.  The current project aims to 1) determine the prevalence of experimentation with cigarettes and alcohol and assess sensation-seeking tendencies, acculturation levels and social network structures in N=1500 unrelated adolescents aged 14 to 17 years at enrollment by completing an in-home interview; 2) assess participants progression from experimentation with tobacco smoking, and alcohol to regular use, and dependence; 3) evaluate how variations in candidate genes, including those related to nicotine and alcohol metabolism, dopamine, serotonin, cannabinoid, opioid receptors and transporters, and genes encoding enzymes involved in synthesis or metabolism of neurotransmitters may influence the initiation, establishment and dependence upon the substances following experimentation; and 4) develop quantitative multivariate risk assessment models for experimentation, initiation and dependence in order to identify high-risk adolescent subgroups. 

The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center will provide the following support on the project:  
Administer the baseline and follow-up assessment surveys to study participants.  
Prepare a dataset for analysis.
. 
The sample for this project is part of an ongoing research protocol.  MDACC has maintained contact with study participants over the past 4 years and has developed a rapport with the families and communities who have participated in the project.  Additionally the Principal Investigator on the study, has a significant understanding of the studys objectives and provides access to study participants.  It would be disruptive to the study for a different project team to conduct the interviews.

 This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690 and the Size Standard is $7.0 Million. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>This is a follow up synopsis to previously posted SOURCES SOUGHT N00421-10-NR-55021. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) PMA-273 NAVAL UNDERGRADUATE FLIGHT TRAINING SYSTEMS, Patuxent River, MD has a requirement for tasking and equipment required for Organization, Intermediate, and possibly Depot-level aircraft maintenance and logistics support for the USN T-34, T-44 and T-6 trainer aircraft programs. This support is currently being performed under Contract N00019-06-D-0017 awarded to Sikorsky Support Services, Inc (SSSI). In addition, Contract N00019-10-C-0051 was awarded to L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace, LLC to primarily assist SSSI with on-site scheduled maintenance for both T-34 and T-44 to recover Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) FY10 Pilot Throughput Rate (PTR). The NAVAIR Freedom of Information Action (FOIA) website is available at http://foia.navair.navy.mil.
<p>There are approximately two hundred and seventy-three (273) T-34 aircraft. The T-34 is a single engine, two-place (tandem seat), unpressurized, low-wing, monoplane manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company. The T-34 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Pensacola (NASP), FL, Naval Air Station Whiting Field (NASWF), FL, and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC), TX. The T-34 aircraft are also assigned to assorted satellite sites to be used for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) projects, range clearance and coordination, tactical strike observations, pilot proficiency, and as competitive exercise observer platforms at the following satellite sights: NAS Lemoore, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; NAS Oceana, VA; NAF El Centro, CA; ATTC Fort Rucker, AL; Redstone Army Airfield, Huntsville, AL; NAWCAD Patuxent River, MD; Pope AFB Fayetteville, NC; NASA Cleveland, OH; NASA Edwards AFB, CA; and Fort Eustis, VA.</p>
<p>There are approximately fifty-four (54) T-44 aircraft. The T-44A and T-44C aircraft are twin-engine, pressurized, fixed-wing, five-place monoplanes manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company. The T-44A and T-44C aircraft are identical in airframe and propulsion, but the T-44C avionics have been upgraded to an integrated digital cockpit. The T-44 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC).</p>
<p>There are approximately forty-two (42) T-6A aircraft and twenty (20) T-6B aircraft. The T-6A/B aircraft are single-engine, two-place (tandem seat), pressurized, low-wing, monoplanes manufactured by Hawker Beechcraft Corporation. Both aircraft are powered by a PT6A-68 free turbine turboprop engine, flat rated at 1100 shp, manufactured by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. Each aircraft is equipped with two Martin-Baker US16LA ejection seats and On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS). The T-6 is the replacement aircraft for the T-34C. The T-6 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Pensacola (NASP), Naval Air Station Whiting Field (NASWF) and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC). The T-6 aircraft are also assigned to satellite sites (noted above for T-34), to be used for RDT&amp;E, production integration testing, range clearance and coordination, tactical strike observations, pilot proficiency, and competitive exercise observer platforms.</p>
<p>THE USN NO LONGER INTENDS TO USE SEAPORT-E TO SOLICIT OFFERS FOR THIS EFFORT AND NOW INTENDS TO USE FULL &amp; OPEN COMPETITIVE PROCEDURES VIA FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES USING SOLICITATION NUMBER N00019-10-R-0069. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME. SOLICITATION RELEASE IS ANTICIPATED TO BE IN SEPTEMBER WITH INDUSTRY SITE VISITS TO VIEW THE MATERIAL CONDITION OF AIRCRAFT AFTER SOLICITATION RELEASE. FULL PERFORMANCE IS ANTICIPATED TO COMMENCE BY 1 APRIL 2011. Please continue to monitor this website, as well as the NAVAIR open solicitation website at the following URL http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/index.cfm for updated information as it becomes available.</p>
<p>Attached hereto is a DRAFT version of the Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS) and DRAFT associated documents for industry's review and feedback. The Government has incorporated comments provided during previous PMA 273 industry days and one-on-one sessions, and is receptive to additional ideas to further reduce or limit constraining requirements, approaches to reduce risks, and highlight potential safety, quality, technical or contractual problem areas. While the DRAFT PWS is not a DRAFT Solicitation, comments and recommendations pertaining to any part of the upcoming solicitation, including Sections L and M, as well as general comments on a best value basis for award are welcomed, including any concerns, questions, refinements, or suggestions. Comments on instructions for preparing and presenting proposal volumes on cost, past performance and other subjects are also welcomed. The Government expects to use a best value basis for award, and the Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) reflects areas of interest and concern to the Government. The PMF represents a more focused means of measuring Contractor performance, and measures alignment with the Navy's objectives of Safety, Quality, Sustainment, Performance and ultimately PTR. The Government is seeking input with respect to the notional incentive arrangement itself, and how best to incentivize meeting PTR, which is a critical component of CNATRA's mission.&nbsp; The Government solicits comments, recommendations, and questions that might further align and clarify the understanding between the Government and potential offerors, including whether the PMF is understandable and executable.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the upcoming requirement is intended to include at least a base year with one (1) or two (2) one-year options. The final selection of contract types and the scope of work within each type have not been determined at this time. Fixed price elements are likely to be associated with Total Lifecycle Product Support (TLPS), other than conditional maintenance. Cost reimbursement elements are likely to be associated with conditional maintenance and the parts and consumables. The Government expects to project expenditures for the parts and consumable cost reimbursement elements, based on past experience in the procurement of parts and consumables supporting the PWS.

<DESC><p>GC09-1, NC GENERAL CONSTRUCTION MATOC<br /><br />Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), for Design/Build or Construction type task orders. Task orders issued under this MATOC are anticipated to require performance of work predominantly in North Carolina. However, this does not preclude issuance of task orders which may require performance of work at other military locations, so long as these sites are located within the South Atlantic Division Area of Operations (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi). A project requiring use of civil funds or otherwise termed as civil construction is not authorized under this contract.<br /><br />This acquisition is being offered for unrestricted competition. The life of the basic contract is for a base period of three (3) years with two (2) one-year option periods or $499M; whichever occurs first. The pool size (number of contracts that may be awarded) shall not exceed six (6) contractors. The pool of contractors which successfully receive an award will share the total contract capacity of $499M. The Government will use a best value Performance Price Trade-off (PPT) evaluation process in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.101-1. The order limitation of task orders, to include the seed task order that will be used for evaluation purposes and award of the initial contracts, shall range between $5M and $100M. Task orders issued under this MATOC will be firm-fixed price. The initial seed task order may include options. <br /><br />Description of work: Task orders placed under this MATOC may be either of a design-build nature or that of a design-bid-build (construction only) nature. Work may include, but is not limited to, repairs, renovations, alterations, and/or additions to existing buildings such as administrative, recreational, educational, religious, medical, and training type facilities as well as their corresponding support facilities, or infrastructure such as roads, parking, drainage systems, utility systems, and force protection. Work under this MATOC may also include the design and the construction of various types of facilities including but not limited to, administrative, recreational, educational, religious, medical, and training type as well as their corresponding support facilities. Generally, however, task orders anticipated to be issued under this MATOC will be primarily for new, vertical construction and associated site work. <br /><br />The scope of the seed task order, which will be the first task order awarded, involves the construction of a new Intermediate School (IS) to serve 725 students, grades 5 and 6. The school will be reinforced concrete and/or steel framing and will include general-purpose classrooms, art classroom, music classroom, computer labs, gymnasium, multipurpose room with stage and kitchen, specialists rooms, information center, administrative offices, teacher workrooms, and supply/storage rooms. The school will incorporate advanced communication systems to support technology program requirements, as well as general communications. The project scope will also include utilities, parking, bus loading/unloading area, playground, sports facilities, signage, fencing, landscaping, and security lighting. Handicapped access will be provided. Options may also be included in the seed task order. <br /><br />Evaluation Criteria: As this is a solicitation for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), a seed task order will be provided for purposes of evaluation and in rendering the best value decision. Only that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value of those offerors selected to be in the MATOC pool, if any, will also be awarded the seed task order. All other successful offerors, if any, will be awarded a contract with a minimum guarantee of $2,500. The evaluation factors and their relative importance of this solicitation and evaluation process are as follows: <br /><br />Factor 1 CORPORATE RELEVANT SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE, Factor 2 PAST PERFORMANCE, and Factor 3 TECHNICAL APPROACH NARRATIVE. Factor 4 PROPOSED CONTRACT DURATION AND SUMMARY SCHEDULE. <br />Factor 1 is more important than factors 2 and 3 and significantly more important than factor 4. Factor 2 is equal in importance to Factor 3 and more important than Factor 4. Factor 3 is equal in importance to Factor 2 and more important than Factor 4. <br /><br />Price: All non-cost factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.<br /><br />Award will be made to those Offerors whose technical submittal and price proposal contain the combination of the criteria requested that offers the best value to the Government. Proposals shall include sufficient detailed information to allow complete evaluation. The Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of acceptability rests with the Offeror.<br /><br />This solicitation will be issued in electronic format only.

The project consists of the re-grading and resurfacing of approximately 18,800 SY of parking lots and sur-rounding paved areas at Building 2521.  Associated storm drainage ditches and structures are also included in the project.  
Demolition on the site is minimal and shall include, but is not limited to:  cold milling of existing asphalt areas within the fence line, removal of the security fence on the eastern and north western sides of the building and the gravel pavement within the fenced area.  The existing gravel parking lot outside of the security fence will have approximately 5" of gravel removed to allow for this area to receive asphalt pavement.  On the eastern and northern sides of the site, 5-15" corrugated metal pipes will be removed.Primary approach to Building 2521 is from Highway 331.  A Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) parking area is required for this improvement project.  This project also requires concrete motorcycle parking which will be located between Buildings 2521 and 3422.  Approximately 300 linear feet of chain-link fencing will be installed.Within the existing fence line, gravel areas will be re-compacted and receive a 3-inch base course with a 2-inch asphalt surface course.  Per user request, grassed areas were added on the southern and eastern sides of the site.  However, to allow for delivery trucks to have access to doors 8 and 13, 100-foot wide paved turnaround areas were added in front of these doors.  Existing paved areas will receive a minimum of 2-inches of asphalt surface course.  At the location of the existing train tracks, a full-depth asphalt pavement will be constructed.Outside of the existing fence line, a minimum of 2-inches of asphalt surface course and new pavement markings will be applied to the existing asphalt POV parking lots.  The existing gravel POV lot will receive a 3-inch base course with a 2-inch asphalt surface course.All paved areas shall have a minimum slope of 1%.
The storm drainage system shall be designed to handle a 10-year, 24-hour storm.  Site storm water runoff will be collected in surface ditches and catch basins and be directed away from the building and parking areas.  On the eastern side of the site, a proposed catch basin and 18" RCP will tie into an existing manhole.  On the south side of the site, two proposed catch basins and 18" outlet pipes will be installed to improve the current site drainage.THIS FIRM FIXED PRICED TASK ORDER IS BASED ON PREPRICED LINE ITEMS THAT WERE OBTAINED THROUGH COMPETITION AT THE TIME OF THE BASIC CONTRACT AWARD.

<DESC>Contract modification was awarded on June 1, 2010

RECOVERYTHIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.   THIS NOTICE IS NOT A NOTICE FOR SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.  THE ACTION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT, DOLJ07UA00016.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR IDENTIFIED BELOW.

This opportunity was available only to DEL-JEN, Inc. under contract number DOLJ07UA00016. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps has awarded a modification in the amount of $300,000 to the Gainesville Job Corps Center, operated by DEL-JEN, Inc.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceilings for this contract.

It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost-Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).

The funding is intended to address the Renewable Energy Program and Equipment initiative to support additional career technical training opportunities to the students of Gainesville Job Corps Center.  The operator of the Gainesville Job Corps Center will not procure the services through subcontracting opportunities.

<DESC>Each pipe manufacturer typically has a different method of connecting pipes together, which means that one brand of pipe will not connect to a different brand of pipe without the use of special fittings or adaptors. Because this office currently has approximately 100,000 total feet of ADS N-12 pipe installed in our various dredge material disposal areas, it is important that future pipe purchases be of the same type of pipe in order to keep the pipes interchangeable. In this way, if a single pipe is damaged during dredging operation, that pipe can be dug up and replaced by a new pipe. If a different brand of pipe was used to repair the damage the entire pipe run (up to as many as ten connected pipes) would have to be dug up and replaced with the new brand of pipe because the new pipe would not be able to be connected to the undamaged pipes, resulting in considerable extra expense to the Government. ADS pipe has been used in our application for the past ten years and has meet and exceeded our expectation for ease or use, functionality, and durability. This request is for Advanced Drainage Systems (ADS) HDPE corrugated gravity drainage pipe, specifically N-12 ST IB Soil-tight pipe with 36' inside diameter. In total 54, 20Ft. sections (1080 ft) are needed. ADS N-12 ST IB Mega Green which is comprised of 40% recycled high density polyethylene is also acceptable in the event there is no pricing discrepancy with regard to the standard HDPE blended pipe. Product should include appropriate quantities of joint/gasket lubricant and be deliverable to USACE open storage yard located at the corner of Business 98 and 2nd Street in Springfield Florida.

<AWDNBR>NSFDACS10P1315
<DESC><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR <br />OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>1. Agency, Contracting Activity and Document</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF), Office of Polar Programs (OPP), Arctic Science Division proposes a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) for acquisition of RADARSAT-1 images of ice conditions in the Bering Sea in support of the RV Thompson, a vessel under charter through UNOLS to support NSF funded research in the Bering Sea.</p>
<p>2. Action Being Approved</p>
<p>The action to be approved is the solicitation and award of a contract to MDA Geospatial Services, 13800 Commerce Parkway, Richmond, BC, V6V213, Canada, to provide satellite images with attendant programming priority requirements and processing in near-real-time.</p>
<p>3. Description of Services</p>
<p>The vendor will provide separate images over the period 5/24 thru 5/30, using the RADARSAT-1 Satellite. Images will cover many latitude/longitude areas to provide ice condition information in the Bering Sea. This order is necessary to follow the scheduled track of the vessel, ensuring that the science party is able to visit the maximum number of locations for sampling and observations. The total not-to-exceed estimated price is $59,656.00.</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-2; Unusual and Compelling Urgency. In addition, FAR6.302-1, since MDA Geospatial Services is the only known source able to satisfy this need. The NSF was not aware that these images would be required until the vessel arrived in the Bering Sea, observed the unusual sea ice conditions, and requested immediate additional support to find and pursue navigable routes.</p>
<p>5. Contractor's Unique Qualifications</p>
<p>The government of Canada controls the operation of RADARSAT-1 and has authorized MDA Geospacial Services to sell commercial images.</p>
<p>6. Efforts Made to Obtain Competition</p>
<p>NSF Program Managers in OPP/Arctic Sciences Division are experts in providing ship support in the Arctic arena. They are continually aware of developments in the satellite industry and have confirmed that no alternate imaging or source is available. This was further confirmed by the Chief Scientist, U.S. National/Naval Ice Center, NOAA Satellite Operations Facility.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will perform cost and price analysis to determine that the proposed prices are fair and reasonable. Prices offered are consistent with those charged other U.S. Government Agencies, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p>8. Market Survey</p>
<p>Based on the efforts described under item 6 above, no additional market survey was undertaken.</p>
<p>9. Additional Information <br />None<br />10. Other Sources Expressing an Interest</p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p>11. Removing Barriers to Competition</p>
<p>There are currently no known plans for any U.S. agency to launch and operate a satellite that would provide this coverage. NSF will continue to monitor developments within the industry and utilize any developed competition as appropriate in the future. <br />12. Certifications/Coordinations/Approval</p>
<p>REQUESTING OFFICE CERTIFICATION<br />Program Officer (OD/OPP): I hereby certify that the facts presented in this Justification are current, complete and accurate.</p>
<p>__________________________________<br />Name - Patrick R. Haggerty Date - 6/01/10</p>
<p>PROCURING OFFICE CERTIFICATION<br />Contracting Officer: I assure that a detailed analysis will be performed on all proposed prices to assure that they are fair and reasonable. I also certify that this Justification is current, complete and accurate.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-1,   41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)

1.	The Department of Veterans Affairs Network 22 Logistics Office, 5901 East Seventh Street, Long Beach, California, as directed by the VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California, intents to enter into a contract that will require justification for other than full and open competition. 

2.	The request is being procured exclusive of competition, from a specific vendor.

3.	VA San Diego Healthcare System (Director (00) is requesting sole source procurement with San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina to provide Hotel Rooms, Food & Beverage, Parking and Meeting Rooms at an estimated total cost of $360,000.00 for a base plus two(2) -one year additional option years.

4.	The service being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR Part 6.302-1(2).  This authority applies when supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.303.  

5.	The San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina at the San Diego Harbor is being requested on a sole source basis to host the new Summer Sports Clinic for the period September 15 through September 25, 2010 with the Government's option to extend two additional one year option years.  This includes a new pilot physical and recreational therapy clinic and is geared toward the recently injured combat veterans (OIF/OEF) including those with TBI, PTSD, amputees and wheelchair veterans.  The main activity for this event is sailing the depth of the water there as well as the proximity and accessibility to the docks and sailing slips from the Marriott hotel is perfect.  Participants who shall be attending this inaugural event shall be dealing with multiple disabilities and mobility issues.  The ability to walk right outside the hotel to slips and launch areas provides for a safe and secure environment.  Due to accessibility concerns this event shall require the cooperation of various dock/slip providers.  Numerous adaptations shall be required to facilitate the ease of use of this area.  The Dock Master who is a paid Marriott employee shall be instrumental in dealing with private slip owners/renters and use.  He not only has the necessary credentials, he also has the authority to make important and necessary decisions regarding our use and success.  Among many two major concerns are vital: first for safety concerns, we will need to dock our boats right off the walkway from the hotel.  The Dock Master shall ensure that we will have use of the first 7 slips, second we shall require special construction and modification to the dock for the installation of wheelchair lifts at no cost to the Government, if construction is required cost shall be at the hotel's expense.  The Dock Master shall also ensure this special need is met.  This type of cooperation is not available with the other hotel in the area and is critical.  Beside the excellent location to the dock/slip we also have ideal access to the public parks directly across from the hotel.  These parks shall serve as activity venues and shall be easy to access and navigate by the participants.  This vendor is being utilized without competition at this time due to the fact that they are the only hotel that has accessibility to the docks and is in close proximity where the events are going to be held at.  It is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to enter into a contract with this vendor.  

6.	A FEDBIZOPPS Notice of intent to make award absent competition has been drafted and will be published following approval of this procurement method.   

7.	The anticipated cost is fair and reasonable to the Government based on the using service estimate.

8.	These services are only available directly from the Contractor.

9.	Full and open competition was not utilized for this procurement due to the reasons stated in paragraph 4 and 5 above.  The San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina has been determined to be the sole source provider.  

10.	No other sources as stated in line #5 & 8 above.

11.	Not applicable per line #2 and 4 above.

12.	I hereby certify, as the Contracting Officer, that the above justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
