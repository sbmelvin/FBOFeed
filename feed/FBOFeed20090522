<DESC><p>RECOVERY - The Energy Research Group of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), in collaboration with the Technical Directorate of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the design, fabrication, and demonstration of a bioreactor that utilizes a municipal waste stream of degradable organic waste within a high solids inflow to generate energy and reduce the volume of material deposited in a landfill from an Air Force installation.
<p>The Air Force is interested in demonstrating how biogas from anaerobic digestion of organic waste can be used to offset bioreactor operating expenses or enhance aerobic decomposition of waste for the following purposes: 1) provide economical and sustainable power to an electricity grid to reduce Air Force installation energy costs; 2) produce a marketable by-product if practicable (e.g. compost); and 3) significantly reduce the volume of waste deposited to landfills. A crucial element of the research and development approach will be to fabricate and demonstrate a scaled bioreactor that will handle a feedstock comprised of greater than 20 percent solids. Influent municipal waste solids would include glass, metal, plastic and other inorganic constituents. Additional organic influent such as wood, paper, grass, and sewage sludge could be utilized to determine an optimal influent composition and treatment regime to reach the stated goals and an acceptable return on investment.</p>
<p>Anticipated total program funding is $5.832M with multiple awards possible.</p>

To meet the requirement for Core workload, the Air Logistics Centers (ALC) will enter into a partnering agreement with BAE Systems for Engineering and Technical Services in support of WRALC and OCALC depot repair capabilities and potential AF future repair of applicable LRU's and SRU's identified as Core.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The partnering agreement will facilitate the transition of some of the day to day operations for touch labor provided by the ALC and be in place to coincide with the repair certification process for depot repair.

<DESC><p>This synopsis is a presolicitaion notice and is not a request for proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS) mission is to ensure health care security to all beneficiaries. In carrying out this mission, CMS is dedicated to the highest integrity of its programs and has contracted with various entities for benefit integrity functions. Originally, program integrity efforts were aligned with CMS' fiscal intermediaries and carriers. The recent enactment of section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) changes CMS' current contracting structure by phasing out the fiscal intermediaries and carriers and phasing in the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) for CMS Medicare claims processing. As a result of the MMA and the adoption of the MAC strategy, a realignment of the program integrity jurisdictions is necessary so that workloads align with the new MACs. In addition, the future intent of these realignments is to have one program integrity contractor be responsible for the detection, deterrence and prevention of fraud, waste, and abuse across all claim types.
<p>CMS has established seven (7) jurisdictional zones to deal efficiently with fraud, waste and abuse issues which also align effectively with multiple MAC jurisdictions. CMS will be procuring the seven (7) zones in three (3) separate cycles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for two (2) zones as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;ZPIC Cycle Three</p>
<p>Zone 3: Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky</p>
<p>Zone 6: Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, DC, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Vermont</p>
<p>It is anticipated that two (2) separate stand alone single IDIQ contracts will be awarded, one for each zone, with a base period plus 4 option years. CMS intends to solicit this requirement as a full and open competition. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of Request for Proposal in June, 2009. The solicitation will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is estimated&nbsp;that this cycle will be awarded before December 31, 2009.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) intends to increase the total maximum limitation of GSA Contract Number GS00T00NSD0004 from $65.173 million to $145.108 million as a result of a greater level of support efforts required by GSA Federal Technology Services and its customer agencies than originally anticipated.  However, if the results of this market survey indicate there are at least 2 or more potential qualified sources who can support this proposed increased requirement, the Government will consider release of a competitive requirement.  This is a sole source cost-plus-fixed-fee contract that was awarded under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253C(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to Mitretek Systems, Incorporate, Center for Telecommunications and Advanced Technology, 3150 Fairview Park Road South, Falls Church, Virginia, a non-profit, conflict-free organization, for telecommunications advisory and assistance services.  The base contract period of performance is for one year with four option years.  The contract, awarded January 1, 2000, is currently in its third year of operation.  Under this contract, Mitretek currently provides continuous support to GSA and its customer agencies in the definition, analysis, acquisition, evolution, and independent and objective evaluation of telecommunications services and systems in support of GSA's current FTS2001, Metropolitan Area Acquisition (MAA), associated niche contract programs, the successor inter/intracity telecommunications acquisition environment, and the development of overall Federal Government telecommunications services strategic concepts, and their interfaces with other GSA and Federal Government telecommunications efforts.  The nature of the work being performed requires freedom from actual or potential conflict of interest (no direct or indirect association with firms in the telecommunications industry), knowledge in the field of telecommunications and in government/GSA telecommunications services and systems, no engagement in any business activity which could make the Contractor appear unsuitable for having access to GSA's or other government entities' plans, standards, methodologies, acquisition information, and vendor proprietary information.  This requirement has been limited to those functions that require the services of a non-profit, conflict-free organization that possesses unique telecommunications capabilities.  This contract includes a requirement that the Contractor shall be prohibited from participating in competition as a prime, subcontractor, or consultant for the Government of any items and/or services to be furnished and other contracts based on any work performed under this contract.  The term "Contractor" includes Contractor personnel, subcontractors, and consultants.  All Contractor personnel shall be considered procurement officials and will be subject to the provisions of Section 27 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41.U.S.C.423).  Interested Contractors are invited to identify their interest and technical capability to respond to the requirement within 15 days following the date of publication of this notice.  Brochures alone are not sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities, conflict free credentials, and unbiased status.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Send written responses to Elaine Bryant, GSA, Contract Management and Administration Branch, TQN, 10304 Eaton Place, Fairfax, VA  22030-2213.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.*****

<DESC>The project consists of developing three novel flow cytometric reagents for detecting pathogenic bacterial agents in food. The targeted agents are Campylobacter spp.; Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio spp. 

This procurement will be open to all sources. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541711-Research and Development in Biotechnology and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. The period of performance is 365 calendar days after notice of award for product development. The IDIQ portion period of performance will be 365 calendar days after successful product development. The resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price type. The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about June 5, 2009. 

The solicitation will be available for download on FedBizOpps website when the RFP is issued.

Scope of Work

Independently and not as an agent of the government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things necessary for or incident to the performance of the work set forth herein. The contractor shall develop three novel flow cytyometric reagents for detecting pathogenic bacterial agents in food. The targeted agents are Campylobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio spp. These reagents must fluoresce under 488 nm excitation and produce a strong signal in a typical cytometric FL1 channel (525nm) but not significantly in FL2 or FL3 regions. The finished product shall also include additional modifiers that eliminate or significantly reduce assay-confounding auto-fluorescence from the food particles.

The finished product of each reagent that can cytometrically detect and count each of the three target pathogens while meeting relevant inclusivity, exclusivity, competitive, linearity, and quantitative detection limit criteria, as well as the capacity to exclude food matrix signal interference for food products with which each target pathogen is commonly associated (e.g. - Campylobacter in pork, Vibrio in seafood, Staphylococcus in raw milk). 

Acceptable detection of a single CFU can be achieved by a four hour culture in TSB under agent-optimal incubation conditions from a 100 level inoculation followed by 5 uM filtration or other minimal sample preparation, <15 minute incubation followed by flow cytometric detection in 250 &#61549;L of the TSB.

Linear dynamic range should be 4 logs or greater.

The "Competitive" criterion means that the target organism is correctly detected and counted in up to a 106 excess of a typical non-pathogenic bacterial food contaminant.

Inclusivity and exclusivity specifications vary with each agent but mean: 
•	for inclusivity, successful detection of those pathogenic species and strains of each target that are typically found in the US human food supply.
•	for exclusivity, lack of signal from non-target bacterial organisms commonly found in the same foods as the target. 

Schedule of Items

Item No.		Description						

01-		Development of Campylobacter spp. reagent as specified.			

02-		Development of Vibrio spp. reagent as specified.

				
03-	                    Development of Staphylococcus aureus  reagent as specified.
                                         This is a level of effort term item in accordance with FAR 16.207. 
			

After successful product development there will be an IDIQ portion to the contract. The government will require delivery for the reagents to multiple locations, on multiple dates over a one year period.  

IDIQ 01		Campylobacter spp.  reagent as specified. Minimum quantity 750		

IDIQ 02		Vibrio spp. reagent as specified. Minimum quantity 600		

IDIQ 03		Staphylococcus aureus reagent as specified. Minimum quantity 600
							

The solicitation will be awarded based on best value (FAR 15.101-1); therefore, proposals will be evaluated on technical merit, cost effectiveness and past performance. Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 15.3.

a.	Product sample to demonstrate successful product development. This shall be accomplished by one of two methods. ---weight 40%
(1) by providing a workable sample of each product development reagent that can cytometrically detect and count each of the three target pathogens while meeting relevant inclusivity, exclusivity, competitive, linearity, and quantitative detection limit criteria, as well as the capacity to exclude food matrix signal interference for food products with which each target pathogen is commonly associated (e.g. - Campylobacter in pork, Vibrio in seafood, Staphylococcus in raw milk); or 
(2) show the technical capability to develop such products, by providing a workable reagent that can cytometrically detect within four hours one cell of a typical food-borne gram negative or gram positive bacterium in two of the following food matrices.
1. a leafy green vegetable. 
2. hamburger
3. peanut butter
4. chili peppers.

b.	Demonstrate ability and understanding of the Scope of Work.---Weight 30%

The GTEx project objective is to provide the scientific community a resource with which to study human gene expression and regulation and its relationship to genetic variation. This project will collect and analyze multiple human tissues from donors who are also densely genotyped, to assess genetic variation within their genomes. By analyzing global RNA expression within individual tissues and treating the expression levels of genes as quantitative traits, variations in gene expression that are highly correlated with genetic variation can be identified as expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs. 

Despite the rapid progress achieved using genome-wide association studies to identify genetic changes associated with common human diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, asthma, and stroke, a large majority of these genetic changes lies outside of the protein-coding regions of genes and often even outside of the genes themselves, making it difficult to discern which genes are affected and by what mechanism. The comprehensive identification of human eQTLs will greatly help to identify genes whose expression is affected by genetic variation and will provide a valuable basis on which to study the mechanism of that gene regulation.

The GTEx project is a 2.5 year pilot with the primary goal of testing the feasibility of collecting high-quality RNA and DNA from multiple tissues from approximately 160 donors identified through low post-mortem interval autopsy or organ transplant settings. For a small subset of tissues, collection from living surgery patients will also be performed to compare to the autopsy-derived tissues. If the pilot phase proves successful, the project will be scaled up to involve approximately 1,000 donors. 

The project will also involve consultation and research into the ethical, legal and social issues raised by the research, support for statistical methods development, and creation of a database to house existing and GTEx-generated eQTL data. The database will allow users to view and download computed eQTL results and to provide a controlled access system for de-identified individual-level genotype, expression, and clinical data. The associated tissue repository will also serve as a resource for many additional kinds of analyses.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS; See: http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies) have shown great promise in identifying genetic loci associated with common human diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.  Despite this progress, the majority of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other genetic changes significantly associated with phenotype, lie outside of the protein-coding regions of genes and often even outside of the genes themselves.  This makes it difficult to discern which genes underlie the association signals and by what mechanism.  This Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, an NIH Roadmap Initiative (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx), aims to provide this information.  

A cost reimbursement completion type contract with one or more priced options is anticipated.  This will be awarded under full and open competition as a negotiated acquisition. The LDACC is anticipated to be awarded on or about 5/07/2010. The NHLBI anticipates awarding a contract based on technical merit and funds availability.

This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP) and, although one award is anticipated, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The RFP will be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://fedbizopps.gov.  Prospective Offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments. It is also the Offerors’ responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of any amendments to the RFP. The RFP will contain all the information and details to allow potential Offerors to prepare and submit a contract proposal. This acquisition has been designated as a full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541711.  Subcontracting opportunities are anticipated during the course of this contract award.

NOTE:  PREPARATION COSTS – This presolicitation notice does not commit the Government to pay for preparation and submission of any materials.  The NHLBI is a consolidated Office of Acquisitions and serves as the R&D buyer for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) as well as five (5) other Institutes and Centers of the NIH.

Engineering and Design Services are required for an Indefinite Quantity Contract for various projects funded by the Government of Japan (GoJ) direct cash contributions (or otherwise referred to as the Mamizu funds) for the development of infrastructure and facilities covered by the Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI).

The contract coverage is primarily in Guam, U.S.A., but may include work in the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands (CNMI) or in locations anywhere in the Pacific and Indian Oceans under NAVFAC Pacific's areas of responsibility.  Planned projects include, but are not limited to, new construction and repair and alteration of base development facilities (including barracks, dormitories, administrative facilities, educational facilities, dining facilities, fire/police stations, fitness centers, gymnasiums, ball fields, and child development centers).   
Architect-Engineering and Engineering Services required under this contract include, but are not limited to, the preparation of project engineering documentation, DD 1391's, preliminary and final plans and specifications including preparation of Design-Build (DB) Request for Proposal (RFP) contract documents or Design Bid Build (DBB) contract documents, technical reports including engineering investigations and concept studies, preparation of facilities concept studies, facilities analysis concept development (FACD/charettes), construction cost estimates, operations and maintenance manuals, record drawings, shop drawing reviews, redi-check reviews and construction consultation and geotechnical investigations as required for design, analysis and studies.  Other support services may include post-construction award services; construction surveillance and inspection services; operational and maintenance support information services; and other miscellaneous post-construction awar! d services.
All work shall be performed in accordance with applicable Federal, State, and local policy, guidance, regulations, and laws including, but not limited to the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) Design Procedures, MIL-HDBK-1190 Facility Planning and Design Guide, and UFC 4-010-01 DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings.

In accordance with the contract or task order statement of work, the contractor shall complete necessary tasks and submittals or submit various reports to the Government that are readily useable in these applications without further adjustments.  
Evaluation and selection will be based on the most highly qualified firm upon evaluation of the selection criteria stated herein.  The A-E must demonstrate their and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published selection criteria for all services.  Selection criteria 1 through 9 are listed below in descending order of importance.  Specific selection criteria include:

Base development facilities include, but are not limited to, barracks, dormitories, administrative facilities, educational facilities, dining facilities, fire/police stations, fitness centers, gymnasiums, ball fields, and child development centers.  Individual features (barracks, dormitories, administrative facilities, educational facilities, dining facilities, fire/police stations, fitness centers, gymnasiums, ball fields, and child development centers) do not have to be within a single project scope; however, projects that contain several or all features ma! y be given more favorable consideration than projects that contain only individual features.  Also, base development projects designed and constructed in environments similar to Guam (remoteness, corrosiveness, etc.) will be considered more favorably.  List a maximum of ten (10) relevant projects completed in the past ten (10) years which best describe experience in design of base development projects discussed above.  A project or contract is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order, or an accumulation of related task orders under the same Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract having the features described above.
2.  Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence of the Individual Design Team Members:  Key personnel are identified as the Principal/Program Manager and Project Managers in the following disciplines:  Architectural, Structural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, and Geotechnical.  Limit submission to not more than ten (10) key personnel including the Principal/Program Manager, the Project Managers for each of the six major disciplines described above, and three other key personnel deemed by the firm to be most important to the success of the team.  For all 10 key personnel, explain the scope of responsibilities in the proposed organization and how the firm's organizational construct is most appropriate considering effectiveness and cost factors.
a.  Active U.S. professional registration.
b.  Past experience in the types of work described in Evaluation Factor 1 or evidence of similar relevant experience (with present and other firms) and roles of staff members specifically in design of base development projects described in Evaluation Factor 1.

A project or contract is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order, or an accumulation of related task orders under the same Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract having the features described above.
3.  Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated on past performance with respect to work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control (with emphasis on projects addressed in Evaluation Factor (1)), and cooperation and responsiveness.  Firms should include any letters of commendation or awards.  Firms will also be evaluated on performance evaluations obtained from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS).  
4.  Ability to perform the work in the required time and capacity to accomplish a variation of taskings simultaneously.
5.  Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.
a.  Past performance in utilization of small business concerns.  Provide (1) historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract revenues) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, SDVOSB, and HBCU/MI; (2) Information on national awards received within the past five years for outstanding support to SB concerns.  National awards received within the last five years will be considered more favorably than national awards beyond five years; (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontracting plans; (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protg agreements under either the DOD or SBA 8(a) Programs; (5) Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javits Wagner O Day Program by the National Industry for the Severely Handicapped (! NISH) or the National Industry for the Blind (NIB); and (6) Final SF 294s on projects/contracts completed within the past 3 years, and if subcontracting goals were not met, provide an explanation.
b.  Participation of small business concerns in this project.  Identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.
Firms are advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contracts per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB and SDVOSB, and 5% to HBCU/MI.  NAVFAC's FY09 subcontracting targets in terms of percentages of total subcontract effort are:  SB - 65%; SDB - 16.18%; WOSB - 14.53%; HUBZone SB - 1.42%; VOSB - 3%; and SDVOSV - .3%.  Firms not intending to subcontract and/or not meeting the respective SB goals should provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  In order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.

Identify examples indicating design team (including consultants) experience and concepts employed, LEED certification points anticipated and final LEED points awarded, and LEED certified professionals proposed for this contract.
7.  Quality Control Program:  Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to ensure technical accuracy and discipline coordination of plans and specifications.  List responsible key personnel. 
8.  Firm's location in the general geographical area of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract. 
9.  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense (DOD) within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.
Include the following items in Section H, Block 30 of the SF 330:  (1) a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria, (2) an organization chart  of the proposed team showing the names and roles of all key personnel listed in Section E with the associated firm as listed in Section C, (3) your DUNS, CAGE, and TIN numbers, and (4) evidence that your firm is permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering, i.e., State registration number.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The island shall be anchored near the center of the southern lobe of Sheepy Lake (Figure 1).  Sheepy Lake has an average surface elevation of approximately 4079 feet and is approximately 430 acres in size.  The proposed island shall float on the lake's surface and be made of recycled material consisting of polypropylene (from recycled carpet) and polyester (from recycled drinking bottles).  Layers of the matrix shall be bonded together with foam. The plastic material shall be stabilized with latex for enhanced UV protection. The island shall be covered by a mixture of small gravel/coarse sand and pumice in order to provide suitable nesting habitat for Caspian terns. <BR><BR><BR>a. Lower Klamath NWR is managed within the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges Complex, approximately 140 miles inland from the west coast of California. Lower Klamath NWR is in northeastern California (Siskiyou County) and southern Oregon (Klamath County).  The 50,092-acre refuge is a varied mix of intensively managed shallow marshes, open water, grassy uplands, and croplands that provide feeding, resting, nesting, and brood-rearing habitat for waterfowl and other water birds. Lower Klamath NWR receives water via a tunnel from sumps within Tule Lake NWR.  Most of the water that is received is used at the wetland units.  Any leftover water would flow into the Klamath Straits drain, which leads to the Klamath River.  Sheepy Lake of Lower Klamath NWR may also receive water as part of the distribution throughout the refuge but also is fed by tributaries Sheepy Creek and Cottonwood Creek. <BR>

<DESC>The US Army Medical Command, Pacific Regional Contracting Office (PRCO) has a requirement for one (1) Smart Cycler System manufactured by Cepheid, 904 E Caribbean Drive, Sunnyvale, CA  94089, in support of Brian Allgood Army Community Hospital (USAMEDDAC-K) In Yongsan, Seoul, Korea.  This requirement is to be purchased on a brand-name only basis.  The equipment to be ordered is as follows:  (1) Automated Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 16 site system, manufactured by Cepheid, which includes a Dell notebook computer, Cooling Block, Tubo Racks, and Mini-Centrifuge.  (2) Installation and Service shall be performed by a qualified/certified engineer at the end-users site along with operator manual.  (3) Shipping cost directly to Property Book Office, Unit #15281, Bldg #5421, ATTN:  Mr. Leeward Lee, Yongsan, Seoul, Korea, APO AP  96205-5281 (1 shipment only).  This solicitation will be issued for an anticipated Firm Fixed Price award.  This procurement will be issued using the procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The contract will be awarded on the basis of lowest price technically acceptable in accordance with the criteria stated in this solicitation.  Delivery will be required at the earliest delivery date available after award of order and shall be FOB Destination.  Final Inspection and Acceptance shall be at Destination.  The spectrofluorometers in the SmartCycler are unique to that instrument, allowing four fluorophores to be detected simultaneously. This allows the instrument to be used for multiplex assays in which four targets can be detected using different probes. Another advantage of the multiple fluorophore detection is that internal controls and inhibition controls can be run at the same time. This is critical for the regulatory requirements in clinical diagnostics. The SmartCycler is also capable of performing different reaction conditions for each of its 16 PCR units. Most importantly, the FDA-approved Prodesse proFLU+ influenza and RSV assay can only be performed on the SmartCycler. Other FDA-approved molecular diagnostic assays, including kits for MRSA and GBS detection, can only be run on the SmartCycler.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor the ASFI website for amendments that maybe be issued to this solicitation.  For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a quote will be provided any changes and/or amendments and considered for future clarifications and/or award.  Any firm that believes it can provide the stated supplies/equipment is invited to submit a written notification to PRCO within five (5) calendar days from the date of publication of this notice but no later than the closing date/time specified on the solicitation.  A copy of this request for quote/solicitation is available on FACNET/ASFI and at https://acquisition.army.mil or upon request. All quotes/proposals are due at 10:00 a.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on Thursday, May 28, 2009. The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Request for Information<br />Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council (AFMSCC)<br />Coding and Collections Processing<br />22 May 09<br /></strong><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the government to acquire any product or services. It does not guarantee a subsequent solicitation will be issued. Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and costs associated with any submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government. The information requested will be used by the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) to facilitate decision making.
<p>The Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council (AFMSCC) is seeking interested sources to provide combined medical coding and collections processing for 63 U.S. based military treatment facilities. The Air Force currently uses separate contracts for obtaining these services and is interested in obtaining industry's perspective on whether combining medical coding and third party billing would increase efficiency, lower cost, reduce errors and improve collections from third party insurers. Studies, analysis, and comparison to Federal health facilities or commercial health systems would provide meaningful data. The Air Force seeks feedback on processes to combine multiple hospitals into an efficient collections system using both paper-based records and through the DoD longitudinal health record AHLTA.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense is highly concerned about fraud prevention. The one methodology to potentially reduce fraud by overcoding of records is to maintain administrative separation of a medical record audit function. The Air Force seeks industry comment on this methodology as to whether a separate audit function could curtail billing fraud and any other processes or procedures used in commercial practice.</p>
<p>The input provided will help the Air Force ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offerors. A review of available North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes finds that NAICS 561440 (Collection Agencies), NAICS 561110 (Office Administrative Services) and NAICS 621999 (All Other Miscellaneous Ambulatory Health Care Service) most closely resembles these services. Comments on the NAICS code selection are welcomed. If you are an interested large or small business, the AFMSCC would appreciate your assistance. In addition to any supplemental information provided please provide:<br />1) The name of the business<br />2) The business classification (large/small) and NAICS code used<br />3) Whether current services are provided on a national scale (large health care system) or local hospital system<br />4) The name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative the Government may contact for additional information.</p>
<p>E-mailed responses are required. Because this is a preliminary RFI, long responses and large files containing marketing materials are not required. Files over 10MB will be rejected by the email server. The Air Force is not scheduling in-person presentations at this time.</p>
<p>Notice: The Air Force has non-government (contractor) employees assisting with its market research. These non-government employees, who have all signed nondisclosure agreements, will have access to industry responses. <br />Information gained through this RFI will be used to further define the AFMS requirements. Individual capability briefs will not be accepted at this time. Interested parties are urged to monitor the official Government Point of Entry at www.fedbizopps.gov for future announcements regarding AFMS needs. It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site regularly for any changes or updates. Vendors can subscribe to the FedBizOpps Vendor Notification Service to receive emails notifying them of all notices for a particular solicitation number, all notices from selected organizations and product service classifications (NAICS codes) or all procurement notices. To register for this service, click on "Vendor Notification Service" at the FedBizOpps home page. Then click on the subscription option desired and follow the instructions. This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification. Subscribers to this list service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the Federal Business Opportunities site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions. <br />Please note, the government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI.</p>

<DESC><p>1. Introduction. The Headquarters Air Force Services Agency (HQ AFSVA) is looking for a web based software application that will support our Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) activities. One of the primary users will be the Air Force Catering Program. Catering falls under the Air Force Club system which uses a membership program (credit card/proprietary card) to offer discounts to club members. 2. Project Scope. Catering operations can be seen as two separate functions: First will be the activity/catering manager who works with the customer hosting the event to develop the event requirements. The event requirements will include at a minimum: 1. Customer Name 2. Customer Contact Info 3. Event Purpose 4. Event Date and Time 5. Minimum and Maximum Attendees 6. Configuration of event location (tables, chairs, bars) 7. Menu Choices (Hors d&rsquo; ourves, meals, beverages) with member/non-member prices 8. Costing/estimate &ndash; Payment (if any) Second, will be the attendee access to the event reservations. The attendee shall be able to use the Internet to locate the event planning site, and then based on their home of assignment shall be able to view upcoming events in their local area. While the local area shall be the default, the customer should still be able to search globally for events at other Air Force installations. The requirement will at a minimum include: 1. Attendee Name 2. Attendee Contact Info 3. Number of seats required 4. Names of additional guests (membership status to determine meal cost) 5. Payment options (use of the Club Card entitles the customer to the discount) 6. Confirmation number The system must have the ability for the attendee to cancel their reservations within a set number of hours (modifiable by the Activity/catering manager) prior to the event, and it must allow for the activity/catering manager to cancel the entire event (triggering a refund to all attendees) in case of an emergency/disaster. The entire system shall meet/maintain standard Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance. Catering Managers shall have either e-mail or telephone support available within a reasonable amount of time. 3. Operations. The AFSVA owns and operates activities at 99 Air Force Bases world-wide. 4. Respondents. As part of your response, please indicate if a demonstration of your system can be given at HQ AFSVA, 10100 Reunion Place, Ste 304, San Antonio, TX 78216. 5. Replies to RFI . To maintain consistency and equality in this process, vendors are requested to use the structure outlined for their response. a. Cover Page b. Vendor Name c. Vendor address d. contract information for the vendor representative e. Response to the substance of this RFI f. Brochures and/or other literature 6. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). Any inquiries about or requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. It does not, in it issuance, restrict the NAFIs as to their ultimate acquisition approach. 7. While a hardcopy is acceptable, e-mail is the preferred submission method. The file should be in Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Word format. It should be sent to the individual below no later than 22 June 2009, 4:30 PM Central Standard Time. &nbsp;Ms. Helen Miller, AFNAF Purchasing office, 10100 Reunion Place, Ste 304 San Antonio, TX 78216 (210) 652-6931 ext. 7144 (Voice), (210) 652-6309 (Fax) Helen.miller@randolph.af.mil</p>

Please review summary of requirement below.  Request that interested parties submit capabilities statements and small business status/size no later than close of business Friday, May 29, 2009.  Requested information to be submitted electronically to Angela Hook at angela.hook@us.army.mil .<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT:<BR><BR>Facility Decontamination:  The buildings identified for disassembly and inspection (D/I) shall be decontaminated (if required) in accordance with DoD Instruction 4140.62, dated 25 Nov 08 and CENNC-OE-CX Document 06-03, dated 27 Jan 06<BR>         <BR><BR>Explosive Decontamination of Buildings:  These are storage facilities, which housed finished propellant in sealed canisters and/or nitrocellulose (N/C) in rail car storage.   The Army has characterized these facilities as D/I in the Explosive Safety Submission (ESS).  The conditional restriction on the D/I classification is to visually inspect the floor for propellant and/or N/C.  The only reason why explosive contamination could occur was if the container seal was broken, and the container contents spilled. Prior to the start of work, an approved Work Plan and Safety/Health Plan will be required. The COE two-100% visual explosives inspections process shall be performed to determine whether the facilities are considered safe or unsafe for transfer/private reuse. If the buildings are found to be explosive free, no decontamination activity will be required. If explosive contamination presence is confirmed, the contractor shall collect/remove explosives as follows:<BR><BR>         The contractor shall collect the propellant and/or N/C manually (wetting it down, then collecting it with spark proof shovels, or sweep it up with an explosive proof vacuum), bag, label and dispose of the materials. For all explosive decontamination activities associated with this visual inspection and disposal activity, the contractor shall perform the efforts and provide written certification that the facilities are explosive free. Electronic photos and a daily log of inspection activities shall be prepared and documented. The daily log shall include the name of the inspector, date, time, building number, condition found, and action taken.<BR><BR>Explosive Testing of Change House Drains:  After employees finished working in the propellant or explosives production facilities, they disrobed from their production garments, showered and changed into their personal clothes.  Subsequently, any propellant from their work clothes or skin might have been discharged into the floor drains and/or wash basins.  Floor drains and wash basins in the 707 series buildings identified in Encl 4 shall be visually inspected, field-tested, and laboratory analyzed for explosive presence. This shall include any discharge point or septic tank associated with the 707 series buildings. Digital photographs will be taken for all drains or discharge point.  Final reports shall denote name of inspector, time of inspection, date of inspection, location, field-test and laboratory results from the samples taken. Prior to the start of work, an approved Work Plan and Safety/Health Plan will be required.   <BR>

Similar products are:</p>

<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 5, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format.

<DESC>Solicitation Number: NHLBI-PB-(EB)-2009-159-JNB

This is a solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the Format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB-(EB)-2009-159-JNB, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32 (May 14, 2009).

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering’s (NIBIB) Biophysical Characterization of Macromolecules Study Group, to procure a Hi Resolution Camera (Catalog Number 03ZEQA1000IF), from supplier Andor Technology, 425 Sullivan Avenue, Suite 3, South Windsor, CT 96074.      
The sole source determination is based on the need of the Characterization of Macromolecules Study, and up to 95% of all other studies conducted within the NIBIB.  Study Reference Frames, which are established at the start of the study, can not be changed with the introduction of equipment that is deemed to be calibrated outside of the initially calibrated tolerances of the study.
Andor’s iXonEM+ 897 back-illuminated EMCCD has single photon detection capability combined with >90% QE. iXonEM+ is designed to extract the absolute best from quantitative EMCCD technology across all critical performance parameters. This highly popular 512 x 512 frame transfer format delivers unequalled thermoelectric cooling down to -100°C, industry-lowest clock induced charge noise, and operates at 35 frames/sec (full resolution). Andor’s rapid vertical shift capability gives distinct speed advantages when operated with binning/sub-array, whilst minimizing vertical smear. EMCCD and conventional CCD readout modes provide heightened application flexibility. The absolute EM gain multiplication can be varied linearly from unity up to a thousand times directly via RealGainTM, a true quantitative EM gain scale. To combat the gainageing phenomenon inherent to back-illuminated EMCCDs, Andor’s EMCALTM is a unique and innovative user-initiated routine, performing auto-recalibration of the EM Gain scale, without need for a light source, and circumventing the need for factory recalibration. 
A Hi Resolution Camera is required to have true linear gain at all operating temperatures. Specifications for the Andor Hi Resolution Camera include: 1) 512 x 512, 16um, EMCCD, BV, 10 MHZ, - 100C (DU-897E-CSO-#BV). 2) 1024 x 1024, 13 um, EMCCD, BV, 10 MHZ, - 100C (DU-888E-COO-BV). 3) 100 x 1002, Burn, EMCCD, VP, 35 MHZ, - 95C (DU-885K-CSO-#VP). 4) IXON PCI Controller Card (CCI-23). 5) Imaging Software (PN: SOLIS (1)).

<DESC>The Department of Interior, National Parks Service, AZ MABO Office, 1824 S. Thompson Street, Flagstaff, Arizona 86001 plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with Western Mapping Company of Tucson, Arizona to prepare topographic and planimetric maps from previously obtained ortho photo imagery; provide analysis and associated reports.  Negotiations will be conducted pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1, which allows for negotiation without full and open competition if there is only one or a limited number responsible sources. The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the agency requirements. The basis for this determination is the estimated significant costs for duplication of resources, including time.  Western Mapping Company already has much of this data on file from previous work at the Park, and duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through the competitive process.
This notice of intent is NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their capability to perform such services by submitting documentation to elizabeth.baierl@nps.gov at the office identified above. Documentation must be received within 45 calendar days after the date of publication of this synopsis.

<DESC>ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302.1 to Agilent Technologies, Inc., North American Contact Center, Agilent Business Center, 9780 S Meridian Blvd., Englewood, CO  80112-5910.  This procurement is being conducted under Simkplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)-only one resposible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Agilent Technologies is the only known source capable of meeting the Government's requirements due to the unique capability to provide support and service for the Agilent lab equipment.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 CST on 29 May 2009.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to complete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent.  Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the Government to ellaine.r.james@usace.army.mil with solicitation number referenced in the subject line.<BR><BR>This procurement is to purchase 10 pieces of lab equipment from Agilent Technologies for use in the geophysical properties laboratory.  Included in this acquisition are: 1146A 100 kHz, 100 A, ac/dc Current Probe, N2779A 3 Channel Power Supply for N278xA Current Probe, 1147A 50 MHz, 15A ac/dc Current Probe with AutoProbe,  N2782A 50MHz, 30A ac/dc Current Probe, N2783A 100MHz, 30A ac/dc Current Probe,  85070E Dielectric Probe Kit, 85071E Material Measurement Software, DSO7104A 1GHz, 4-Channel Oscilloscope, U1604A 40Mhz Handheld Digital Oscilloscope, U1571A NiMH Battery Pack 4500mA, and U1590A Soft Casing.  Operational requirements include the ability to measure soils electrical, magnetic, and electromagnetic properties as equivalent circuits.<BR><BR>The Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Tunnel Detection and Deterrence Team has received urgent and compelling requests from multiple federal agencies including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Justice (DOJ), several entities of the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of State (DOS) and their sub-elements including Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), US Border Patrol, the Combating Terrorism Threat-Reduction Working Group (TSWG), and Joint Task Force-North (JTF-N) of US NORTHCOM.  All of the requests require the capability to model the geophysical response of the subsurface with multiple methodologies.  This procurement will provide the capability for the ERDC Tunnel Detection and Deterrence Team to use the Agilent Technologies lab equipment for a variety of critical research projects in-theater and on US borders, as well as at embassies and in OCONUS applications for other national governments as requested by the US DOS.  The resulting capability can be used to determine critical geophysical properties of shallow subsurface soils and the interaction of soil properties with geophysical sensors used for site characterization; in detection and discrimination of clandestine tunnels and underground facilities; detection and deterrence of clandestine tunneling activities; and in the detection of improvised explosive devices.  This capability will be instrumental in completing current reimbursable OCO projects for the agencies listed in paragraph 1a, and in initiating additional reimbursable and direct-funded military projects currently proposed.<BR><BR>The ERDC Tunnel Detection and Deterrence Team needs the capability to empirically measure relevant soil properties in the laboratory to improve subsurface modeling efforts.  Lack of this capability is severely limiting the ERDC capability to meet the strict requirement for near-real-time interpretations during ongoing and future deployment to the southwest US Border and OCONUS for classified projects that are part of the Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO). <BR><BR>Agilent Technologies lab equipment is needed as soon as possible to finish the updates to the geophysical properties laboratory.  The laboratory is needed to complete soil property measurements on soils from Iraq and Afghanistan to help reduce the impact of improvised explosive devices.<BR>

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
The requirement is to provide  a sexualt assault training that distinguishes itself by mixing improvisational comedy, education and audience interaction.  Provokes discussion about dating, sex and the issue of consent.  Explores how social pressures, gender roles sterotypes, power inequity, false preconceptions and unrealistic fantasies can make social interaction, as well as dating, a challenge.  Presenters need to show how these factors can lead to sexual assault and teach the audience the true nature of rape  The training needs to use humor to engage the audience into candid discussions about their beliefs and experiences.  The presenters will strike a balance between laughing about the differences between men and women and clearly communicating the serious messages about how we all should treat each other.  Creates the critical dialogue necessary to dissolve enduring rape myths and encourages thoughtful, accountable intimate behavior.  Teaches the difference between coer! cion and consent.  It needs to challenge audiences who have mislabeled coercive behavior as seduction and to reexamine a culture that too often holds victims of rape responsible for their own vulnerability.  Encourages the audience to both provide solutions for creating safer and healthier interpersonal sexual relationships and brainstorm how they could positively intervene as bystanders when they witness a friend or stranger in a vulnerable situation that could lead to sexual violence.  The training should be relatable to the military lifestyle and should reflect the military jargon, customs and courtesies.    The training will take place on all Marine Corps Bases on Okinawa, Japan over a 5 day period, 3 trainings per day, a total of 15, 60-90min training sessions.
Anticipated award date is 1 June, 2009. Point of contact is Sgt Philip Pickens: Email Philip.pickens@usmc.mil.

<DESC>Department of Veterans AffairsVISN 16Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity  	Department of Veterans Affairs	Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System (CAVHS)	4300 West 7th Street	Little Rock, AR 722052.	Nature/Description of Action	Contract Award using the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2) "Unusual and Compelling 	Urgency" to purchase replacement Heart Mapping Equipment for the  	Electrophysiology Laboratory at John L. McClellan Hospital in Little Rock Arkansas.3.	Description of Supplies/Services	The equipment system purchased is an EnSite System manufactured by St. Jude 	Medical, Model # EE3000.  Warranty, Installation and technical support for the 	first year are included in the cost.   System functions to provide 3-D mapping of a 	patient's cardiac chamber allowing for physicians to locate and diagnose 	arrhythmias and confirm success of procedures.	Estimated Value: $ 316,975.004.	Identification of Statutory Authority	(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)   Only One Responsible Source	(X)  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2)   Unusual and Compelling Urgency	(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (3)   Industrial, Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental, or                                                                                                                                                     		Research Capability or Expert Services	(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (4)   International Agreement	(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (5)   Authorized or Required by Statute	(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (6)   National Security	(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (7)   Public Interest5.	Rationale in support of citation in Paragraph 4 above:a.	Description of contractor and or of acquisition action that demonstrates that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:		St. Jude Medical has a system available and it can be delivered and installed in 2 	weeks from date of order.  There is no other current source known that can provide 	the equipment need on the urgent basis required.  The existing Carto mapping 	system is 6 year old and has had three work orders for repairs during the past 	several months, plus the Cath Lab Technicians were able to get it going again 	themselves and didn't enter work orders when it malfunctioned two other times 	during that period.  The computer "backs out" in the middle of an invasive 	interventional procedure to treat atrial fibrillation.  It goes back to the default page, 	leaving the Cardiologist without 3-D images of the catheter in the patient's heart 	until the staff re-enter all the patient data and get the Carto back to the point where 	it failed.  All the mapping recorded prior to the computer failure is lost, and 	depending upon how far along they were when the failure occurred, it can take as 	much as three or four hours to recreate that mapping in order to complete the case.  	A typical case using the Carto can expose a patient to several hours of radiation 	(much greater than with the EnSite system) and having to repeat much of the 	mapping compounds the risk to the patient from radiation exposure.Although it hasn't happened so far, procedures will have to be rescheduled if the Carto fails and cannot be restarted.  If a procedure is aborted, the Cardiologist will be able to use fluoro imaging to remove the catheter, but the patient will have to be rescheduled for a repeat EP on a day when Anesthesiology is available to work in the lab.  If the delay is more than three weeks, the patient will require a repeat MRI and a repeat TEE (Tran esophageal echo).  All these extra procedures increase the inconvenience and risk for the patient and the cost to the VA, and they lengthen waiting times for other patients.The unreliability of the current mapping system poses multiple risks to patients in the EP Lab.  The 3D images of the catheter are lost in the middle of an invasive procedure, excessive radiation exposure increases the risk of these procedures, and patients with artrial fibrillation are at risk of developing a life-threatening clot while they are waiting to be rescheduled.b.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practical:		Another system was considered by medical staff for possible use before the 	decision was make to use the Ensite System.  The System manufactured by 	Siemens Medical named CARTO XP EP Navigation System was reviewed and 	found not to provide the same function advantages and requires additional per 	patient cost for disposables that the Ensite System does not require.   In addition, 	the CARTO System specifications reviewed did not provide for the first year 	software and	maintenance upgrade without additional cost that the Ensite System 	does.         c.	If the Sole Source Exception (c) (1) was chosen, state the date of synopsis or the     basis for waivers.  N/A   d.   If the Urgency Exception was chosen and this J&A was prepared after the 	procurement action was carried out, state the reasons.	While other companies may have been able to meet the delivery requirements for 	the new system, the possible danger to patients and potential risk from exposure to 	radiation as stated above in paragraph 5a does not allow time to build a solicition, 	issue and receive and evaluate offers from multiple sources.  The risk to patients 	while the acquisition process is being conducted is greater than the benefit to the 	VHA for increased competition.       	The above acquisition will be negotiated with:		St Jude Medical	 #1 Lillehei Plaza	St. Paul, MN 551176.	Determination of a Fair and Reasonable Cost	The Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated cost to the government isl  	be fair and reasonable.  A comparison of previous equipment costs and other 	known manufacture system cost was made to determine the cost to be comparable 	with existing system cost and should result I some cost saving to the CAVHS in 	lower disposable costs and software upgrades for the first year (see Attached Price 	Analysis.7.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.      A review on known sources of equipment of the type required was conducted and 	the two systems previously discussed where found to be capable of satisfy the 	VHA, additional sources are not known.8.	Additional Support for the use of other than full and open competition:	c. When the urgency exception is cited provide the data, estimate of cost or other 	rationale as to the extent of harm to the government if the contract is not awarded 	expediently:	As stated previously the continued use of the existing system poses unacceptable 	risks to patient health.  The equipment itself is essential to current daily hospital 	operations and delay in award decreases the capabilities of the Electrophysiology 	Laboratory to provide veteran's safe, competent healthcare.9.	Sources expressing an interest:  No additional Sources were solicited.     10. Actions, if any, being taken to remove barriers to full and open competition:	Requirements personnel did not anticipate the problems with the current system.  	The new system will be included in the labs equipment replacement schedule and 	should be identified for future maintenance and upgrades and eventually 	replacement.     11. Delivery Requirements:	System is required to be delivered installed as quickly as possible the current 	delivery schedule and installation completion date is May 8, 2009.     12.  Acquisition Plan: An Acquisition Plan   (  ) is (X) is not required for this 	acquisition.	13. IT Approval: IT Approval (  ) is (X) is not required for this acquisition. If it is, 	include appropriate approvals.  	Technical/Requirements Personnel Certification:	I hereby certify that the supporting data forming the basis for this justification is complete and accurate.

If required access is less than 7 days, contractors are issued an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass. CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract.

The CO will verify the names and number of badges on the letter utilizing their copy of the USAFA Form 111. The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor's original letter to PRC. By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)<br />ADDENDUM - USAF Academy Invoicing Instruction (Revised 4/23/08)<br />a.

<DESC>The IRS intends to issue a competitive RFQ/RFP for the following brand name requirement: Informative Graphics Corporation (IGC) for the consolidation of several IGC supplied IT licenses.    This consolidation includes:  34,215 Brava client licenses, 22 Brava server licenses, and 16 Net-It Enterprise Server licenses. Option years for the maintenance from the current cycle date for each product through:
•	September 30, 2009; as the base, 
•	Option 1 from October 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010, and 
•	Option 2 and 3 to provide the recurring annual maintenance effective April 1, 2010 and April 1, 2011.  

Account Management Services (AMS), one of the four pillars of modernization, has a need to consolidate software licenses that were acquired through 6 different purchases, therefore requiring 6 different life cycle dates for maintenance.  These software licenses are currently used by the IRS.  This affords IGC to be the most qualified to continue their support for the licenses maintenance; while also providing the Government the opportunity to consolidate all the life cycles under one order, saving the Government time and costs, as well as securing the Governments future maintenance cost through option years. The maintenance provided by IGC is the only service available under these licenses, as the IRS is currently within a maintenance cycle (on several of the licenses).  IGC is also the most compliant maintenance provider available on the market for these particular licenses, as well as, meets the IRS Enterprise Architecture compliance.  

This is not an RFQ but a notice of intent to procure brand name requirement IGC.  The IRS is not requesting information from resellers of the brand name but manufacturers that can perform the brand name equivalent.  All manufacturers that can perform the equivalent function/services should submit their technical qualifications and literature to the following address:  Kathy.l.winemiller@irs.gov .  The requirement will close on May 29, 2009, at 2 pm EST.

Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):<BR><BR>1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR><BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;<BR><BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<BR><BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or     <BR><BR>(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).<BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.

Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class (es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C) (VI)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class (es) is to be conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation) and computes a proposed rate).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.

Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):<BR><BR>1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer  System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example,  if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR><BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;<BR><BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<BR><BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or     <BR><BR>(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).<BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regarding and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that Represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to Ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials Which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the Employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the Like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR><BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and Incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (Either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or Local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by Laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an Employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage Determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR><BR>Following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR><BR>Laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet.

This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.

Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):<BR><BR>1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer  System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example,  if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR><BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;<BR><BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<BR><BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or     <BR><BR>(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).<BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regarding and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that Represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to Ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials Which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the Employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the Like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR><BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and Incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (Either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or Local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by Laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an Employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage Determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR><BR>Following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR><BR>Laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR><BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation) and computes a proposed rate).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>Classification: UNCLASSIFIED <BR><BR>Caveats: NONE<BR>

Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):<BR><BR>1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer  System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example,  if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR><BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;<BR><BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<BR><BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or     <BR><BR>(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).<BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regarding and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that Represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to Ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials Which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the Employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the Like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR><BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and Incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (Either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or Local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by Laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an Employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage Determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR><BR>Following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR><BR>Laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR><BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation) and computes a proposed rate).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>Classification: UNCLASSIFIED <BR><BR>Caveats: NONE<BR>

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), Laboratory of Zoonotic Virology (LV), has been charged with performing basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human viral pathogens. The Transcriptome sequencing of a Hamster species, a model of viral infection in LV, will contribute towards these goals. SCHEDULE: The RML has a need to sequence using the GS FLX titanium series technology libraries from 6(six) different Syrian Hamster tissues to approximately 20X coverage with assembly or clustering performed and Blast searches and annotation of the assembled or clustered sequences. The goal of this effort will be to produce an expression assembly of the Hamster genome for future use in developing a custom array. The contractor shall provide to LV and the RTS services to sequence hamster RNA to ~20X using GS FLX titanium series technology chemistry, run an assembly annotate for the new assembly and upload the data into the RML ERGO server.<br />This is a 1-2 month, one time work effort, where the final product will be an expression Hamster genome annotated and uploaded into RML ERGO. Step 1: High Throughput RNA sequencing shall be performed by pyrosequencing technology using a 454 GSFLx sequencing machine and GS FLX titanium series technology. The bead-based library construction and operation of the 454 technology shall be performed at the highest levels of quality possible. Quality sequence shall occur and be ensured and maintained throughout the work effort. The whole genome sequencing approach shall be assembled with the current, state-of-the-art algorithms. The goal of this project is to obtain near full length sequence for all transcripts expressed within the tissues. The RNA is isolated and provided to the contractor. Assembly can use the 454 Newbler Assembler that is compatible with the 454 GSFLx. Following the total, complete assembly of all data, the contractor shall use public and proprietary gene identification tools and technologies to identify expressed, open reading frames (ORFs) in the newly assembled sequence. Widely known and used Bioinformatics algorithms such as CRITICA and Glimmer and other well-known tools such as ProkPeg shall be used. Protein encoding regions and coding RNAs shall be identified. SCF-formatted trace data and the assembled contigs in FASTA format shall be available for download by FTP. The Trace data shall be readable by standard sequencing reading and editable software. Genomic data shall be uploaded into the RML ERGO server. Data shall be compatible with ERGO naming conventions and upload requirements. At no time shall the interface or upload of genomic data affect the service and support contract currently in place for the RML ERGO server. The contractor shall provide EMBL-formatted ASCII files containing all contig, protein sequence and annotation information by CD-ROM for data storage at RML. The highest level of quality and attention to detail shall be performed throughout all stages of the project for this hamster genome effort. The contractor shall keep all RML-derived data secure and shall not release or maintain any of the data beyond this contract effort.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541711 and the small business size is 500. The Rocky Mountain Laboratories(RML), is in need of a ERGO license renewal. RML has sequenced several pathogen genomes. Determining the chemical sequence of the DNA of the pathogenic organisms is a critical first step in the development of diagnostics, vaccines and chemotherapeutics against deadly human pathogens. A critical aspect of sequencing and processing of the data from multiple bacterial genomes is the use of servers and bioinformatics software to store, analyze and present genome data. The RML currently has an ERGO server on site for the processing, storing and presentation of bacterial pathogen genome data. The ERGO server is used by the entire Division of Intermural Research(DIR). This RML ERGO server and the software that runs on it needs to be covered by a service and support contract to supply unlimited phone and email support, quarterly data updates, an ERGO gene expression module and a genomic data supplement. The contractor shall provide to RML a 1(one) year License Renewal, including 4(four) quarterly data updates of existing genomic data, all new public genome data added to the ERGO database throughout the year, and proprietary customer data from any sequencing and annotation projects performed with Integrated Genomics. Any software improvements to the core system shall also be provided at the time of update. This renewal includes unlimited phone and e-mail support, experienced bioinformatics and software development teams. Integrated Genomics shall include 8(eight) hours of web-ex based demonstrations and training. Data files must be compatible, transferable to and readable by a contractor-supplied server with ERGO bioinformatics software and RML computing systems and infrastructure which involves PC, MAC and Unix/Linux-based systems. The RML ERGO server consists of the ERGO Genome Analysis Suite. The contractor shall provide all personnel for the work effort. The contractor shall work closely with RML IT staff members to insure the server is properly updated and that RML IT guidelines and security measures are met. The contractor shall keep all NIH, RML-derived data secure and will not release, make public or maintain any of the RML data beyond this contract effort. If Internet connectivity is needed in order to perform the work, for transfer of files, or other efforts, contractor computers will be secure and in compliance with RML-IT security procedures and policies. Contractor supplied software shall be kept current and up to date with applicable security patches and upgrades. Internet connectivity and/or remote access for the purpose of performing the work, for transfer of files, or other efforts, will be coordinated with NIAID IT staff to ensure security and compliance with NIAID IT procedures and policies. The contractor shall provide to the RML Project Officer contact information for the Project Manager that will oversee the service support contract. The Contractor shall produce/provide the following deliverables: l) Unlimited phone and email support for the RML ERGO server and software for one(1) year. 2) 4(four) quarterly ERGO database upgrades for genomic data in the public domain, genomes already present on the RML ERGO server, and all genomes performed at RML. The first quarterly updates shall be scheduled immediately upon receipt of the licensing fees and Rocky Mountain Laboratories shipping information. Subsequent updates will be delivered at approximately 60(sixty) business day intervals following the first update. This upgrade for all publicly available genomes shall be completely compatible with the infrastructure and format of the RML ERGO server. Cross genome comparative analysis must be available, prediction of translation starts, sequence similarities, functional annotation, and orthologous cluster analysis. Additional methods that rely on gene context rather than on sequence similarity must also used for annotation of those genomes. 3)ERGO gene expression module for integration of micro array data (spotted and Affymetrix chip data) into gene function and context pathways. Inspection Criteria: All service and support will be inspected and approved by the Project Officer of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories via weekly reports and analysis of deliverables. Acceptance Criteria: Will be based upon decisions made by the Project Officer in conjunction with the service, support and the deliverables mentioned above.

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  

The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian republics.  The U.S. Government’s program of assistance in the region is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare.  It ranks as one of the Agency’s largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $100 million annually.  The Mission implements its programs together with more than 80 contractor and grantee teams.  The staff manages a program that addresses six Strategic Objectives (SO) principally focused on assisting these former communist states in making the transition to Western-style democracies with viable market economies.

The Mission currently has three technical offices:  Office of Economic Growth (EG), Democracy and Conflict Mitigation (DM), and Health and Education (HE) and is in the process of implementation of the 2007-2011 Strategy.  The Office of Economic Growth (EG) is responsible for the management of a large portfolio under Objective 4 Economic Growth with seven Program Areas:

Lead discussions, negotiations, and other contacts at senior policy and technical levels of the U.S. Embassies in Central Asia and other US Government entities, to develop and implement the U.S. Mission’s economic policy reform strategy.  Identify, gather information and develop linkages with other donor programs, particularly the World Bank, EBRD, International Monetary Fund, and EU-TACIS.  Conceptualize and design projects and program activities that achieve identified priorities and objectives.  Lead or be a key member of technical selection committees for the award of procurement instruments.    As relevant, the EPDS will also conduct research and advise other sector teams to inform strategy and program design and management.  Work with other offices within the Mission to generate synergies and complementary activities.

Solicitation Number: 3CW-09-A-0003

The United States Postal Service (USPS) has issued Solicitation # 3CW-09-A-0003 to pre-qualified suppliers for the operation of a Mail Transportation Equipment Service Center (MTESC) to be located in the Detroit, Michigan area. The USPS will accept offers only from pre-qualified suppliers for the operation of a Mail Transportation Equipment Service Center (MTESC).  The Solicitation # 3CW-09-A-0003 was issued directly to the prequalified suppliers on Wednesday, May 20, 2009. The proposals are due by 06/22/2009, 3:00 PM EST.  

The Detroit MTESC is part of a network of MTESC sites.  The purpose of the Mail Transport Equipment (MTE) network is to ensure an adequate supply of high-quality MTE ready for rapid deployment to Postal facilities and their customers.   MTESCs will process the MTEs as specified in the statement of work.  The MTESC will receive MTE, examine it, and route it for reuse if serviceable, repair it if defective but repairable, or dispose of it if beyond repair. (Disposal may be through waste pickup or material recycling and will be directed by the Postal Service.) Each MTESC in the network will be responsible for processing and repairing MTE for use by Postal facilities and commercial mailers.  The MTE network will provide an efficient means of continuously improving the management of MTE processing, repair, and distribution functions. Other benefits expected from the MTE network include better MTE performance and life cycle data and improved control over the disposal of condemned MTE. The MTE network will also allow Postal Service Area and Headquarters staff to continuously balance MTE inventories within and among all Postal Service Areas both effectively and efficiently.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Description:<BR><BR>	  Questions received from interested participants and our responses follow:<BR><BR><BR>19. Question:  The quantities for line items #0008 and #0009 stayed the same when the unit was changed from SF to CY. Did the quantities change this much? They are very much out of proportion from the original bid. If the units were CF the quantities would be about the same. If these two line items are bid at this high quantity of CY they will dominate the bid.<BR><BR>RESPONSE: Revised Bid Schedule is atteched<BR><BR>20. Question: Line item #0008 is for pads from 6 to 14 and is measured in CY. If concrete is over 14 thick what line item will be used?<BR><BR>RESPONSE: 0008. See Revised Bid Schedule<BR><BR>21. Question: Line item #0009. The outside walls of the Korean War buildings we were shown have 24 x 36 columns every 26 feet with ten or twelve 40 foot lengths of 1  rebar in them. Since the concrete cant be larger than 3 x 2 x 18 when taken to the landfill, does the contractor have to cut all these pieces of rebar that is in the concrete? The cubic yard cost for removing this wall is very different than removing an 8 cinderblock wall with no rebar in it. Is it possible to make two line items for these very different items?<BR><BR>RESPONSE: Yes, Shall be required to  cut rebar in concrete.  See Revised Bid Schedule<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>22. Question: Line item #0008. The base of the chimney in a Korean War building is a 15 foot octagon that is 3 feet thick and filled with rebar. The cubic yard cost for removing this concrete is very different from the cost of removing an 8 to 10 thick pad with little or no wire in it. Is it possible to make two line items for these very different items?<BR><BR>RESPONSE: See Revised Bid Schedule<BR><BR><BR>Closing date is extended to 05-27-2009 1:00 P.M. CT.

<DESC>Amendment #1

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is a total Small Business Set-Aside and an award will be made utilizing the simplified acquisition procedures under FAR Subpart 13.5. Responses will be accepted only from qualified small businesses.  The following provisions are applicable to this commercial item acquisition: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contracts Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Status or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.  Award will be made to the responsive, responsible vendor with the lowest price.  ATF will award this requirement on an all or none basis.  Award will be made to the vendor offering the lowest price and meeting all the requirements.  Proposals must include price, and best delivery time. Proposals are acceptable via e-mail at james.huff@atf.gov or via facsimile machine at 202/648-9659, Attn: Jim Huff.  The award winner must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database  http://www.ccr.gov/. to receive the award.  

Amendment #2

Question #1 

Section 3 Cabinetry/Cabinet: Do you have a layout drawing or design on the cabinet. It appears to be a “single drawer weapons locker”, but discusses adjustable shelves, vertical dividers and doors.  

In regards to the Section 3, there is an attached drawing. The items identified (shelving, doors, etc.) is a generic description scope of work, this will not apply to these units.  However, dividers will be part of the drawer system to provide the handler options.

Question #2 

Will the chassis be delivered?

It is NOW requested that the contractor provide a cost estimate to pick up these units at our warehouse in Sterling, Virginia via trucking company and drop ship via trucking company two units at Glynco Ga., one unit at Dallas, Texas, and one unit at Sterling Virginia. Complete address will be provided upon award of the contract. This is a change to the original statement of work.

Question #3  

Can you clarify the layout?

It is a basic layout as far as a police package goes.  It states in the scope of work plans need to be submitted for all electrical, cabinetry, and console before work will begin.  This means that the contractor will have to provide proof of their knowledge of law enforcement vehicles and be able to work closely with ATF before any work is to begin. 

Amendment #3

Question #4

Federal Signal and Code 3 make comparable products that would work seamlessly into your existing fleet, and we would be glad to build a pilot vehicle for your evaluation, or send samples to you for you too look at. I think if they were to be considered you would agree that these 2 companies make superior LED products. That was the only question on the lights.

In regards to the warning system of the four vehicles, the installation of the Federal Signal, Soundoff Signal, 911 EP or the Code 3 system is acceptable. It will require the same scope of work regarding the electrical system and to ensure that the manufactures warranty is voided. In reference to a pilot vehicle, this would enable our law enforcement staff to evaluate the unit and identify any issues that they may have, providing there is no cost to the Bureau.  In the event there may be a cost associated with option, the Bureau would decline such an offer. 

Question #5

On the K9 unit would you consider an aluminum unit made by American aluminum products, we have found out that they are just as rugged but a lot lighter which could help with fuel mileage in the long run, and it dissipates heat a lot better than the steel one. And there will be no rust issues in the future.

In regards to the K9 cage, it has been determined that the use of the steel model is the only acceptable unit due to safety and standardization reasons.  

Question #6

On the cabinet, have you looked at a manufacture for your design? What are you currently using?

In regards to the truck vault, the unit from Odyssey is the preferred model to be used, providing standardization of our fleet

<p>Please see questions received and answers below:</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">1) Items 1-3 -&nbsp; We would need a drawing that defines where they want the "bends" in the cable.&nbsp; (These are apparently "formed" cables)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">2) On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> cables - Are there any applicable Mil Specs, performance specs, or environmental specs? &nbsp;&nbsp;What do they want the connector bodies to be made from... brass, stainless steel, etc. &nbsp;What's the desired plating on the connectors used on these cable assemblies?&nbsp; What plating is required on the connector contact pins (Silver? Gold? Etc.)? </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 10pt; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">3) On all connectors/adapters - What do they want the connector bodies to be made from... brass, stainless steel, etc. &nbsp;Are there any Mil, performance, or environmental specs? &nbsp;&nbsp;What's the desired plating on the connectors and the connector contact pins?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">Answers:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">The answer for question #1 is the cables are to be straight; there are no bends to be put in the cables. The cable (RG402FL) that is specified is a re-shapeable or flexible semi-rigid cable. We would like the cables to be straight so that we can bend them as necessary.
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;Q</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">uestions #2 and 3 there are no Mil Specs expected just the commercial RG specifications on the cable. Connectors should be crimp type for cables and adapters should be good commercial grade. Connector bodies can be nickel plated brass and as for center pins they can be gold or silver plated, gold is preferred.</span></p>

<DESC><p>************* RFI ADDENDA (JUST A COMMENT, REALLY) ***************</p>
<p>Recently, we've been getting a lot of great questions about our plans for the system, or technical constraints, and our ultimate acquisition strategy.  The thing of it is, we really don't know any of this stuff.  Oh, sure, our CTO knows what we currently own and has a good sense of our overall storage requirements now (and presumably) going into the immediate future.  But we lack sufficient knowledge of the various hardware options out there to make even a blind sketch of a decision tree, let alone start chopping off stray limbs.</p>
<p>That's why we're doing an RFI. We're trying to gather information in order to begin to piece together our bid requirements and an appropriate budget.&nbsp; We want to know what manufacturers have to offer and what it can do.  Only you can help us do this.</p>
<p>Again,  I wish to stress that this is an RFI, not an RFP.  We're soliciting information about the product line you (and your competitors) carry, the various features, costs, and configurations.&nbsp; We are precisely NOT dictating any particular &lsquo;best fit' approach so we can better understand what the industry presently offers and where it seems to be going.  This will help our CTO budget out our ultimate acquisition as well as figure out the initial strategy that seems best for our immediate plans. We are researching now, not shopping.</p>
<p>So we welcome questions, but have little idea how to address those which seem to require us to make a decision about a specific set of solutions or configurations, simply because we feel we lack sufficient familiarity with the present state of the art to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>These questions are valuable.  They should certainly be addressed.  However, I humbly submit that you are in the best position to do so.  Ask the questions, help us understand why the concerns they explore are important, and then tell us what you think the consequences are to us of answering them in different ways. Certainly we would wish to build a solicitation around clearly-defined constraints.  Please help us understand, from your perspective, what these are and how the system(s) you have to offer are equipped to manage them.</p>
<p>We appreciate the level of engagement we have seen to date and are excited and hopeful that we will reap a good deal of quality information from the RFI process. We welcome your ideas and expertise and look forward to considering the fruits of your responses.&nbsp; Please be reassured that so long as you e-mail your response to me in the format requested by the RFI attachment (see p. 2, "Response and Compliance Matrix," a format which is not all that restrictive and even includes a catch-all category in item #5), you can't get this wrong!</p>

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The Call for Fire Trainer (CFFT) program is conducting an analysis of image generators to determine if we should 1) continue delivering CFFT systems with the current image generators, 2) if we should integrate a new image generator into the CFFT systems that have not been delivered, or 3) if we should purchase new image generators for all CFFT systems.  The analysis will focus on 1) the capabilities of the image generator today, 2) what functionality would need to be developed to meet the program requirements, and 3) cost.  The result of the analysis will be a decision on which approach to take with the CFFT image generators and which products would best meet the requirements of the CFFT program.  If it is decided to integrate new image generators into the CFFT systems, the integration would start in October/November 2009.<BR><BR>The total number of CFFT systems to be delivered is approximately 405.  Of the 405 total systems, approximately 155 systems have been delivered to date.  These systems are delivered in 1-to-4, 1-to-12, and 1-to-30 (instructor-to-student) configurations.  The 1-to-4 and 1-to-12 configurations require 3 image generators.  The 1-to-30 configurations require 4 image generators.  <BR><BR>For the 1-to-4 and 1-to-12 configurations, an image generator is required for the enhanced student station which provides Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR) and Night Vision Goggles (NVG) views; a second image generator for the Stealth system at the Instructor Operators Station; and the third image generator for the rendered real-world scene projected on a classroom screen.  The 1-to-30 configuration has an additional image generator for additional field-of-view on the classroom screen to accommodate the larger student number.<BR><BR>The key parameters that will determine the approach the program takes are the following:<BR>"	Low cost visual system<BR>"	Reduce Life Cycle cost<BR>"	Leverage SE CORE database generation and models<BR>"	Compliance to the JFPL Standards<BR>"	Integration schedule compliance<BR><BR><BR>ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government anticipates that the program requirement will be fulfilled via a delivery order under PEO STRIs STOC II contract in accordance with FAR Part 16.505.  The Government will make the award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis.  <BR><BR>The contract type has not been determined at this time.<BR><BR>QUANTITIES: There will be 33 1-to-30 configurations delivered; the remaining systems will be 1-to-4 and 1-to-12 for a maximum total of 1,248 Image Generators.<BR><BR>ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE: Maximum of $12M<BR><BR>RESPONSES REQUIRED: STOC II contractors desiring to be considered for this opportunity must respond by the closing date above to the contract specialist listed below.  The Government reserves the right to eliminate STOC II contractors that fail to respond by the closing date above from further consideration for potential award.  <BR> <BR>Written responses to this announcement should consist of the following:<BR><BR>a.	Completed Vendor IG Response Table. (Attachment A below)<BR>b.	A statement as to whether the firm has the resource capacity to produce and deliver the image generator quantities through fiscal year 2015.<BR><BR>The response is limited to paragraphs a-b above and should not exceed six (6) pages.  Any additional information will be discarded without review.   The information provided needs to define the current functionality/capabilities of the product that you would recommend to this program.  At this time no cost information is being requested.  A point of contact for the CFFT team can speak to concerning your product and costing of the product is requested.<BR> <BR>It is requested that written responses be submitted as an attached Microsoft Word document no later than 3:30PM EST via email to adam.baldwin@us.army.mil on or before May 29, 2009.  <BR><BR>This Sources Sought is being posted on both the PEO STRI Business Opportunities Portal (STRI BOP) and to the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI).  If responses are received from STOC II contractors only, the Government reserves the right to follow STOC II Request For Proposal procedures as outlined in the STOC II User Guide if and when the RFP becomes necessary.<BR><BR>Written questions may be submitted by electronic mail to the technical point of contact below specified below.  The Government requires that all questions be received by 4:00 p.m. EST on 15 May 2009. Once all responses are completed, they will be disseminated via amendment to this Sources Sought. <BR><BR>NOTICE: STOC II contractors are advised that the Government may use a streamlined, multi phase process or evaluation factors in accordance with FAR Part 16 to determine if contractors will proceed to the next stage, and ultimately submitting an offer to be considered for award.<BR> <BR>DISCLAIMER: This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products. <BR><BR>Contracts POC: Adam Baldwin, (407)-208-3342, Adam.Baldwin1@us.army.mil		<BR>Technical POC: Jill Ashby, (407) 384-3854, Jill.Ashby@us.army.mil<BR><BR>UPDATE - 18 May 2009<BR><BR>Questions and Responses on the Image Generation and Analysis Sources Sought #1<BR><BR><BR>Question:  Could I please receive some clarification on Compliance to the JFPL Standards?<BR>Response:  The following is the JFPL Approach:<BR>"	JFPL architecture is a requirement-down, component-up approach to a family-of-systems architecture<BR>"	Product Line Attributes for all Joint Fires requirements are captured, decomposed and allocated to Functional Capabilities<BR>"	Functional Capabilities are mapped to JFPL Systems and further decomposed into Subsystems and Components<BR>"	To define a product, requirements flow down from the Product Line Attributes to Functional Capabilities, these are then matched to specifics in the System and Subsystem level to determine which JFPL components and fidelity are required for the specific configuration of JFPL product<BR>When the CFFT II team was asked what JFPL compliance would mean to an image generator, they provided the following 'need' which is in the Response table:  Capable of being controlled by a framework that determines if the IG scene is rendered on the entire screen or only a portion of the screen. For more information on JFPL and to request a copy of the Standards, contact Mr. Glen Loupe at: glen.loupe@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>Question:  In regards to PEO STRI's potential requirement for image generation analysis and solutions for the CFFT.  I was just curious if this was new work that PEO STRI was looking for or whether a contractor in the past had been fulfilling this.  Do you know if any previous contracts existed to provide this work?  <BR>Response:  Based on the information received in response to this RFI and potential discussions with vendors and programs using different image generators, an image generation analysis will be conducted for CFFT.  This analysis will be conducted in-house by PEO STRI Government employees.  No contract is contemplated for the analysis.  At the completion of the analysis, a recommendation will be provided to the CFFT program manager who may or may not decide to procure image generators based on the analysis.<BR><BR>Question:  What is the current IG being used?  <BR>Response:   FidView by Fidelity Technologies Corporation.  FidView is based on Tiltan of Israel.<BR><BR>Question:  What is the database format that it uses?<BR>Response:   FidView uses a unique format specific to the image generator.<BR><BR>Question:  Who is building the databases for this training device?<BR>Response:  Current databases have been built by Fidelity.<BR><BR>Question:  Do you envision this new IG being able to utilize CDB?<BR>Response:  No.  <BR><BR>Question:   Does the trainer currently use the SE Core products?<BR>Response:  CFFT does not currently use the SE Core products, but the requirement to use the SE Core products is part of Increment II.<BR>Question:  Can you tell me what CIGI 3.0 with JFPL prototype extensions is and point me to the specification?<BR>Response:  The document defines parameters/controls for the JFPL prototype that were not included in CIGI 3.0.  The prototype extensions include controls for entities, simulated military equipment, reticles, lights, decals and craters.  Because of potential sensitive material in the document we cannot attach the document to this announcement.<BR><BR>Question:  It was not clear to me but are we supposed to provide pricing in the a, b documents?<BR>Response:  No pricing is requested at this time.  After reviewing the responses to the table (a) and the statement request in (b), a request for information in accordance with the STOC II Guide may be requested  which may include a request for pricing.<BR><BR>Question:  How many customer references do you need?<BR>Response:  Preferably no more than 10.  The customer references should be for customers and systems that have purchased and used the same image generation configuration that is discussed in the table.<BR><BR>Question:  Are our answers kept confidential from other vendors?<BR>Response:   The answers to questions on the Sources Sought will be posted on the STRIBOP and FedBizOpps.  The responses you provide in the Vendor Table will be kept confidential if you so request.  <BR><BR>Question:  The 3-page response and the ImageGenerationVendorResponseTable.docmust both be submitted on the 29th of May, correct?<BR>Response:  Since the Vendor Response Table requested that several capabilities be discussed, it is anticipated that the number of pages for the table would grow from 3 to no more than 6 (to encourage brief discussions).  The statement as to whether the firm has the resource capacity to produce and deliver the image generator quantities through fiscal year 2015 can be provided at the start or end of the table, just so long as it is part of the 6 pages.  The response is due 29 May.<BR><BR>Question:   Google produces no results for CIGI 3.0 JFPL extensions. Is this a new specification?  Will it be made public by the CIGI review board or is it intended for custom applications?   There appears to be no public record of this specification.<BR>Response:  At this time there is no public record of the JFPL extensions.  CIGI 3.0 should still be available on line.  The extensions were to be submitted to the CIGI review board, but they have not been submitted yet.  The prototype extensions include controls for entities, simulated military equipment, reticles, lights, decals and craters.  Because of potential sensitive material in the document we cannot attach the document to this announcement.<BR><BR>Question:    If you choose to keep using the existing IG would you consider allowing customers to request other IGs as an option if the IG vendor would pay for all of its own integration costs into the CFFT device?<BR>Response:  That would be a program management decision.<BR><BR>Question:    Is there any consideration given to IG's that have already been integrated and used in the CFFT trainer?<BR>Response:  The image generation analysis will be conducted using the responses to this Sources Sought.  <BR><BR>Question:  Is source code required for the IG to be delivered to the program or escrow with the government or are commercial products acceptable?<BR>Response:  Commercial products are acceptable.<BR><BR>Question:   Can you consider having a competitive fly off with actual artillery or JTAC operators evaluating the candidate IG's<BR>Response:   At this time there is a Sources Sought only.  STOC II procedures will be followed for any further actions. <BR><BR>Question:  Do your IG estimates account for replacing the existing IG's should you choose another system?  It did not appear as if your calculations for the total estimated IG's accounted for replacing the existing systems should you choose a new IG vendor.<BR>Response:    According to the information received from the CFFT team, they have a current commitment to deliver a total of 405 systems.  Approximately 155 systems have already been delivered.  Of the 405 systems, 33 systems have 4 image generators each, and the remaining 372 systems have 3 image generators each.  According to my calculations, that would equal 1,248 image generators.  <BR><BR>Question:  What is the current price of the existing CFFT IG per unit?   Does this include all labor costs to make extensions?<BR>Response:   Cannot provide the information.<BR><BR>Question:   Does your existing IG charge for maintenance?  If not, how are modifications, extensions etc then paid for?   Are they done at no charge by the IG vendor for the life of the product or do you pay direct labor for such enhancements?<BR>Response:   CFFT is maintained under the Warfighter Focus contract.<BR><BR>Question:  Can you tell us the per unit IG cost in terms of percentage additional cost that you pay for new features?<BR>Response:   Cannot provide the information.<BR><BR>Question:  Would you consider a fixed annual maintenance fee to provide unlimited enhancements to the product?<BR>Response:  Not at this time.  This is a sources sought only.<BR><BR>Question:   Does the number of fielded units make any difference in the assessment?<BR>Response:  No.  The number of different customers/programs and their appraisal of your product will be taken into consideration as part of the analysis.<BR><BR>Question:   What is the current installed base of the current IG?   Is the current CFFT IG used outside the program?<BR>Response:  Do not know.<BR><BR> Question:  Where can we read about the current IG on the internet?  Is there a published list of its capabilities?<BR>Responses:  We have not found any information on the current IG on the internet.  We are not aware of a published list of its capabilities.  For this analysis, the evaluators are using knowledge gained from involvement with other close-air-support systems to understand what IG capabilities are needed and the Increment II requirements provided by the CFFT team.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding the Operating System, is a cross-platform solution required?<BR>Response:   Yes.<BR><BR>Question:   Regarding CIGI 3.0 with JFPL extensions, where can references to these extensions be found?  Please expand the JFPL acronym.  <BR>Response:  The document defines parameters/controls for the JFPL prototype that were not included in CIGI 3.0.   The prototype extensions include controls for entities, simulated military equipment, reticles, lights, decals and craters.  Because of potential sensitive material in the document we cannot attach the document to this announcement.  JFPL is an acronym for Joint Fires Product Line.<BR><BR>Question:  What is meant by being JFPL architecture compliant?<BR>Response:  The following is the JFPL Approach:<BR>"	JFPL architecture is a requirement-down, component-up approach to a family-of-systems architecture<BR>"	Product Line Attributes for all Joint Fires requirements are captured, decomposed and allocated to Functional Capabilities<BR>"	Functional Capabilities are mapped to JFPL Systems and further decomposed into Subsystems and Components<BR>"	To define a product, requirements flow down from the Product Line Attributes to Functional Capabilities, these are then matched to specifics in the System and Subsystem level to determine which JFPL components and fidelity are required for the specific configuration of JFPL product<BR>When the CFFT II team was asked what JFPL compliance would mean to an image generator, they provided the following 'need' which is in the Response table:  Capable of being controlled by a framework that determines if the IG scene is rendered on the entire screen or only a portion of the screen. For more information on JFPL and to request a copy of the Standards, contact Mr. Glen Loupe at: glen.loupe@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding Remote Activation/Deactivation, how remote is this requirement?  From a directly connected host?  From somewhere else on the simulation network? Etc.  Please define remote.  <BR>Response:  Activation/deactivation using the host or instructor station application software on the simulation network.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding Remote Activation/Deactivation, does the remote activation function imply that the system needs to be able to join an in-progress simulation/exercise?<BR>Response:  Yes.<BR><BR>Question:  Does Remote Activation/Deactivation imply power on/off?  Or does it mean to put the monitor in wakeup/stand-by modes?<BR>Response:   Yes.  Remote activation/deactivation does include power on/off powered via wake-on LAN.<BR><BR>Question:  Under the IG Functionality section, what is meant by IG Software Label?<BR>Response:  The product name of your image generator.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding Adjustable Gamma, under what conditions is this functionality needed?  Is this mostly a tuning function?<BR>Response:  Yes, the adjustable gamma is mostly a tuning function, primarily for sensor simulation.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding # of Transparencies Supported, what is the intent?  Is the request to identify the levels of translucency (i.e. 16, 64, 256, etc.) or the types of translucency (i.e. screen-door, contour, etc.)?<BR>Response:   The request is to identify the levels of translucency.  Any additional information you want to provide, as long as it fits within the 6 pages, will be reviewed..<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding the Symbology capability, what are the driving requirements?  For example, is it desirable for symbology to be a video overlay?  Is it desirable for symbology to be a part of the rendered scene?  <BR>Response:    Symbology is required to simulate the military equipment that is included with the CFFT.  Currently the CFFT includes simulated Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR), Night Vision Goggles (NVG), and binoculars with reticle.  For this simulated military equipment the symbology is part of the rendered scene.<BR><BR>Question:  Is the symbology expected to be controlled via CIGI?  Is a separate symbology API desired?<BR>Response:  Yes, it is expected for the symbology to be controlled via CIGI.  The JFPL extensions include controls for the current simulated military equipment.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding the ephemeris model, is an accurate earth curvature horizon depression required?  How critical is the start field alignment?<BR>Response:  A realistic looking earth curvature horizon depression is required.  The sky should include correctly sized stars, but star field alignment is not a requirement.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding the illuminating light sources, what types of lighting are required (i.e. Per-pixel, Per-vertex, light maps, static/dynamic, shadow-casting, etc)?<BR>Response:  Image generators are frequently configured to match the requirements of the customer and the cost.  For the image generator configuration that you would propose for the CFFT - keeping in mind that the image generators are used to render the simulated military equipment scene, the stealth scene, and a single projector and a key parameter is low cost visual system - what features in the database would have illuminating lights? <BR><BR>Question:    Regarding illumination flares, what is meant by complexity of the visible screen?  Does complexity in this sense imply glare, shadows, and similar advanced effects?<BR>Response:  Complexity of the visible screen is asking for a description of the rendered scene.  For example, we support 10 simultaneous flares with a desert scene, no features and no moving models; or, we support 4 simultaneous flares in a flat urban area with 50 geo-typical buildings, light tree scatter and 10 models moving.  Your description can also include advanced effects.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding the support for ground clamping of models, are multiple ground clamping modes required (i.e. rigid body, dynamics model, etc.)?<BR>Response:  No.<BR><BR>Question:  Regarding the screen control framework, does this imply that the IG will not own the display (i.e. not full-screen mode)?<BR>Response:  Yes, that is correct.  <BR><BR>Question:  Does PEO STRI anticipate a short term future demo, is a prototype desired with the study, or is it merely focusing on an analytic study with estimated costs?<BR>Response:  No demonstration or prototype is anticipated, neither time nor money will allow this approach.  The analysis will be conducted using the information received from the Sources Sought and possible discussions with vendors.<BR><BR>Question:   Does PEO STRI anticipate integration of a system in Oct/Nov or development starting then followed by integration.<BR>Response:  We anticipate integration of a production image generator into the CFFT systems starting Oct/Nov.<BR><BR>UPDATE - 21 May 2009<BR><BR>Questions and Responses for the IG Analysis Sources Sought #2<BR><BR>Question:  How many of the total 1248 total IGs are in the 155 installed systems (out of the 405 total systems)?<BR>Response:   29 1-to-30 configurations were included in the 155 for 116 IGs.  The other 126 systems out of the 155 installed systems included 3 IGs for 378 IGs.  Therefore the total was 494 IGs for the 155 installed systems.<BR><BR>Question:  The projected cost is estimated at $12M.  Does this cover the existent IGs plus the new IGs, or is this cost only associated with the new IGs (if a new IG is selected based upon performance and cost parameters)?<BR>Response:  The $12M is a ROM for new IGs for all systems - existing delivered systems and systems schedule to be delivered.<BR><BR>Question:  Does the solution space just include IGs, the IG systems (IGs, projectors, and geometry correction systems), or possibly other components in addition to the prior mentioned hardware to support the CFFT systems?<BR>Response:  The analysis is for IGs only.<BR><BR>Question:   Is the new IG system required to utilize the terrain DBs current in use in the 155 installed systems or are SE Core compliant terrains a part of this solicitation?<BR>Response:  A requirement of Increment II for the CFFT is the capability to use SE Core developed databases.<BR><BR>Question:   What NVG solutions are currently in use?<BR>Response:  Simulated night vision goggles are presented on the Enhanced Student station.  The simulation is not specific to a particular real-world NVG but provides a rendered scene that would be representative of Gen 2 NVGs.<BR><BR>Question:   What LLDR solutions are currently in use?<BR>Response:  The simulated LLDR is presented on the Enhanced Student station.  The simulation provides the same capabilities as the current Army version of the LLDR.<BR><BR>Question:   Could you provide a Use Case explanation of how the current system is typically used?<BR>Response:  Descriptions of the CFFT system are provided on the internet by both Fidelity Technologies Corporation and PEO STRI.  <BR><BR>Question:    In terms of NVG views, what level of radiometric fidelity does this system require?<BR>Response:   CFFT does not have a published radiometric fidelity requirement.<BR><BR>Question:   If the decision is made to upgrade the existing, fielded systems, does the government anticipate upgrading both the hardware and software, or just the software?  If software only, can you provide hardware specs for the fielded systems?<BR>Response:  The Government anticipates upgrading both the hardware and software if the decision is made to upgrade the existing fielded systems.<BR><BR>Question:  Does the hardware have any special physical configuration requirements (e.g. rack-mounted)?<BR>Response:  Currently, the CFFT configurations include rack mounted, desktop, and laptop IGs. <BR><BR>Question:  What is meant by types of shading supported in the Vendor Response Table?<BR>Response:  Examples would be:  flat, fixed, Gouraud, and Phong.<BR><BR>Question:   The vendor IG response table includes Genlock capability, yet the system configuration descriptions seem to indicate multiple, individual displays.  Please explain.<BR>Response:  True.  The one exception is the 1-to-30 configuration which uses 2 projectors and 2 IGs for the rendered scene on a large screen at the front of the classroom.<BR><BR>Question:   When is the anticipated completion date for the integration of new IGs which starts in Oct/Nov 09?<BR>Response:  After integrating the first new IG into the system, integration should be completed in approximately one week for all systems at each site.

<DESC>This notice is a solicitation for offers. The method of procurement is Full & Open Competition with no restrictions. This requirement will be awarded as a Design-Build, firm fixed price contract.

Proposals are due by 2:00pm Eastern Standard Time on Monday, June 22, 2009.

The United States General Services Administration has a requirement for a firm to provide all labor, material, equipment, and supervision necessary for the design and construction of a new modified built-up roofing system and a photovoltaic array at the Veterans Affairs Center, located at 5000 Wissahickon Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19144. The project duration, including design and construction, will be 240 calendar days.

The new roofing system shall consist of three membrane layers with a cap sheet having encapsulated white granules. The membranes and cap sheet shall be torch applied. The photovoltaic array shall consist of ballasted, crystalline panels. The existing roof is flat, 10 years old, and the entire roof area is approximately 133,000 square feet. The roof is currently in poor condition with some portions of the roof leaking. 

The successful firm must have relevant past experience working on projects of a similar scope. Relevant experience includes roof and photovoltaic array installations of a similar size and complexity. The successful contractor must also have qualified project personnel who have experience with projects of a similar scope.

A pre-proposal conference will be held on Monday, June 1, 2009 at 9:30AM at the Veteran's Affairs Center, 5000 Wissahickon Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19144. This will be the only pre-proposal meeting. Participation is encouraged although attendance is not mandatory.  The conference will provide an opportunity for discussion of the nature of the work as well as to answer questions concerning contract provisions and requirements, including drawings and specifications.  Parking inside the Veteran’s Affairs complex is limited and attendees may be required to park on the street. The meeting will begin promptly at 9:30AM. Attendees are asked to assemble in the lobby of the main entrance no later than 9:30AM. The pre-proposal meeting will include access to the roof.

1. Relevant Past Performance
2. Key Personnel Qualifications
3. Small Business Subcontracting Plan

For evaluation purposes, Key Personnel Qualifications is slightly less important than Past Performance. Small Business Subcontracting Plan is significantly less important than Key Personnel Qualifications.

IAW FAR 15.305, offers from small business concerns will receive the highest rating for the small business subcontracting plan evaluation factor. Separate technical and price proposals will be required. Further information regarding the requirement and the evaluation process are contained in the solicitation package available for download.

The estimated price range for this requirement is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00

Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, award will be made using best-value, source-selection procedures incorporating tradeoffs between price-related and non-price related factors. Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the best value to the Government based on a combination of technical and price factors. For evaluation purposes, technical factors when combined, are approximately equal to price. Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer will preclude further participation on this acquisition. 

The NAICS code applicable to this project is 238160. This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.

<DESC><p>TAS::57 3404::TAS ARRA XUMU 95-1041C, Construct Storage at Fire Station1, fully funded by Recovery Act.
<p>Work efforts for this project will construct a new storage facility for the Fire Station 1 at VAFB, CA. The area along the Northeast side of building 1740 will be modified to provide a more functional storage unit and court yard area. The work will include removal of miscellaneous items in the area including the cooking grill and benches. The temporary storage building will be moved to another location at the fire station. The area will be cleared and all vegetation removed. The existing sprinkler system in the area will be removed and a new sprinkler system will be installed once the new structures are in place. The existing concrete slabs at the courtyard area will also be removed. The concrete located under the generator will remain in place but a section will be cut and removed to make way for the masonry walls. In addition, the existing concrete walkway will be removed as required to allow for the new structures. A new storage facility will be constructed using 8" x 8" x 16" smooth faced CMU. The storage facility will be 20' x 20 x 13'-10" tall. The block walls will be solid grouted, steel reinforced and placed atop a substantial steel reinforced concrete footing and slab on grade. The slab will be 6" thick and steel reinforced. A 10' wide x 8' high metal roll up door will be installed on the east facing wall of the new structure. The existing irrigation system will be modified to accommodate the construction described above. New lighting will be sufficient to illuminate entire storage room. Concrete walkways and courtyards will be placed. A double barbeque pit will be constructed and the pit walls will be solid grouted, steel reinforced and placed atop a substantial steel reinforced concrete footing.</p>

<p><br />I. Contracting Organization</p>
<p>U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Philips Research Site, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico <br />87117-5773. Contracting Officer: Ms Barbara Steinbock. Contract Number FA9451-09-C-0350.</p>
<p>II. Description of Action</p>
<p>This acquisition is to temporarily provide an advanced, dynamic, singlet oxygen generator (SOG) that can provide a primary reactive zone in the SOG using aqueous mixed-base hydrogen peroxide (MHP) jets and a secondary reactive zone in the SOG using colder aqueous basic hydrogen peroxide (BHP) jets. The SOG should have a catch tank that can maintain separate degassing zones for each of the flow zones described with minimal cross-contamination between the two flow zones. The SOG must have injector orifice plates traceable to the current ABL SOG design and be capable of incorporating inlet reactive gas cross flows on the order of 3 - 5 moles/second. The SOG should also be completely dynamic in terms of being able to change the injection angles of the MHP and BHP flows, the location of the liquid layer at the bottom of the SOG, the location of the exit gas flow from the SOG, placement of gas/liquid separator vanes at the exit of the SOG, and the placement of internal SOG plates that will minimize pooling of MHP/BHP internally in the SOG and minimize any liquid streaming out of the SOG exit during the application of gas cross flow through the SOG. The SOG must also be able to incorporate enhanced orifice injector plate designs into the aqueous inlet regions of the SOG. In addition, there must be existing data from the dynamic SOG described above that indicates that it has stable jet operation in the two flow zones (primary and secondary) when operating at SOG pressures greater than 120 Torr and with gas cross flow velocities greater than 25 meters/second. Also, the SOG must be capable of using high mass flux cross flows that use chlorine gas. The SOG must be transportable, and be able to easily integrate into the Air Force Research Lab's Advanced COIL Test Stand (ACTS), located at Kirtland, AFB, New Mexico. The contractor should also be available to support integration of the SOG into the ACTS and be able to support laser tests using this advanced SOG as needed. STI Optronics, Bellevue, WA is the only known source based on their proprietary control of the underlying technology.<br /><br />III. Description of Supplies/Services</p>
<p>Procure actively Enhanced Mass Flux Singlet Oxygen Generator (EMF SOG) with water vapor control (WVC) for reduced weight COIL.</p>
<p><br />IV. Authority</p>
<p>10 USC 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)</p>
<p><br />V. Applicability of Authority</p>
<p>STI Optronics designed the initial performance parameters of the enhanced mass flux SOG with water vapor control. As the only source, AFRL required STI's capability and their EMFSOG for integration into our well-characterized advanced COIL Test Stand (ACTS). This authority is applicable as we are continuing to develop our COIL requirements.</p>
<p>VI.Efforts to Obtain Competition - A synopsis was posted 20 Feb 09 and no responses were received. AFRL will continue to look for sources to enhance competition.</p>
<p><br />VII. Fair and Reasonable Costs</p>
<p>Based on the evaluation provided by the project officer in his experience in this area, a determination of fair and reasonable can be determined.</p>
<p>VIII. Market Research</p>
<p>A synopsis was posted in the FedBizOps on 20 Feb 09. There were no responses to this synopsis.</p>
<p>IX. Other Facts - N/A</p>
<p>X. Interested Sources - N/A</p>
<p><br />XI. Steps to Foster Competition</p>
<p>If future purchases are required, all attempts will be made to attract competition.</p>
<p><br />XII. Contracting Officer's Certification</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's signature on the Justification Review Document evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>XIII. Technical/Requirements Personnel's Certification</p>
<p>As evidenced by their signatures on the Justification Review Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility is both accurate and complete.</p>
