This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a source
control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of
DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing
knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor
qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the
intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected
items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that
required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be
economically obtained. The subject item requires Government source approval
prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical
data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full
and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government
for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new
source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a
new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with
your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems
Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares:
www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures
identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's
experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you
have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being
evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which
forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to
provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous
submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be
considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a
source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or
approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to
meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue
based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification
Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx".

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District will be issuing an Invitation for Bids for Maintenance Dredging of the Federal Navigation Project (FNP) in Duxbury Harbor, Duxbury, MA. This will be an unrestricted competitive requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The estimated construction cost is expected to range from $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00. <br>  <br> The work of this project consists of maintenance dredging of the FNP which consists of an, 8 feet deep, 100 feet wide and 1 mile long, entrance channel; and, an 8 feet deep, 21 acre anchorage in the inner harbor. A total of about 200,000 cubic yards (c.y.) of predominantly silt-clay will be dredged by mechanical dredge. A closed bucket will be required while dredging in the silty material to minimize turbidity adjacent to the dredge. The dredged sediment will be transported to, and placed at, the Cape Cod Bay Disposal Site (CCBDS) located approximately 20 nautical miles (one-way) from Duxbury Harbor. The anticipated work window is September 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015. Due to environmental concerns, the CCBDS closes on January 1, 2016; therefore, all work in this contract will be required to be completed by that date. Under this contract the successful offeror will be required to provide the equipment, personnel and materials required for the removal of about 200,000 cy of material as described herein from the FNP and placement of the dredged material at the CCBDS within the specified timeframe.  Given the project constraints, it is estimated that the contractor will need to meet or exceed a production rate of about 75,000 cubic yards per month to successfully complete the project within the performance period.   <br>  <br> It is the Government's intent to contract this work to an offeror who can demonstrate a production rate (i.e. dredging and dredged material disposal) of at least 75,000 cy per month via mechanical dredging and disposal at an open ocean disposal area on at least one project in the past five years.  This requirement will be included in the solicitation as a definitive responsibility criterion, to be demonstrated by the low bidder following the bid opening and prior award. <br>  <br> This is not a request for proposals at this time. The solicitation requirements, contract documents (to include instructions for submission and definitive responsibility criterion) and the response date will be available on or about May 28, 2015.  Neither telephonic, mailed nor fax requests for hard copies will be accepted. The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation, offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (http:/www.fbo.gov). Amendments, if any, to the solicitation will be made available at the http:/www/fbo.gov website. Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the FedBizOps Registration List. All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at Stephen.e.Jones@usace.army.mil. <br>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION	<br />This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a small business social-economic set-aside, competitive or non-competitive method is possible, and to determine the availability of all qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is  541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services with associated business size standard $15,000,000.00.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />The Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience (LBN) in the the National Institute on Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is driven to conduct basic and clinical research on individual differences in cognition, personality, and affect; Investigate the neural contributions to these individual differences; Investigate the influence of age on these traits and states and their reciprocal influence on cognitive and mental health, well-being, and adaptation; Examine predictors and modifiers of age-related neurodegenerative diseases and age-associated changes in behavior, predispositions, and brain-behavior associations; and Identify early markers of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline, and examines factors that promote the maintenance of cognitive health.</p>
<p>The Unit of Clinical &amp; Translational Neuroscience in the LBN seeks to identify novel biomarkers that might be predictive of disease before the onset of clinical symptoms, by applying mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics for the discovery of novel biomarkers predictive of disease before symptom onset; and relating genetic and environmental risk factors to changes in brain structure, function and pathology during aging. In the biomarker discovery studies, the Unit of Clinical &amp; Translational Neuroscience uses archived blood samples collected through the existing research study project, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA), to identify changes over time in the concentrations of proteins and small metabolites that may be predictive of early cognitive decline and neuropathological changes associated with AD.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to determine eligible sources with the capability and experience in performing Integrated Machine learning analyses of Metabolomic, Proteomic and Longitudinal Clinical Variables for Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease. The purpose of this potential requirement is for the contractor to perform advanced machine learning analyses on measurements (metabolomics and proteomics) obtained from blood and brain tissue samples as well as longitudinal clinical/laboratory data collected from participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). The final objective is the identification of predictive biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and enhanced understanding of the molecular bases of cognitive resilience/susceptibility to Alzheimer's pathology. Contractor shall indentify their ability to perform integrated machine-learning analyses on high-dimensional metabolomic, proteomic, and longitudinal clinical data for the identification of Predictive biomarkers of AD and Molecular markers associated with resilience and susceptibility to AD pathology.<br /> <br />In general, the contractor shall be required to use machine-learning methods that allow uncovering of relationships between the following requirements described in this Small Business Sources Sought notice. Contractor shall be required to provide a detailed analysis of results in a Microsoft Word document and formal written progress reports on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>1. Longitudinal changes in serum concentrations of small molecule metabolites and risk of incident AD using global metabolomic profiling as well as targeted metabolomics datasets on approximately 600 serum samples from the BLSA.</p>
<p>2. Metabolomic markers (using both targeted and untargeted metabolomics datasets) of resilience/vulnerability to AD pathology. These data are acquired on approximately 45 brain samples (BLSA autopsy study) from three brain regions.</p>
<p>3. Proteomic markers (using untargeted proteomics data) of resilience/vulnerability to AD pathology. These data are acquired on approximately 45 brain samples (BLSA autopsy study) from two brain regions.</p>
<p>4. Longitudinal clinical/laboratory data and risk of incident AD. These analyses will be performed on longitudinal clinical/laboratory data collected in the BLSA and &lsquo;Biomarkers of Cognitive Decline Among Normal Individuals' (BIOCARD) studies.</p>
<p>5. Final analyses will examine the utility of combining longitudinal metabolomic and clinical/laboratory data for understanding mechanisms of AD pathogenesis and prediction of AD risk.</p>
<p>The Government will provide datasets containing data matrices of sample data in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to the contractor for analysis. The primary place of performance of contractor analysis is anticipated to be the contractor's place of business. The anticipated period of performance shall be effective on or around September 30, 2015 for a period of two years through September 29, 2017.<br /> <br />CAPABILITY STATEMENT / INFORMATION SOUGHT	<br />Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize itself with the requirements of this product or service and the type of information sought.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. This is a Request for Quote and the solicitation number is VA101-15-Q-0236. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51. This solicitation (see attached file) is targeting only Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). 
VA has a portfolio of over 1,900 operational leases, approximately 1,500 of which are direct (i.e. via GSA Delegation) leases.  Each year, VA replaces, renews, or enters into hundreds of leases, in addition to the exercising of options, entering into standstill agreements, and other similar lease actions.  Recent changes to GSA Delegation policy provides that VA must secure delegation on a project by project basis and make use of GSA's GREX delegation system to do so.  This process involves the preparation of lease packages for internal VA approval, upload of various documents to GSA's GREX system (including scoring), and ultimately execution of the lease contract once delegation is received.  This process must be completed in compliance with internal VA policy requirements, GSA delegation requirements, and OMB A-11 Appendix B requirements.
Additionally, CFM's workload includes land management activities: the acquisition, disposal, and modification of real estate interests, including fee simple, easements, licenses, permits, and outleasing.  These actions involve the preparation of internal approvals, obtaining and reviewing various due diligence studies and other deliverables, the closing/settlement process, and title review and approval according to Department of Justice (DOJ) standards.
The selected contractor shall be responsible for the following: using available systems and databases to track and report leases and land management actions; preparation of lease packages to ensure compliance with internal approval, GSA, and OMB A-11 requirements including documentation and communication of any identified deficiencies; documenting leasing and land management process flows, to include internal routing and external routing; documenting requirements in support of process flows, including checklists, cheat sheets, and FAQs; specific documentation and training material related to policies, procedures, design guides, and handbooks for leasing and land management; providing project management support services for leasing and land management activities; and general real estate program support.
CFM intends to acquire the services necessary to satisfy this requirement through limited competitive means - SDVOSB firms must complete 51 percent of the work.  The complete solicitation document file is attached. All questions should be emailed to maina.gakure@va.gov by September 2 (Noon EST) and a response to the questions will be posted as an amendment to the solicitation. The associated NAICS code is 531390 (Other activities related to real estate). This solicitation closes on Wednesday September 14, 2015 at 7:00 am (EST).  Point of contact is maina.gakure@va.gov or 202 461 6849. Interested contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and verified at www.vetbiz.
Please respond to the attached Task I PWS as well. To eliminate competitive advantage to other CFM lease related work, note the restrictions as listed at the last page of the RFQ

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District will be issuing an Invitation for Bids for Maintenance Dredging of the Federal Navigation Project (FNP) in Duxbury Harbor, Duxbury, MA. This will be an unrestricted competitive requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The estimated construction cost is expected to range from $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.  <br>    <br>  The work of this project consists of maintenance dredging of the FNP which consists of an, 8 feet deep, 100 feet wide and 1 mile long, entrance channel; and, an 8 feet deep, 21 acre anchorage in the inner harbor. A total of about 200,000 cubic yards (c.y.) of predominantly silt-clay will be dredged by mechanical dredge. A closed bucket will be required while dredging in the silty material to minimize turbidity adjacent to the dredge. The dredged sediment will be transported to, and placed at, the Cape Cod Bay Disposal Site (CCBDS) located approximately 20 nautical miles (one-way) from Duxbury Harbor. The anticipated work window is September 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015. Due to environmental concerns, the CCBDS closes on January 1, 2016; therefore, all work in this contract will be required to be completed by that date. Under this contract the successful offeror will be required to provide the equipment, personnel and materials required for the removal of about 200,000 cy of material as described herein from the FNP and placement of the dredged material at the CCBDS within the specified timeframe.  Given the project constraints, it is estimated that the contractor will need to meet or exceed a production rate of about 75,000 cubic yards per month to successfully complete the project within the performance period.    <br>    <br>  It is the Government's intent to contract this work to an offeror who can demonstrate a production rate (i.e. dredging and dredged material disposal) of at least 75,000 cy per month via mechanical dredging and disposal at an open ocean disposal area on at least one project in the past five years.  This requirement will be included in the solicitation as a definitive responsibility criterion, to be demonstrated by the low bidder following the bid opening and prior award.  <br>    <br>  This is not a request for proposals at this time. The solicitation requirements, contract documents (to include instructions for submission and definitive responsibility criterion) and the response date will be available on or about May 28, 2015.  Neither telephonic, mailed nor fax requests for hard copies will be accepted. The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation, offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (http:/www.fbo.gov). Amendments, if any, to the solicitation will be made available at the http:/www/fbo.gov website. Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the FedBizOps Registration List. All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at Stephen.e.Jones@usace.army.mil.  <br>
