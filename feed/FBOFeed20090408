<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR OCEANIC DATA LINK TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM/SERVICE.
This is a market survey for Oceanic Data Link (ODL) Telecommunications System/Service.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
In order to compete for this effort all interested parties must have an existing system that is fully capable of meeting the FAA's immediate requirements.
The ODL Telecommunications System/Service consists of routing and delivery of messages used in the provision of Air Traffic Control (ATC) services, which originate from and are addressed to FAA ATC automation systems.
This service must be provided to the New York, Oakland and Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC), the William J Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC).  The service supports Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP), Flight Data Processor (FDP2000) system, and Future Air Navigation System (FANS 1/A) aircraft.
The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing: Message Routing and Delivery service and Network Access for ODL Telecommunications System/Service.  Vendors must demonstrate that they have the following capabilities/knowledge:	Provide Hardware and Software equipment/infrastructure including satellite network service for an ODL Telecommunications service/system.	Engineering and Maintenance services for ODL equipment.	Provide technical support for Interface Testing of the ATOP and FDP2000 systems.	Knowledge of existing ODL FAA system.
The estimated value for this requirement is $3,000,000 to $5,000,000.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing ODL Telecommunications System/Service.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541990, with a size standard of $7.0 million.   
Attached is a draft of the statement of work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments. 
All pages for the submissions must conform to the following format: minimum 10 point font, 1 inch margins, single sided, no foldouts, and be on 8.5 X 11 size paper.
All responses to this market survey must be received by April 21, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time.  Responses may be hand delivered or sent via e-mail to:

<DESC>The AV8B's F402 engine utilizes a variable compressor inlet guide vane control system (EVICS) which incorporates a digital controller (IDEC). Hamilton Sunstrand developed and manufactures the EVICS System. The IDEC contains two control channels. Each channel performs fault detection functions as part of the its normal operation. When either IDEC channel detects a fault condition, it records the fault code along with diagnostic parameters in a section of non-volitile memory designated aa the fault code store. The IDEC also continuously broadcasts the values of a number of software variables through it serial data connection. The required software uploader fault downloader and data logger system is intended to communicate with the IDEC for the purpose of downloading fault codes and uploading software into non-volitile memory. The same equipment must be capable of monitoring, displaying, and recording all available parameters in the IDEC software in real-time while the EVICS system is operating. 

The EVICS system data is proprietary to Hamilton Sundstrand. The required item can not be provided without said propietary data.

NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement with International Transducer Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA 93111 for the purchase of twelve(12)ITC-8201C units which will be used as direct spare replacement units. In the event of part failure or malfunction during test operations, the OEM parts allow facility technicians to efficiently expedite repairs thereby reducing the cost to the Government resulting from the lost hours of facility operation and lost pro! ductivity hours for operations personnel. A firm-fixed price order is anticipated in accordance with FAR Part 13 procedures.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals or quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  However, all proposals or quotes received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to Synergies, National Inhalant Prevent Coalition, 322-A Thompson Street, Chattanooga, TN 37405.  The anticipated date of award is April 24, 2009.

The purpose of this contract is for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration/Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (SAMHSA/CSAT) to continue its partnership with the National Inhalant Prevention Coalition (NIPC) to provide support for an education campaign to alert the public about the dangers of inhalants.  SAMHSA/CSAT support will be provided to identify the latest research data on inhalants including what constitutes effective treatment from various experts which may include persons from pertinent Federal agencies, the faith community, foundations, medical groups, trade associations, poison control centers and other interested parties.  SAMHSA/CSAT support will enable the National Inhalant Prevention Coalition to hold a press conference in Washington to kick-off National Inhalants and Poisons Awareness Week in March 2010 and to stimulate media coverage of the dangers of inhalant use and abuse.

This contract addresses both programs and principles within the SAMHSA Matrix including substance abuse treatment capacity, prevention and early intervention, children and families.  The activity collaborates with public and private partners in the crosscutting Matrix domains by broadening consumer education options and treatment program information on the latest methodologies available to treat inhalant use problems.

SAMHSA/CSAT will also collaborate with NIPC as a co-sponsor of the kick-off press conference for National Inhalant and Poisons Awareness Week in March 2010.  Through the Washington, DC news conference and associated radio, television and Internet programming during the weeklong observance, SAMHSA/CSAT will gain an opportunity to help spotlight an effort that seeks to provide hope and help to youth and families suffering from inhalant abuse.  Press related activities will be coordinated with SAMHSAs Office of Communications.  This observance has garnered attention from the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Alliance for Chemical Dependency.

The National Inhalant Prevention Coalition (NIPC) was founded in 1992 by Synergies, a non-profit corporation.  NIPC is a public-private effort to promote awareness and recognition of the under-publicized problem of inhalant use and its deadly consequences.  NIPC is the only organization of its type with the contacts, know-how and dedication to combating inhalant abuse necessary to bring this project to fruition.

NIPC is an inhalant and information clearinghouse concerning inhalant related issues.  The Coalition generates media coverage, develops education and information materials, produces a quarterly newsletter, and provides training and technical assistance.  NIPC works with Federal, state and local government agencies, schools, businesses, trade associations, media, civic organizations, law enforcement, poison control centers, the medical community and interfaith groups throughout the country to develop awareness and prevention campaigns designed to educate youth and adults about the dangers of inhalants.  NIPC also provides in-service training for educators and maintains a web site on inhalants.  The National Inhalant Prevention Coalition created and continues National Inhalants & Poisons Awareness Week.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.

Federal buildings must be high-performance green facilities which demonstrate the merit of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, performance, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Integrated Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities must meet all Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements specifically the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. All projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific IBCLEED certification credits required.  The project will be in conformance to GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), International Building Code, Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS), and applicable customer agency requirements. The facility will be designed in metric units.  

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project as authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) is a two-phase major renovation project to modernize the building infrastructure systems and provide limited tenant improvements of the existing Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse campus, which was built in 1978.  Phase I includes $60-70 million for the design and construction for an electrical substation and  the existing 5-story U. S. Courthouse, which  is approximately 136,000 gross square feet (GSF). Phase II includes only the design for the existing 9-story federal building, which is approximately 600,000 gross square feet (GSF).  The $100-110 million Phase II construction funding is not part of the ARRA. 

The federal campus is located at 300 Ala Moana Boulevard in Honolulu, Hawaii. Currently, both buildings are fully occupied by federal agencies. The buildings include 6 artworks that will be conserved. This project will not only modernize the major building systems to provide 30+ years of useful life, but will also transform the existing buildings into high-performance green buildings, and provide an efficient and model interior work place for the existing federal tenants. While the project will not require alteration to the existing building exterior, the renovation project should enhance and be responsive to the distinct architectural statement of the existing buildings while improving the energy conservation, quality of the existing offices while showcase sustainable design. Currently, a window replacement project is underway that will provide blast protection for the courthouse building.  This project will be completed by June 2010.  The scope and extent of the window replacement project must be aligned with the project requirements outlined in this solicitation. 

The project consists of complete design services including the preparation of construction documents and construction administration services.  The construction will be phased utilizing internal swing space and the project delivery method will be CMc.


SCOPE OF WORK

The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for implementation of an integrative design process whereby the project design is developed in tandem by a multidisciplinary team through concept design, design development, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and building information modeling (BIM), and post-construction contract services (PCCS) for the complete renovation and modernization of both existing buildings.  The project  includes major renovations to several building infrastructure systems not limited to the HVAC, fire alarm, life safety, fire sprinkler, plumbing, security and electrical systems  The project will also include limited tenant improvements. Since the existing buildings are currently fully occupied, construction will be strategically phased while tenants will utilize swing spaces located within the buildings.

<CONTACT>Dawn Simpson, (503) 808-4607

<a href="mailto:dawn.r.simpson@usace.army.mil">Portland District, US Army Corps of Engineers</a>
<DESC>The Northwest Division, US Army Corps of Engineers (NWD, USACE) has developed and demonstrated a Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS) consisting of acoustic micro-transmitters (tags) and autonomous, cabled, and portable/mobile acoustic receivers for evaluating behavior and survival of juvenile salmonids migrating through the Columbia River Federal Power System (FCRPS).  Receivers have been deployed at large hydro-electric dams, free flowing sections of the FCRPS as well as the estuary of the Columbia River.  Self-contained autonomous receivers that detect, decode, and store decoded messages are typically deployed in areas within the Columbia River basin where a power source is not readily available and cable runs not feasible for a variety of reasons.  Cabled receivers detect, decode, and store decoded messages, time of arrival, and message waveforms as received on up to four hydrophones at large hydro-electric dams within the FCRPS.  Numbers of clusters form arrays that are time synchronized using time obtained from GPS receivers.  Cabled receivers are used for estimating route and time of passage including 2D and 3D position estimates for tagged fish.  Portable receivers detect, decode, store, and display transmitted signals for in laboratory transmitter testing and for displaying and entering transmitter codes at the time of tagging.  A mobile receiver consisting of a single 4 hydrophone cluster deployed from a single boat has been used to provide 2D and 3D position estimates on actively migrating tagged fish.  The USACE intends to award a multi-year (1 year with 4 option years) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity fixed-price contract for the manufacturing of the above receiver types.  In addition to manufacturing this contract will include line items for the repair and refurbishment of existing and future JSATS receivers; and support services for installation and use of each receiver type.  All functional specifications for the JSATS are government owned and will be provided in the solicitation package.  Where applicable, the design specifications and drawings for existing JSATS receivers will be provided.  Hydrophone assemblies designed specifically for JSATS receivers will be provided by the government.  This procurement action shall be conducted in two phases, an evaluation phase and a production phase.  In order to be eligible for award, and as part of the evaluation criteria, the offeror must demonstrate that their JSATS receiver meets the functional and design specifications provided in the solicitation.  The USACE will use lowest price, technically acceptable protocols for selection of up to 3 qualified firms.  These firms will be awarded contracts to enter into the evaluation phase (Phase I) of this action.  The evaluation phase shall consist of the preparation of a fully functional prototype receiver(s) that will be evaluated for performance by a USACE contractor.  Following acceptance testing of prototype receivers the USACE will use Tradeoff/Best Value protocols to select a single company to enter into the production phase (Phase II) of the contract.  Evaluation and rating factors will be included in the solicitation when issued.  The solicitation, Request for Proposal (RFP), outlining receiver specifications will be posted and ready for downloading on or about 29 April 2009.  The solicitation will be available via the internet at either websites; the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/default.cfm and Federal Business Opportunities https://www.fbo.gov.  Please submit 1 original and 5 copies of the proposal, which is due on or about 27 May 2009 by 4:00 pm Pacific Time.  Faxed or emailed copies of the proposal WILL NOT be accepted.  The Technical Manager point of contact is Brad Eppard at 503-808-4780 or email at Matthew.B.Eppard@usace.army.mil and the Contractual Administrator point of contact is Gregg Gulledge at 503-808-4634 or email at Gregg.C.Gulledge@usace.army.mil.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: MR. SORIN ZAHARCU, GENERAL MANAGER, AQUASERV S.A. TULCEA, 2 REZERVORULUI STR., 820131 TULCEA, ROMANIA, TEL.: +40 240 52 43 10, FAX: +40 240 52 43 10.

ROMANIA: TULCEA WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS PROJECT. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to 
(a) examine and propose rehabilitation methods for neglected water distribution and sewerage systems in the developed areas of Tulcea County, Romania; and 
(b) examine alternatives to the use of gaseous chlorine for potable water disinfection in Romanias easternmost city of Sulina, as well as in Tulcea.

Throughout Tulcea County, the availability of potable water is unreliable because water treatment stations and distribution pipelines have not been adequately maintained and upgraded. Sewerage infrastructure has also fallen into disrepair. The Grantee, which is the regional water company, was established in 2004 and is responsible for water infrastructure in Tulcea County, which includes both groundwater well fields and surface water from the Danube River. The Grantees current treatment technologies range from no treatment for some of the groundwater well fields to rapid sand infiltration and disinfection for the treatment of Danube River water. 

County authorities have prepared a master plan to improve local water infrastructure through 2025. A projected $517 million will be spent to upgrade water and wastewater systems within the county. The first phase of this effort has already been scoped and funded, and is proceeding in the municipalities of Tulcea, Sulina, Macin, and Iasccea. A second phase, to take place primarily in the City of Tulcea and the town of Sulina, is slated to begin after December of 2010, when the feasibility study for which the Proposal is hereby invited will support an application to the EU for project funding.

There are two components to the second project phase, the first of which is water infrastructure rehabilitation. The Grantee has identified water distribution and wastewater collection system piping that requires rehabilitation and expansion based on age (some piping dates back to 1900), disrepair (leakage approaches 75% in Tulcea and Sulina) and insufficient service to some developed areas. The project will include the rehabilitation of approximately 68.1 km of subsurface water distribution piping and 68 km of wastewater collection system piping located in three separate zones in Tulcea. Given the locations of the existing piping infrastructure beneath developed areas, rehabilitation by excavation would be both time-consuming and costly. Accordingly, The Grantee is interested in employing trenchless rehabilitation of the existing piping through the use of cured-in-place technology. This will improve the efficiency of rehabilitation and minimize excavation, costs and interruptions.

A second project component of phase 2 will be the replacement of the current chlorine gas disinfection system in Tulcea and Sulina with the on-site generation of sodium hypochlorite, which forms a sanitizing bleach solution when dissolved in water. This will help alleviate the environmental risk involved in the monthly transport of eight tons of chlorine gas from the producer to Tulcea over a distance of 300 km.  Currently, transport is made by land and involves significant environmental and social risks.  The monthly transport of chlorine gas from Tulcea to Sulina is done by boat because the water treatment plant in Sulina is not accessible by road; as such the 1 ton of chlorine gas is handled in both the ports of Tulcea and Sulina. Alternatives to sodium hypochlorite, such as the use of ultraviolet light, ozone, nanofiltration, chloramines, chlorine dioxide, or potassium permanganate, appear less suitable and less cost-effective for Sulina. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $339,400 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

<DESC><p>This sources sought notice is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the capability to provide follow-on services which sustain the existing legacy mission communication system (MCS) capabilities on four (4) C-32A (Boeing 757) and four (4) C-40B (Boeing 737) aircraft. These aircraft are located at three sites; Andrews AFB, Ramstein AFB Germany, and Hickam AFB Hawaii. This legacy system was implemented in the 2003 timeframe.</p>
<p>The on-board MCS capabilities are provided for the users consisting of Government distinguished visitors (DVs) such as; Vice President, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Combatant Commanders, etc., the DV staff members, and other passengers. The MCS capabilities consist of secure/non-secure voice calls and fax, secure/non-secure local area networks (LANs), off-board connectivity to virtual (NIPRNet), Secure Internet Protocol Network (SIPRNet), and off-board connectivity for users to connect carry-on video teleconferencing (VTC) equipment for secure and non-secure VTC sessions. Each aircraft is equipped with different types of on-board mission radio systems which allow the users to place secure/non-secure calls, faxes, and data transmissions through ultra high frequency - SATCOM (UHF-SATCOM), very high frequency/ultra high frequency (VHF/UHF) line of sight (LOS), high frequency (HF), VHF/UHF multifunction and Public Switched Telecommunications Network (PSTN) landlines. Users also have on-board LAN capabilities for example: file sharing, scanning, and printing. Communication System Operators (CSOs) are able to centrally monitor and control these capabilities using centralized CSO stations.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL SCOPE</strong>: The scope of services will consist of: (1) Obsolescence management for the MCS equipment (hardware and software) and (2) MCS Equipment (hardware and software updates on the aircraft when the equipment is no longer supportable and can no longer provide its required capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE: Obsolescence Management</strong> includes monitoring and tracking the obsolescence/supportability status of the MCS equipment (hardware and software) including contacting the equipment vendors at a minimum of every four to six months to determine supportability status and projection of when an MCS equipment item will become unsupportable/obsolete. Contractor will be required to work with the government's integrated fleet support (IFS) contractor to determine number of spares available and required and use this information to aid in the projections of when MCS equipment becomes unsupportable/obsolete.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE: MCS equipment (hardware and software) updates on&nbsp;aircraft</strong> includes the replacement or redesign of the MCS hardware and/or software which is no longer supportable and can no longer provide its required capabilities. The updates consists of all associated tasks to modify the aircraft to incorporate the updates including obtaining any required FAA certifications and any required updates to the aircraft's supplemental type certificates (STCs). As part of the process to update the equipment, contractor will be required to work with the government's IFS contractor to address changes the IFS contractor will have to make in the areas of spares, training manuals, and software maintenance. The following paragraphs outline the different types of on-board MCS equipment but are not an all inclusive list.</p>
<p><strong>MCS equipment providing off-board connectivity </strong>consists of but is not limited to the following types of antenna systems which includes the external antenna and internal antenna system; (1) Boeing Broadband Satellite Network (BBSN), (2) VHF/UHF multifunction, (3) VHF/UHF LOS, (4) HF, (5) UHF SATCOM, (6) Aero-H INMARSAT, (7) High Speed Data (HSD) Swift 64 INMARSAT, and (8) Terrestrial Aeronautical Radiotelephone System (TARS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>MCS equipment providing secure/non-secure LAN capabilities</strong> consists of but is not limited to routers, switches, file servers, scanners, printers, laptops, and CSO work stations. The CSO work stations centrally monitor and control the MCS capabilities part of which is through the use of proprietary LAN controller software developed and maintained by the current contractor.</p>
<p><strong>MCS equipment providing encryption and mission radio capabilities</strong>. Each aircraft is equipped with different types of on-board mission radio systems which allow the users to place secure/non-secure calls, faxes, and data transmissions through the off-board links/antenna systems. The MCS system also contains multiple types of NSA approved encrypting devices to encrypt voice, data, and video transmissions.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong> (1) Potential interested sources need to be able to provide the required services based on retaining the existing MCS equipment; provide a seamless transition from the incumbent to the new provider and not affect the users with aircraft downtime. Potential bidders cannot respond with a strategy which replaces the existing equipment. (2) The existing on-board MCS equipment, MCS design, applicable STCs and aircraft data is owned by the incumbent contractor. The potential interested source will need to make the necessary arrangements with the incumbent contractor to acquire the existing legacy on-board MCS equipment and obtain the necessary MCS design, any applicable proprietary software, applicable STCs, and aircraft data.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this will be a firm fixed price (FFP) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, commercial procurement. The expected period of performance will be a base year and options for up to&nbsp;four additional years. There is no guarantee of options being exercised after the second year.</p>
<p>The Government will not reimburse particpants for any expenses associated with their participation in this sources sought. The current requirement is to award this contract by the close of 2009 to allow performance to begin 1 Jan 2010. If after reviewing this information and you desire to participate by responding to this sources sought, you should provide documentation that supports your company's ability to meet the specified requirements that meets the Government's schedule. Failure to provide adequate documentation will inhibit the Government's assessment of your capabilities and such respondents will be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>This is intended to be a single award solicitation. This acquisition will utilize commercial practices to the greatest extent possible in accordance with FAR Part 12.</p>

<DESC><p>This Sources Sought Notice is for Market Research purposes only. The U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to release a solicitation to purchase a fourth Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite and to negotiate a priced option for a fifth satellite. The first three AEHF satellites will be launched in 2010-2012 after nine years of development. MCSW believes only the incumbent Prime developer is capable of performing this work, but is conduction market research to identify whether other sources exist which possess both the capability and experience to effectively respond to this notice. The responding Prime Contractor must be able to manufacture, integrate, test and deliver AEHF satellites having communications capabilities that are functional clones of the three AEHF satellites currently in production. Satellites must be fully&nbsp;backward compatible with existing ground infrastructure, to include fielded Low Rate Data (LDR) and Meduim Rate Data (MDR) terminals; in-development extended data rate (XDR) terminals; all elements of the AEHF Mission Control Segment; as well as planned or on-orbit Milstar and AEHF Satellites via their crosslink communications. The contractor must be able to perform complete spacecraft checkout in addition to inter-segment tests to include mission control, terminal, and key management interfaces. In addition, the Prime Contractor must have the ability to conduct on-orbit checkout, spacecraft and payload sustainment, and anomaly support. On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB, CO, Peterson AFB, CO and Cape Canaveral aFB, FL. Launch of the first satellite is required within seven years of the initial authorization for full funding expected in 2010. This notice is seeking only Prime Contractors, not suppliers of components, materials, software or services that may be used by a Prime Contractor to produce an AEHF satellite.</p>
<p>Qualified sources (Prime Contracors only) must demonstrate the ability to produce these satellites with minimal investment by the Government in non-recurring engineering and high confidence of success. Qualified sources must additionally demonstrate all of the following capabilities:</p>
<p>1) A high confidence solution that includes mature payload and satellite bus technologies, ceritified payload and spacecraft on-board software that meets the mission and constellation requirements, mature test products to include Electronic Aerospace Ground Equipment, Mechanical Ground Support Equipment, established scripting and validated test procedures, and a high fidelity testbed environment. The use of space qualified, build-to-print drawings for unit, sub-system and space vehicle configurable items will be essential to minimize the amount of non-recurring engineering required. Such a design must include all of the System level requirement verification products to ensure that Space Vehicle 4 both meets requirements, while not posting any risk to the Milstar/AEHF constellation and the existing requirements baseline. The qualified source will also aviod any new technology development or fundamental effort to qualify or validate new space technologies outside of the existing AEHF technology baseline with the goal of minimizing the nonrecurring engineering and related risks with their insertion.</p>
<p>2) A thorough understanding of the technical interface requirements associated with the AEHF and Milstar payloads; Air Force, Army, and Navy terminals; AEHF COMSEC/TRANSEC System; AEHF and Milstar ground control and mission planning elements; and CCS-C.</p>
<p>3) A thorough understanding of AEHF information assurance requirements, including the key management plan and architecture, key authentication, key distribution, AEHF COMSEC/TRANSEC System products/schedule/issues, cryptographic key management for test assets, and certification and accreditation requirements.</p>
<p>4) Extensive systems engineering experience, knowledge, and background dealing with DoD-specific capabilities in the EHF secure satellite communications fiels, including system requirements analysis, test and verification, risk management, and system security management. Familiarity and experience working with DoD customers, to include the Air Force Space Command, Army, Navy, and Air Force Terminal Program (TPOs), is required to resolve to terminal to payload requirements issues.</p>
<p>5) Experience and understanding of the US Government foriegn disclosure requirements for support to the AEHF International Partners, including redaction of technical documents, processing and coordination of foriegn disclosure material. Training in international programs security requirements and international security and technology transfer/control; familiarity with National Disclosure Policy (NDP-1), the Air Force Delegation of Disclosure Authority Letter (DDL) and the International Traffic in Arm Regulations (ITAR); and experience in processing Exemptions to the ITAR and the process of formulating Technical Assistane Agreements (TAAs) between US contractors and foreign governments and their contractors is required.</p>
<p>Interested parties (Prime Contractors only) may submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) within 15 days of this announcement demonstrating knowledge of AEHF satellites' critical interface requirements including hardware design, test procedures, individual spacecraft configurations and orbital procedures.</p>
<p>The SOC shall not exceed ten one sided 8 inch by 11 inch pages in length, using fonts no smaller than 12 inch, with page layout margins set to one inch both horizontally and vertically. Responses must be submitted by e-mail as Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat file type attachments. The period of performance is for 11 years and will begin in 2010. This is an extension of the existing AEHF development, procurement and support contracts currently performed by Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, Sunnyvale, CA. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposals. Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only.  It is being posted by the National Science Foundation on behalf of Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC in support of the United States Antarctic Program (USAP).

Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC, Polar Services, (RPSC) is soliciting proposals towards securing a charter for an ice capable Antarctic Research and Supply Vessel (ARSV) to operate in the Southern Ocean around the Antarctic Peninsula and other locations in support of the United States Antarctic Program (USAP).

RPSC presently charters and provides science support staffing on the R/V LAURENCE M. GOULD and the R/V NATHANIEL B. PALMER for the National Science Foundation (NSF), an agency of the United States Government.  On behalf of the NSF RPSC is pursuing the charter of a vessel to meet the oceanographic and logistics support requirements of the USAP.  The vessel is to be chartered for a period of five (5) years with options for another five (5) years.  The purpose of this announcement is to seek interested parties in industry capable of supplying a vessel to continue to provide services currently supported by the R/V LAURENCE M. GOULD.  RPSC will be seeking proposals from firms that have existing similar classed vessels.

The vessel will be required to operate frequently in the often extremely stormy waters south of Cape Horn in the Drake Passage with regular operations south of 60 degrees South Latitude and in sea ice in to support oceanographic research and USAP logistics for Palmer Station and other field locations.  The vessel must be seaworthy, fully found, appropriately classed, be able to provide a stable platform from which to conduct scientific research and comfortable enough to safely support personnel at sea for extended periods.  Such remote operations necessarily require a reliable and well fitted vessel.  Operations in support of scientific research and the requirement to re-supply and carry personnel to Palmer Station will be of equal importance within the technical requirements of the Request for proposal (RFP).

To receive a full RFP package pleases contact Jim Weber at RPSC below.  Proposals are due to RPSC by 11 May 2009 and should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning and informational purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. Data submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned. Information is being requested in order to make potential future requirement better for industry and the Government. This RFI is in support of an anticipated acquisition for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) National Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC) Information System (IS) Project. This effort will design, develop and implement an integrated NGIC IS. The government requests information pertaining to the capabilities of industry with regards to this planned project. The Government is particularly interested in the capabilities of small businesses, but large entities are not excluded from providing a response to this RFI. This RFI is part of the FBI's effort to identify and assess the business community's capability to provide IT design, development, documentation and implementation services associated with the NGIC IS. This RFI will also ask responders for their feedback to a series of questions relating to the draft requirements documents provided as Attachment A, (Draft Statement of Work, Concept of Operations, and System Requirements Specification). The mission of the National Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC) is to support law enforcement agencies through timely and accurate information sharing and strategic/tactical analysis of federal, state, and local law enforcement intelligence as it pertains to the growth, migration, criminal activity and association of violent gangs that pose a significant threat to the United States. NGIC will integrate the assets of the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and other participating federal agencies to serve as a clearinghouse and information management mechanism for gang intelligence on a national and international scope. The NGIC intelligence operation has two distinct functions to satisfy its mission:
<p>1. Research Function - Analysts receive requests for information via Law Enforcement online (LEO), fax and telephone calls, which are treated as intelligence leads. NGIC Intelligence Analysts conduct searches on existing systems, canvass contacts, and conduct interviews to provide gang intelligence to federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel across the country.</p>
<p>2. Analysis Function- NGIC Intelligence Analysts conduct strategic and tactical analysis of gang activities stored in various databases either located in NGIC space or accessible via browser-based systems. By collecting and manipulating the raw intelligence data, Analysts are able to identify patterns and trends that are published and disseminated to organizations engaged in the investigation of gangs related crimes. NGIC's objective is to become the centralized Federal resource for gang related information. NGIC will collect, store, and manage raw gang intelligence data. NGIC Analysts will have access to a broad range of external data sources to support their efforts. NGIC Analysts have access to the following systems. It is expected that the NGIC IS would provide node connectivity to these external data sources.<br />&#61607; National Crime Information Center (NCIC)<br />&#61607; Violent Gang &amp; Terrorist Organization File (VGTOF)<br />&#61607; Law Enforcement Online (LEO)<br />&#61607; Regional Information Sharing Systems (RISS)<br />&#61607; California Department of Justice GangNet (CALGANG) <br />&#61607; One DOJ System<br />&#61607; Cryptanalysis Support System (CRYSS) <br />&#61607; El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) Online<br />&#61607; National Data Exchange Program (NDEx)</p>
<p>The functional capabilities of the NGIC IS System can be organized into major services provided to NGIC users, to include:<br />User Interface Services - User access to the system will be via a browser window on their desktop. Users of the system will need to navigate to and use different data and functionality of the system simultaneously. The system will allow a user to open multiple windows and to cut and paste information between them. <br />Data Management Services - NGIC will collect gang information that has been voluntarily submitted by federal, state, local, and tribal agencies. The system must support bulk import as well as individual submissions.<br />Work Product Management Services - The system will provide the tools to author and disseminate standard and non-standard work products.<br />Intelligence Analysis - The system will provide strategic analysis tools to identify links and relationships between gang related information, and identify emerging trends and patterns of most violent gangs.<br />Program Management Services - Program management services will provide the necessary management and monitoring tools to manage this process effectively.<br />System Management Services - The system will provide for a significant amount of maintenance, primarily within the areas of account administration, security management, records management, and performance monitoring, in order for the system to perform efficiently.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
The NAVAL AIR WARFARE CENTER WEAPONS DIVISION (NAWCWD) is conducting market research to determine potential sources to meet future range support requirements.  Naval Test Wing Pacific (NTWP) and Air Test and Evaluation Squadron THREE ZERO (VX-30) currently operate uniquely modified airborne assets to support the NAWCWD Ranges in the following mission areas; Sea Test Range surveillance and clearance to Range Commanders Council safety standards; Multi-band communications relay and on-board recording (UHF, VHF); Airborne Telemetry (TM) relay and on-board recording (L-Band, S-Band, C-Band); Command Destruct/Flight Termination Systems (CD/FTS) (ability to terminate/destruct unique items under test); Airborne electro and photo optical camera systems (receive and record on-board multiple source cameras); Subscale target drone launch (not currently supported); Aerial in-flight refueling (IFR); Routine and non-routine cargo carriage and delivery to the offshore San Nicholas Island facility and other Navy test facilities as required including ordnance handling certifications.  
These aircraft perform missions that support Test and Evaluation (T&E) events on the over-water sea test range areas near Point Mugu, CA as well as support customers during T&E missions in world-wide deployments (e.g. Hawaii, Kwajelan).  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit information to assist NAWCWD in identifying qualified sources that are able to provide valuable inputs as to how NAWCWD can proceed on upgrading existing systems, development of replacement systems or system components, and/or outsourcing these capabilities in part or in whole to meet mission requirements.  The desire is to ascertain the estimated costs of development, upgrades, replacement, aircraft integration, implementation and usage in order to develop full life cycle trade offs and cost estimates.
This RFI is issued for informational and planning purposes only.  NAWCWD is conducting market research and desires input from industry to assist in planning and defining acceptable options.  This RFI will document the potential for commercial outsourcing of some or all of the required mission elements.  While it is the government's assumption that "the least number of platforms to perform the full set of missions is the least costly", it is NOT required that a single platform perform all of the required capabilities, nor is it required that a respondent address all of the mission capabilities.  It is possible that a "family of independent systems" may be required to meet all of the mission capabilities or that a family of independent systems may be less costly than one multi-mission platform that performs all missions. These systems do not necessarily need to be based solely on manned aircraft, but could be a combination of manned and unmanned platforms.  The information requested by this RFI may be used to facilitate a Request for!  Proposal (RFP) for a NAWCWD range support contract by identifying options, standard industry terminology, and practices to aid in the decision making process. 
BACKGROUND
The Weapons Division was established to provide full-spectrum Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation for Naval Aviation Systems.  Our organization has a strong foundation with an outstanding workforce, many of who are internationally recognized.  We have world class ranges and numerous one-of-a-kind laboratories and facilities that are national assets.
Point Mugu is situated on the Pacific Ocean, midway between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, California.  Point Mugu has real-time control of all air traffic within its coastal area, which permits dynamic reallocation of flight paths in order to assure safe, secure, unhindered military operations.  This enables approximately 36,000 sq. mile (approximately 180 X 220 miles) Sea Test Range to operate totally unencroached.  This range has been a major asset in the test, training and operational readiness of the majority of the sub surface, surface and aerial weapon systems in the DoD strategic and tactical inventories.PURPOSE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
This RFI will document the potential for commercial purchasing or outsourcing of some or all of the required capabilities.  It is not required that a single platform perform all of the required capabilities.  The optimum solution could involve a mix of government and commercial services, manned and unmanned aircraft, as well as non-aircraft options.  In the near future, NAWCWD must establish a plan for replacing the aging range support airborne assets.  This study will provide the analytical basis for the NAWCWD decision of whether to continue using government-owned aircraft and related systems or consider the possibility of outsourcing some or all of these functions to one or more commercial activities.
NAWCWD is open to alternative ideas. Respondents are encouraged to provide information utilizing creative and innovative solutions and alternatives that will allow NAWCWD to meet its mission requirements.  Respondents should not limit their responses to aircraft platform selections only, and are highly encouraged to respond even if their sole organizational expertise resides in component technologies (i.e., antenna design, telemetry arrays, stabilized optics or camera systems within VR, IR and near IR wavelengths, flight termination systems, etc).  Additionally, respondents are encouraged to include alternative solutions that meet only the local sea test range mission requirements, but would not be suitable for world-wide deployments (e.g. a portable or "podded" TM or Optical solution may meet local sea test range requirements, but will not meet the higher TM and/or Optical requirements for open ocean tests).
Any aircraft solution presented would be operated as a public aircraft as defined by CFR 49 U.S.C. Section 40102 (A) (41), due to the inherently governmental/military use of the aircraft.  All commercial aircraft solutions presented will leverage FAA civil aircraft type certifications, FAA aircrew training requirements and procedures, and will be augmented as necessary to ensure Navy oversight requirements of public aircraft are achieved.
In conjunction with this RFI, NTWP and NAVAIR Ranges Department are hosting an Industry Day briefing, which will be held at the Hampton Inn, in Camarillo, CA on Tuesday, April 21, 2009.  The event will be held from 8:00AM until 12:00PM (Pacific Time). Check-in will be from 7:00AM to 7:45AM. The briefing will begin promptly at 8:00AM.
To register your attendance for the Industry Day, contact Joanne Fandey via email only:  joanne.fandey@navy.mil.   Respondents should submit company information including company name, address, telephone number, and FAX number, point of contact name, phone number, e-mail address, and the name and title of all employees who plan to attend the Industry Day.  
All information in the RFI information package and the Industry Day briefing is for public release.

NOTICE:
BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION
The USPTO routinely performs monitoring to assure that the critical elements within their organization are meeting previously defined internal performance thresholds.  The USPTO uses work products that provide in-depth analysis of IT equipment within the multi-operating system environment.  TeamQuests software is a tool that works with Hewlett Packards Measure Ware, to provide real-world analytical models of the relationships between the workload elements and system resources derived from Measure Ware data that are collected on the system.  This data cannot be obtained from any other source.  There is no other software product that provides analytical queuing analysis and discrete event simulation. The TeamQuest software assistance, information and updates required to support the TeamQuest software and cannot be obtained from any other source.  There is no other source for distribution of media, for telephone support or even update distribution.  The TeamQuest product is heavily integrated and tailored to the USPTO environment.  Replacing this product line with another would place an extraordinary burden and cost increase to the agency. 

To ensure the software is maintained to the most current configuration and to assure safety and optimum operability, annual maintenance is an integral part of the necessary critical elements, as well as the infrastructure, its information assets, and the way those assets are stored, maintained and managed.  The USPTO relies upon the workload performance analysis, server capacity and usage monitoring to sustain and optimize day-to-day operations, monitor changes to current operations processes and procedures, to optimize customer productivity while reducing over-all operating costs.

Due to growth in performance demands, and the need to ensure high availability for critical applications, the USPTO requires the addition of TeamQuest software as its core software for performance monitoring.

<DESC>Market Survey Description<BR><BR>Vertical Impact Test Equipment<BR><BR>Description of Intent:<BR><BR>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a request for proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this market survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.  The purpose of this announcement is to locate and identify any interested sources capable of providing all of the hardware and supplies as identified under Vertical Impact Test Equipment.  The U.S. Army is seeking to identify vendors with the capability to provide test equipment for vertical impact testing similar to a drop tower testing.<BR><BR>Objective:<BR><BR>The U.S. Army is interested in improving the survivability of its current and future vehicle fleet against threats from landmines, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), explosively formed projectiles (EFPs), and kinetic energy rounds.  Protection of vehicle occupants against these threats is of prime consideration.  The Army needs lightweight vehicles to meet mobility and deployability requirements.  Design of lightweight vehicles to meet the conflicting requirements of survivability, mobility and deployability is very challenging.  To meet this challenge, crew protection components are optimally designed and extensively tested in the laboratory before integrating into overall vehicle design.  <BR><BR>Potential Requirement:<BR><BR>To this end, we want to set up a Vertical Impact Test (VIT) stand alone simulator similar to a drop tower to test crew protection equipment including seats, interior padding, floor solutions, etc., for the effect of forces which simulate the above mentioned vehicle threats.  The stand alone simulator will be housed in an enclosed building with a standard ceiling height of 10 feet.  The VIT stand alone simulator must be capable of testing technologies that may be floor-, side-, or ceiling-mounted and, if possible, with two or more seats at once.  It is preferred that the VIT use a renewable resource mechanism to catch or stop the impactor, and not use a one-time energy absorbing system such as aluminum honeycomb, etc.  Provide details of the proposed mechanism(s) used to catch or to stop the impactor and details of the energy source (other than gravity) if used for accelerating the impactor.  Provide total estimated weight of the VIT and the space needed for all the various parts, including decelerating mechanism and energy source for acceleration.  Provide technical details such as peak force generated, peak g-force, max velocity, max energy, and max payload weight and size.  Provide an estimated total cost of the VIT and any associated equipment.  Provide details on safety mechanisms used to prevent accidental injuries.<BR>The VIT should be capable of applying a simulated explosion half sine pulse with amplitude ranging from 60 g to 350 g, and time duration from 15 ms to 5 ms, respectively.  It should have interchangeable platforms for floor-, side-, and ceiling-mounted seating systems.  It should have an off-axis loading capability.  This device should not use live explosives.<BR><BR>Due Date for Submission of Data/Information:  31 May 2009<BR><BR>Points of Contact (please copy both with correspondence):<BR><BR>Technical:  Kari Drotleff, e-mail kari.drotleff@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Acquisition:  Tera Sinclair, e-mail tera.sinclair@us.army.mil<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller Currency intends to extend the period of performance for purchase order #Tcc-08-HQ-P-0223, by 6 months on a sole source basis with CRA.   After review of the initial statistical data that was provided by CRA the OCC determined that additional analysis was required in order to allow OCC to make process decisions.  The analysis and data created by CRA under the original purchase order award must be used in order to conduct the additional research required by the OCC as the additional research includes a review of different elements of the data already provided by CRA, i.e. a continuation of the pay analysis for 2008.  The sole source determination is based on CRA's unique experience and detailed knowledge  to analyze all of the tables and data that have been produced to date.

<DESC><p>The Health Resources and Services Administration, Division of Procurement Management (DPM), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with B L Seamon Corporation, 9001 Edmonston Road, Suite 200, Greenbelt, MD 20770 to modify Contract HHSH230200732008C entitled, "National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Recruitment, Training, and Support Center (RTSC) Contract." The purpose of the NHSC RTSC contract is to provide support to the NHSC by assisting sites who wish to make application to the NHSC for inclusion on the list of eligible NHSC service sites for NHSC clinicians and matching those clinicians to NHSC approved vacancies while considering program requirements and participant preferences to maintain clinician retention.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provides $300 million to the NHSC to support health professions educational loan repayment and scholarship. A key component of the ARRA is the creation and preservation of primary health care jobs through the NHSC Loan Repayment Program. Through ARRA, the NHSC is required to recruit and place more than 3,300 additional clinicians to serve and provide primary health care services to our Nation's neediest communities within an 18-month period. The bulk of these awards will be made within the first 6-12 months. NHSC clinicians cannot be matched to a site that is not an NHSC approved site or to a site that does not have an approved vacancy. The NHSC maintains a single "Job Opportunities List" which contains approved vacancies. Updates to the vacancy list are provided to the NHSC by the contractor through the NHSC RTSC contract (contract HHSH230200732008C). No new loan repayment awards can be made without the vacancy management services provided under the NHSC RTSC contract. By modifying the contract to add services related to ARRA funded awards, clinicians participating under both the core annual contract appropriations and the ARRA appropriations can be matched to appropriate sites in time to receive awards during the contract performance period, fulfilling the intent of the ARRA.</p>
<p>As the prime contractor for the NHSC RTSC contract, B L Seamon Corporation is the only source that can provide the required services without substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and without unacceptable delays in the fulfilling the agency's requirements. The NHSC RTSC contractor provides critical support to site approval, vacancy management (adding vacancies to the list after approval, eliminating vacancies after they have been filled), award process, clinician placement and service monitoring. The first NHSC Loan Repayment Program awards supported by the ARRA funds are due to be made in May of 2009. Without this contract support, NHSC Loan Repayment awards that provide clinicians to deliver primary health services in communities of greatest need cannot be made. This contract modification would provide the same level of critical support, which current participants receive, for clinicians who are supported by ARRA appropriations. The requested modification does not change the nature of the activities provided by the current contractor; rather, it simply increases the volume of services in order to accommodate the additional 3300 ARRA funded clinicians. No other source can provide the necessary services without substantial duplication of costs and without unacceptable delays. Therefore, as set forth in 41.U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1, the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent, not a request for competitive proposals. Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) will be posted within 14 days after award of the contract modification. Because any modification that results from this JOFOC will use ARRA funds, an ARRA intent to negotiate will be posted prior to negotiations of a resulting modification. The contact person for this requirement is Michele McDermott, Contract Specialist, Division of Procurement Management (DPM), Parklawn Building, Room 13A-19, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857-5600; phone number 301/443-1798; fax 301/443-5462.</p>

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) created an Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) to overcome problems accessing and reporting on data from multiple data sources.  The EDW provides easy access to data from a number of USPTO systems within a central location.  The EDW includes data from financial and non-financial systems currently in production and historical information from retired sources.  The EDW resides on a USPTO server serviced and maintained by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) with collaboration from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Office of Financial Management Systems (OFMS), and the contractors supporting the EDW.  

EDW reports are created using Business Objects for querying, reporting, and analysis of data.  The EDW serves as the USPTO's only cross-functional reporting system and contains more than a thousand reports from over ten data sources. The EDW is the primary source for financial management reports for managers and analysts across the USPTO. Approximately 90% of the reports that support financial management are generated from the EDW.

Please submit your capability statements identifying your experience with maintaining an Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) and creating and maintaining reports from EDW data.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONPursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-2, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has determined that the procurement of replacement of a 15KV electrical cable located at the VAMC Center, Providence, RI meets the criteria established for other than full and open competition. The following information provides support for this position:1)	Agency: Department of Veterans Affairs 830 Chalkstone AvenueProvidence, RI 029082)	Nature and description of action being approved:An 8" water main fractured after normal work hours and flooded a construction site as well as the sub-basement and a portion of the basement of the medical center. Estimated volume is well over 100,000 gallons. The construction site incurred the following damages:- Several hundred cubic yards of earth were removed and replaced as the compacting and foundation preparation work were destroyed by the flood. 	A sewer line was damaged and required replacement 	Concrete heating blankets were destroyed!0 work days of construction supervision and management were lost.3)	Description of work required to meet the agency needs:  Restore sitework to original condition4)	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition: 10 USC 2304(c)(2) and FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency"5)	Determination that proposed contractor's unique qualification of the nature of the  acquisition requires use of the authority cited: Construction contractor and sub-contractor were already mobilized and equipment was on-site when the accident occurred. In addition, contract risk remains with the construction contractor who retains liability for the sitework required for the new addition.6)	Efforts made to solicit from as many sources as practicable including whether or not a notice was or will be publicized as required by FAR Part 5.2 Quotes were not solicited from other contractors because the requirement for a rapid response to the water main break. The government would be seriously injured if the department complied with the time periods specified in FAR Part 5.203. As a result of the urgency a synopsis is not required. 7)	Contracting Officer's determination that the cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. The prices for the work were implicitly derived as the result of a competitive process used to award the construction contract. The schedule of values provided insight into the relative costs of the re-work required as a result of the flood. Data from previous modifications established some of the costs for earth removal and replacement. Other market data was used to support other miscellaneous costs.8)	Description  of the market research conducted:N/A. Construction contractor was mobilized and on-site when the emergency occurred.9)	Other facts supporting the use of other then full and open competition:Movement of earth and undercutting of the existing building's foundation require an immediate response to structural issues at the site.Breakage of a sewer line required immediate response to mitigate a public health hazard at the Medical Center.Unstable soils conditions required immediate response to ensure stability of the work site.10)	List of sources expressing interest in writing in the acquisition,  N/A11)	Actions taken by the Department to remove or overcome barriers to competition: The Department o Veterans Affairs will continue to perform market research and compete all future acquisitions when practicable.12)	I certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my Knowledge:

<DESC><p>Service Disabled Veterans Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Outreach, Training and Industries Exchange Forum, 28 May 2009</p>
<p>The Omaha District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will host a SDVOSB outreach, training and industry exchange forum in furtherance of market research of its Military, Civil, Environmental, and Engineering Programs</p>
<p>Over 18,000 Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms are currently registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. This number continues to grow.</p>
<p>To increase procurement opportunities for veterans, Congress passed the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-183). This provides acquisition set-asides for SDVOSBs. The rule implanting this Act grants acquisition professionals the authority to use the set-aside program. Executive Order 13360 further emphasizes the importance of meeting the statutory 3 percent goals.</p>
<p>America honors the extraordinary service rendered to the United States by veterans with disabilities incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during active service with the armed forces.</p>
<p>The objectives of the forum are to:</p>
<p>1. Encourage and facilitate participation by SDVOSB, and Small Business Community (SBC) members in competing for award of federal contracts.<br />2. Educate SDVOSB and SBC members on how to obtain the necessary registrations and certifications to compete for federal contracts.<br />3. Encourage stakeholders (customers, consumer and constituents) and partners to subcontract with SDVOSB and SBC members.<br />4. Educate SDVOSB, stakeholders, partners, societies, associations and agency personnel on applicable law and policies relating to participation of SDVOSB in federal contracts.<br />5. Disseminate information to SDVOSB and SBC members that will assist them in participating in awards of federal contracts.<br />6. To provide an overview of current and future government requirements.<br />7. Share innovative strategies (new technologies and radically reduced project durations) in the acquisition process.<br />8. Develop acquisition strategies and approaches for award of contracts, (2) notify incumbent contractors of consolidated requirements (3) identify industry best practices.<br />9. To encourage non-traditional Service Providers, especially SDVOSB, on how to obtain the necessary registrations and certifications to compete for NWD RBC contracts.</p>
<p>Required Registration Information</p>
<p>28 May 2009 in Omaha Nebraska at the Doubletree Hotel, 1616 Dodge Street<br />Titled: SDVOSB Outreach, Training and Industries Exchange Forum</p>
<p>Registration Fee: <br />SDVOSB (Registered in CCR) $15.00<br />All Others $50.00 <br /><br />Hosted By: Omaha District</p>
<p>Co-Sponsored By: Society of American Military Engineers, Omaha Post at www.sameomaha.org.</p>
<p>The Industry Forum will start promptly at 9:00 am and may go until 6:00 pm LOCAL TIME.<br />You must register no later than 15 May 2009 to participate in this Industry Day Forum.</p>
<p>Required Registration Information</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements. <br />Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form).

The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In evaluating an offerors past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offerors quotel and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.

<DESC>Consultant support is requested to provide information on current government and private sector practices, with a focus on other federal agencies with similar AQM functions.  Examples of information that the Forest Service requests includes:
	Scorecards in place at other federal agencies for AQM function(s) (or the private sector equivalent to a scorecard / dashboard), including information on purpose / goals, frequency, and use from an internal controls perspective.  Describe how programs are tying their scorecard to the OMB Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART), if applicable.
	Internal Process Plans in place at other federal agencies for AQM function(s) (or the private sector equivalent), including information on success of IPPs in ensuring accountability, relationship of IPPs to an agencys Internal Controls environment, and relationship of IPPs to OMB Circular A-123.
	Documentation of effective internal (agency) reviews of AQM functions in accordance with IPPs (or the private sector equivalent), including internal review processes, teams, frequency of review and follow-up, and relationship of IPPs to review findings.

The FS recognizes that many best practices exist in the private sector.  However, these organizations do not operate in the same regulatory or structural environment in which government agencies do.  Therefore, the majority of resources provided by the consultant in response to this request should be from the public sector.  Public sector resources provided should be a mix of Department of Defense and federal civilian agencies with a preference toward similar land management agencies.  At least 1 example from a private sector organization with similar functions is also required.

The IRS is seeking competitive RFQs for the following brand name requirement, license and maintenance renewal for Netscout nGenius application and network probes."  The rationale supporting this brand name requirement is that the Netscout license and maintenance renewals are needed to continue the Network Management Operations of the IRS Wide Area Network (WAN) infrastructure and support the VGNOC through the Treasury Network (TNet) transition.  These tools represent the heart of the IRS network management capability by performing tasks associated with capacity management, network utilization, proactive management of network components, engineering capabilities, reporting on trending and general health of the networks and much more.  If these components are not maintained, the data communications infrastructure of the IRS may be seriously jeopardized.

This is an RFQ and brand name justification to procure Netscout nGenius license and maintenance renewals.  The IRS is not requesting information from resellers of other brand names but manufacturers that can perform the brand name equivalent.  All manufacturers that can perform the equivalent function/services should submit their technical qualifications and literature to the following email address: Michael.A.Crawford@irs.gov.  Manufacturers should include a price quote with any information they submit for equivalent function/services.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition shall be procured using full and open competition.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Optical Technology Division, is developing measurement methods, standards, and services for optical grating scatterometry and requires a microspot spectroscopic ellipsometer capable of making measurements from small micropatterned periodic structures.   

These structures are one-dimensional or two-dimensional gratings that can be as small as 50 micrometers on a side and fabricated on silicon wafers.  A single wafer or chip may contain many such target gratings and NIST needs to be able to navigate between them.  NIST intends to measure the reflectance properties of these targets and compare the results of theoretical calculations (supplied by NIST) to determine the dimensions of the target structures.  While scatterometry measurements are typically made with the angle of incidence aligned along the grating direction, NIST intends to use the ellipsometer to perform measurements along other directions as well to enhance sensitivity to grating structure. NIST will also use the ellipsometer for traditional thin film measurements and will use the vendors  software for data analysis.
		
In its simplest form, an ellipsometer measures the ratio of the reflection coefficients for s- and p- polarizations as a complex number.  This ratio may be expressed in terms of real angles delta and psi, in terms of the tangent of psi and the cosine of delta, or in terms of alpha and beta.  These terms are generally accepted in the field and are defined in, for example, H.G. Tompkins, A Users Guide to Ellipsometry (Academic Press, Boston, 1993).  

The required ellipsometer shall, at a minimum, measure any of these pairs of values.  The ellipsometer software shall provide estimates of the variance of and covariance between these values propagated from the noise in the measurement such that at each wavelength the ellipsometric parameters expressed in any of the above formats, along with a correctly propagated noise estimates, can be output for analysis by the user.

In a generalized form, an ellipsometer can measure the ratios of the elements of the sample Jones matrix.  Generalized ellipsometers measure the ratios of the elements of the sample Jones matrix.  Generalized ellipsometers are preferred. 

All responsible quoters shall provide a quotation for all of the following line items:

STATEMENT OF WORK:

Contractor shall provide the Aperio ScanScope XT System, parts, and accessories:

The scanner and software must have the ability to create high-resolution 40x digital slides image files.  Multiple image file formats must be supported.  Appropriate file management and image viewing software that allows annotation of the images shall be provided.  The annotations must be separate from, and not modify the original images; however appropriate security to prevent miss-match of annotation file and image file is required.  Tools for file management must include data tables, and auto populated fields with barcode data and be user friendly.  The scanner must meet or exceed the following specifications to satisfy the digital slide imaging needs of NCI:

The following salient characteristics apply:

1)  Imaging capabilities:  The scanner must:
 
1.1.	be capable of fully scanning both 1x3 and 2x3 slides, inches
1.2.	produce images with no discernible stitching artifacts,
1.3.	produce high quality images at 20x and 40x optical resolutions, 40x
1.4.	produce images with an appropriate numeric aperture (at least 0.75), 
1.5.	be able to produce z-stack images, and


2)  High throughput:  The scanner must have the following characteristics:

2.1.	High capacity:  the scanner must be able to hold at least 120 slides in a given processing batch,
2.2. 	Hands free operation:  The scanner must be able to scan an entire batch of slides without user intervention, including finding the appropriate tissue area's and full multi-point auto-focus,
2.3.	Fault tolerant:  The scanner must be fault tolerant in its ability to handle difficult slides.  Should the scanner fail to scan a given slide in a processing batch, the scanner must be able to recover gracefully and complete the remainder of the batch without user interventions.  Additionally, once a batch is complete it should be clear to the operator which slide(s) failed to scan properly.  The expected failure rate should be less than 5%,
2.4.	The scanner shall be able to scan and have ready for viewing an area of 1.5cmx1.5cm in less than 2 minutes, and
2.5.	Random access:  Once a batch of slides has been scanned, the instrument must be capable of accessing the slides in a random access manner so that slides can be rescanned if needed.


3)  Research considerations: 
Because the scanner will be used for both high throughput pathology material and research material, the following criteria must be met:

3.1.	Image analysis:  An import aspect of research pathology is image analysis.  The Instrument must be able to analyze histological material for nuclear, membranous and cytoplasmic staining,
3.2.	Image analysis must be able to be performed on the image server and be initiated by a remote user,
3.3.	Image analysis must be able to be initiated in a batch analysis fashion by a remote user, and
3.4.	Analysis results must be able to be exported for an entire project or batch in a group fashion by a remote user.


4)  Server considerations: 
 	
4.1.	The scanner must store all its annotations on an external database on the NIH/NCI network with a published schema such that the database may be read from an outside application,
4.2.	All images generated shall be the property of the NCI and have no restrictions or requirement for annual licensing fees or any other fees in order to be viewed across the network, published or reproduced,
4.3.	New images must be able to be added to the server and cataloged into the database without the need of any operator intervention,
4.4.	The database (server) must be able to control individual access, password protected, rights to images and data so that unauthorized access and changes are prevented,
4.5.	The database (server) must be able to organize and manage other image types (such as standalone cameras), documents, and data from other sources,
4.6.	The scanner must store all its annotations on an external database with a publish schema such that the database may be read from an outside application,
4.7.	New images must be able to be added to the server without the need of any operator intervention,
4.8.	The scanner must come with a full database management system capable of supplementing our current pathology database (Softpath) and shared space on the NCI network with the ability to store slide images locally. To accomplish this, the system must at a minimum be capable of:
a)	organizing images into a hierarchy system representing our current pathology case system (multiple slides /case),
b)	handling multiple users with multiple user permissions based on passwords, and
c)	producing custom pathology reports.
   

5)	Digital Slide Viewing:  

5.1.	The scanned image must be immediately available for viewing following scanning without additional rendering or file conversion time,
5.2.	Image format shall be industry standard TIFF/JPEG or TIFF/JPEG2000 compliant with TIFF6.0 standard,
5.3.	The digital image created by the scanner must allow the following functions:
a.  Smooth tracking and zoom,
b.  Smart Synchronization,
c.  Grid overlay,
d.  Efficient serving of the image over the web,
e.  Automatic color correction to standard using ICC profile,
f.  Image Quality enhancement for digital stain separation, adjustment, and recombination,
5.4.	must allow the collaborative sharing of the digital image in real time from various locations, and
5.5.	Images shall be viewable locally and remotely utilizing a web-based browser system anywhere, anytime on any computer with such a web-browser.


6)	Digital Slide Management:

6.1)	The proposed solution must offer integrated image file management software  that allows for logical digital slide organization, searching, and report creation,
6.2)	The digital image management software must be role-based to allow specific user profiles for access to certain functions only as appropriate,
6.3)	The digital slide management software shall have an optional automatic TMA segmentation module,
6.4)	The digital slide management software should offer an optional compliance module to track user activity and generate reports thereof,
6.5)	The digital slide management software must offer GLP-compliance and HIPAA-compliance capability, and provide full update and access auditing capabilities,
6.6)	The digital slide management software shall use an industry-standard SQL database (e.g. Microsoft SQLServer) and should support a multi-site configuration, including the following attributes:
a.	The option for a single central database shared among all sites,
b.	Single database with authentication profiles and centralized auditing,
c.	Capability for digital slides to be scanned at multiple locations and cataloged into the central system automatically,
d.	Capability for digital slides optionally to be transferred from remote locations to central location for long-term storage and archival,
e.	Capability for remote sites to connect to central site with outbound connections only, requiring no firewall configuration changes,
f.	Industry-standard encryption of all PHI (protected health information) transmitted between remote sites and central server, and
6.7)	The digital slide management software shall be provided under FDA Quality System Regulations (QSRs) and should be part of an FDA-cleared system for one or more clinical indications.

Offerors must provide descriptive literature, or other materials that demonstrate that their offer meets the foregoing requirements.  The contract will be awarded to the responsible offeror with the lowest-price offer that fully meets the requirements of the solicitation.  


BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:

The Aperio XT Scanner (XT) will allow NCI the ability to electronically capture and store images from pathology slides at a high volume with improved quality assurance.  This technology offers the ability to view, analyze, and manage patient and research cases as digital images, and store the images in a virtual library for future retrieval.  The software (Spectrum Plus) will create an electronic teaching file for medical residents and researchers will have access to specific cases electronically, rather than the laborious task of retrieving and reviewing individual paraffin blocks and slides.  As expert pathology consultants for abnormal pathology cases from medical centers throughout the country and internationally, electronic images of cases reviewed from submitted hospitals can be returned to the originating facility.  Imaging slide sets for clinical trials allows investigators ease of access to their protocols (i.e. molecular profiling core currently uses this process for their case sets.)

PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND TELEPHONE REQUEST OR FAX REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.207(c). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov). North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) 541820 and Size Standard of $7 Million apply to this solicitation. 

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is in the final stage of implementing the congressionally mandated nationwide transition to digital broadcast television.  Approximately one-third of the Nations 1800 full-power television stations have already completed this transition.  The remaining two-thirds of full-power broadcast television stations will transition on or before June 12, 2009.

In the television markets where the digital television (DTV) transition has been completed, the FCC has learned that most individuals and households can successfully make the transition by following instructions provided with their digital-to-analog converter box or by accessing mass media materials (such as information found on the FCCs and other entities Internet sites, fact sheets and other printed materials available in libraries and community centers, calls to FCC or broadcast station help lines, or informational/demonstration programs presented by FCC staff, local television stations, and community groups).

This request for quotation (RFQ) seeks proposals from offerors with the ability to provide advertising and public relations expertise, a variety of media services, publications, and targeted distribution services that will supplement and expand our consumer education and awareness campaign relating to the digital television transition.  This is a full and open competition to enter into a contract for the successful implementation of a series of defined tasks that are outlined in detail below.

The contractor will be responsible to provide solutions to meet all of the objectives of this solicitation.  However, not all of the tasks outlined below may be utilized by the FCC in the conduct of its outreach campaign.  In essence, the FCC requires a vendor with the ability and wherewithal to provide a media tool kit, which would permit the FCC to pick and choose the deliverables based on the overall outreach plan and the consumer education needs identified.  Thus, for each of the tasks outlined, we require that a price be assigned to each specific item outlined in this Statement of Objectives (SOO).
Please submit any questions before 12:00 PM Noon Eastern, on April 13, 2009. Submit offers or any questions to eProposals@fcc.gov. Offerors who fail to complete and submit all requirements may be considered non-responsive.
The government contemplates awarding an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract pursuant to FAR Part 16.5.  The FCC intends to issue eight (8) Task Orders resulting from this solicitation, although only Task Order 1 (labor-hour) and part of Task 2 (firm-fixed-price) will be issued at the outset.  Of the remaining Task Orders, numbers 4 and 8 as well as parts of numbers 2 and 3 may be issued on a firm-fixed-price basis, while numbers 5-7 as well as the remaining parts of numbers 2 and 3 may be issued on a labor-hour basis.

Please submit any questions before 12:00 PM Noon Eastern, on April 15, 2009. Submit offers or any questions to eProposals@fcc.gov. Offerors who fail to complete and submit all requirements may be considered non-responsive.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12 and FAR Subpart 13.5 simplified acquisition procedures. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov). North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) 624190 and Size Standard of 
$7 Million apply to this solicitation. 

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is in the final stage of implementing the congressionally mandated nationwide transition to digital broadcast television.  Approximately one-third of the Nations 1800 full-power television stations have already completed this transition.  The remaining two-thirds of full-power broadcast television stations will transition on or before June 12, 2009.

In the television markets where the digital television (DTV) transition has been completed, the FCC has learned that most individuals and households can successfully make the transition by following instructions provided with their digital-to-analog converter box or by accessing mass media materials (such as information found on the FCCs and other entities Internet sites, fact sheets and other printed materials available in libraries and community centers, calls to FCC or broadcast station help lines, or informational/demonstration programs presented by FCC staff, local television stations, and community groups).

This request for quotation (RFQ) seeks proposals for DTV walk-in help centers or mobile clinics with disability access to provide these services:

o   Conducting hands-on demonstrations of how to install a digital-to-analog          
 converter box and a broadcast antenna to an analog TV, including how to       
connect a VCR or other recording device; demonstrations of how to properly             
position the antenna for the best reception of local broadcast stations; and 
demonstrations of how to operate the converter box, including scanning and 
rescanning for digital channels and the use of closed captioning features.  

o   Providing a display area for printed literature regarding the digital-to-analog converter box coupon program, connection guides for digital-to-analog converter boxes, guides for antenna and reception issues, DTV publications for those with disabilities, and local broadcast station coverage maps.  

o	Providing at static walk-in centers (preferred, but not required at mobile walk-in clinics) at least one computer with a high speed Internet connection so that consumers can apply online for converter box coupons and access other DTV transition information.  Centers and mobile clinics must also have a DVD player with a separate viewing device so consumers can watch educational videos regarding converter box installations, antennas, reception, and coverage issues, and must also provide a local or toll-free phone number so that consumers can call to inquire about location(s) and days and hours of operation. 

Additionally, statistical evidence suggests that certain geographical areas of the country are less prepared than others.  Thus, this solicitation also prefers proposals targeted to the geographical communities identified on the attached Hot Spot list  Attachment 1A.  While proposals may address any geographic area that has not already fully transitioned (see Attachment 1B  Whole-Market Transitions as of February 18, 2009), proposals focusing on Hot Spot communities are preferred. 

Proposals are requested from all potential offerors, regardless of whether they qualify as small business concerns or Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business concerns under Small Business Administration regulations, 13 C.F.R. Parts 121 and 126. However, the FCC will make awards using cascading HUBZone and small business set-asides, as described in Method for Award-Cascading Set Asides, before considering awards to offerors other than small businesses. METHOD FOR AWARDCASCADING SET-ASIDES Multiple awards will be made resulting from this solicitation using the following cascading set-aside order of preference: (1) In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.13, awards will be made on a competitive basis first to responsible, certified HUBZone small business concerns. (2) Following step (1), additional awards will be made on a competitive basis in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5 to responsible, eligible small business concerns. (3) If the contract awards under steps (1) and (2) above do not provide in-home installation services sufficient to meet the Governments needs throughout the geographic area covered by this solicitation, additional awards will be made on a full and open competition basis to responsible offerors. 

NOTE: Not-for-profit organizations are eligible to submit quotations and be considered for award in the full and open competition phase of our award process (once awards have been made to SBA certified HUBZone small businesses and other small business concerns). 

The government intends to award multiple firm-fixed price contracts. The Period of Performance for these contracts is estimated to start mid May 2009 through July 31, 2009 with special emphasis on an 8-week period identified within the statement of work (SOW). See attached file containing SOW, proposal/quote instructions and evaluation criteria.

PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND TELEPHONE REQUEST OR FAX REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. 

Please submit any questions before 12:00 PM Noon Eastern, on April 15, 2009. Submit offers or any questions to eProposals@fcc.gov. Offerors who fail to complete and submit all requirements may be considered non-responsive.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12 and FAR Subpart 13.5 simplified acquisition procedures. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov). North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) 624190 and Size Standard of 
$7 Million apply to this solicitation. 

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is in the final stage of implementing the congressionally mandated nationwide transition to digital broadcast television.  Approximately one-third of the Nations 1800 full-power television stations have already completed this transition.  The remaining two-thirds of full-power broadcast television stations will transition on or before June 12, 2009.

In the television markets where the digital television (DTV) transition has been completed, the FCC has learned that most individuals and households can successfully make the transition by following instructions provided with their digital-to-analog converter box or by accessing mass media materials (such as information found on the FCCs and other entities Internet sites, fact sheets and other printed materials available in libraries and community centers, calls to FCC or broadcast station help lines, or informational/demonstration programs presented by FCC staff, local television stations, and community groups).

This request for quotation (RFQ) seeks proposals for DTV walk-in help centers or mobile clinics with disability access to provide these services:

o	Conducting hands-on demonstrations of how to install a digital-to-analog converter box and a broadcast antenna to an analog TV, including how to       
      connect a VCR or other recording device; demonstrations of how to properly             
      position the antenna for the best reception of local broadcast stations; and 
      demonstrations of how to operate the converter box, including scanning and 
      rescanning for digital channels and the use of closed captioning features.  

o	Providing a display area for printed literature regarding the digital-to-analog converter box coupon program, connection guides for digital-to-analog converter boxes, guides for antenna and reception issues, DTV publications for those with disabilities, and local broadcast station coverage maps.  

o	Providing at static walk-in centers (preferred, but not required at mobile walk-in clinics) at least one computer with a high speed Internet connection so that consumers can apply online for converter box coupons and access other DTV transition information.  Centers and mobile clinics must also have a DVD player with a separate viewing device so consumers can watch educational videos regarding converter box installations, antennas, reception, and coverage issues, and must also provide a local or toll-free phone number so that consumers can call to inquire about location(s) and days and hours of operation. 

Additionally, statistical evidence suggests that certain geographical areas of the country are less prepared than others.  Thus, this solicitation also prefers proposals targeted to the geographical communities identified on the attached Hot Spot list  Attachment 1A.  While proposals may address any geographic area that has not already fully transitioned (see Attachment 1B  Whole-Market Transitions as of February 18, 2009), proposals focusing on Hot Spot communities are preferred. 

Proposals are requested from all potential offerors, regardless of whether they qualify as small business concerns or Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business concerns under Small Business Administration regulations, 13 C.F.R. Parts 121 and 126. However, the FCC will make awards using cascading HUBZone and small business set-asides, as described in Method for Award-Cascading Set Asides, before considering awards to offerors other than small businesses. METHOD FOR AWARDCASCADING SET-ASIDES Multiple awards will be made resulting from this solicitation using the following cascading set-aside order of preference: (1) In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.13, awards will be made on a competitive basis first to responsible, certified HUBZone small business concerns. (2) Following step (1), additional awards will be made on a competitive basis in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5 to responsible, eligible small business concerns. (3) If the contract awards under steps (1) and (2) above do not provide in-home installation services sufficient to meet the Governments needs throughout the geographic area covered by this solicitation, additional awards will be made on a full and open competition basis to responsible offerors. 

NOTE: Not-for-profit organizations are eligible to submit quotations and be considered for award in the full and open competition phase of our award process (once awards have been made to SBA certified HUBZone small businesses and other small business concerns). 

The government intends to award multiple firm-fixed price contracts. The Period of Performance for these contracts is estimated to start mid May 2009 through July 31, 2009 with special emphasis on an 8-week period identified within the statement of work (SOW). See attached file containing SOW, proposal/quote instructions and evaluation criteria.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

OBJECTIVES: 1) Evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness of artificial joints through the use of registry data that includes adequate long-term follow-up information: Analysis of common factors associated with implant success and safety such as revision rates, infection rates, quality of life measures (i.e. Harris Hip Scores, improvement in activities of daily living, etc).  2) Develop a mechanism for CDRH to analyze or receive specified analyses related to safety and effectiveness of artificial joints such as: Collaboration with doctoral students, academic institutions, medical centers, etc. to jointly conduct analyses; access to data through a secure web portal where CDRH epidemiologists can perform their own epidemiological analyses; conduct of analyses on a per-request basis. 3) Develop, collaborate and disseminate manuscripts, reports and/or presentations.
METHODS: Specific information required in the registry includes: 1) All artificial joint replacements, 2) Demographic characteristics, 3) Device characteristics, 4) Survival information, 5) Revision Rates, 6) Adverse Events, and 7) Short and long term outcomes. 

Access to data analysis through web portal or requests of specific data analysis or collaboration with a designated individual within the country who will work with CDRH to conduct any of the following: Survival analysis of length of the duration of implant; Evaluation of adverse events and relatedness to the device; Evaluation of revision rates.


Reporting Requirements and Deliverables - The successful contractor will be required to submit the following items:

1. A proposed mechanism for CDRH to analyze or receive specified analysis related to safety and effectiveness of artificial joints such as:
 Collaboration with doctoral students, academic institutions, medical centers, etc. to jointly conduct analyses (i.e. the in-country designee may have sole access and conduct analyses in collaboration with the CDRH designee);
 Access to data through a secure web portal where CDRH epidemiologists can perform their own epidemiological analyses;
 Conduct of analyses on a per-request basis.
2. Development of an agreement based on the proposed mechanism.
3. Access to data analysis through web portal or requests of specific data analysis or collaboration with a designated individual within the country who will work with CDRH to conduct the following:
 Survival analysis of length of the duration of implant related to revision rates, infection rates and other indications of adverse events or device effectiveness;
 Evaluation of adverse events and relatedness to the device;
 Evaluation of revision rates.
4. Development of a report or manuscript that has the potential to be published.

The results of this project will be disseminated to all interested parties in the FDA and to the participating institutions within the registry. They will also be presented at national and international orthopedic meetings and prepared for publication in peer-reviewed journals as agreed upon between CDRH and the contractor.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1 - RFP  192109CCO21000082


The following Questions (Q) and Answers (a) are provided to clarify any issues which may potentially be confusing in nature. 

1.	(Q) The Sleeping Room dates located on the NSLD Washington, DC worksheet line items indicated April dates while the rest of the worksheet indicates September dates.  Which is the correct date to submit a proposal for?
            a.	The Proposal Workbook contained an error on the ESLD (Washington, DC) conference worksheet tab.  The Sleeping Room lines contained the wrong dates. The dates have been corrected.  Use the Revised version of the Workbook attached instead of the original Proposal attachment. The correct dates are for September and not April.
2.	(Q) Should my firm only submit the proposal workbook as our response?
            a.	The Proposal Workbook is necessary for consideration in the response however it is not necessarily the only submission that is expected in an offerors proposal.  Read the solicitation in its entirety as the solicitation includes the following information:  
1.	A completed Hotel Contract with non-commissionable meeting rates shall also be submitted with your proposal, along with descriptive literature to include sleeping rooms, meeting room space, diagrams and square footage, information (availability/cost) on amenities of hotel i.e., parking, shuttle services; transportation to/from airport, and menus.  As well as, A response to requirements listed shall be submitted on letterhead and must address all requirements listed in a separate technical proposal.

Background:  Attendees at conferences will not have personal travel capabilities and it necessary to evaluate accomodations which are to be indicated in each offerors response with the documents requested previously.

2.	Offerors are advised to reread paragraph 5 of the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation concerning the Government position on use of certain paragraphs within the Firms Commercial Contracts.  Additionally, any issues concerning any arbitration are to be conducted in accordance with the Federal Claims Act. 

3.	(Q) My firm can only provide services for one or two dates and/or locations. Can I submit a proposal for only those dates/location for which I can provide services? 

             a.	Yes.  It is not necessary to submit a proposal for all conference locations/dates to be considered. Proposals are requested from firms to provide services for any or all requested dates however, if submitting a proposal for any one given date then it is expected that all services for that particular conference are to be provided as indicated in the solicitation located within the Proposal Workbook.

The original combined synopsis/solicitation indicated that the action will be posted for 15 days. The correct calculation should read approximately 14 days.  

The original response date remains unchanged at 12:00 pm CST (Dallas) on March 12, 2009.  Proposals are requested to be emailed only to eva.fulton@dhs.gov. Proposals received after 12pm will be considered nonresponsive.

<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for new and unique research to increase AFRL's knowledge and understanding of audio exploitation technologies for support of military operations. The scope of this effort covers a broad range of audio and speech processing technologies not limited to: speaker identification, language/ dialect identification, obtaining the gist of a conversation by recognition of words and phrases, uncooperative speaker audio language translation, whispered speech detection, audio transmission segmentation in continuous speech, background noise identification, channel effect mitigation, usable speech determination, interference (noise and competing talkers) reduction, voice stress analysis, speaker verification, coding to preserve the characteristics of the talker and channel, watermarking, and correlation. Emphasis for this research are techniques and methods for use in tactical (Avg. 9 dB signal-to-noise ratio, &lt;5 seconds recognition time, minimum training time) military environment. Deliverables will be technical reports and, when appropriate, software demonstrations with associated data.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $22M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 08 - $6M; FY 09 - $6M; and FY10 - $6M; and FY 11 - $4M. Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $100K to $600K per year. There is also potential to make awards outside this range.

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, in which Criteria (1) through (3) are of equal importance and criteria (4) is of lesser importance than criteria (1) through (3), will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Application of the Approach to the Tactical Audio Processing Mission, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>4. OTHER INFORMATION: Government Facilities/Base Support - Software demonstration of developed technology under the BAA will be required at AFRL in a government provided unclassified or classified facility (depending on the technology developed) at the conclusion of each award.</p>

<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5315.90, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (Aug 2005) will be incorporated into all contracts awarded under this BAA. The AFRL Ombudsman is as follows:</p>

<p>The Acquisition and Contracting Division (AFCEE/AC), Brooks City-Base Texas, in support of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) is conducting an acquisition for the Environmental, Construction and Operations &amp; Services 2009 (ECOS09) program. This is a source selection for environmental, construction and operations and services at sites located primarily on DoD (mostly Air Force) installations worldwide with an emphasis on CONUS, for which AFCEE customers have responsibility. ECOS09 is 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Requirements under this contract will primarily support environmental restoration/remediation and operations/services efforts; but requirements may also include traditional minor construction, demolition, and repair. Stand-alone design and conceptual work plan/implementation work plan (CWP/IWP) are NOT included in the scope of this contract. Requirements shall be carried out as specified under TOs at locations worldwide, with emphasis on the Continental United States (CONUS). This is a follow-on contract to the current ECOS contract and is critical to meet AFCEE's future mission and anticipated workload.</p>
<p>Source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements. The contracts are contemplated to be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) pricing arrangements. This requirement is a small business set-aside consisting of approximately five (5) to eight (8) awards and will have a ceiling of $350M. The Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no contracts based on the quality and quantity of the proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 562910 (500 employees or less). This size standard applies for establishment of eligibility as a small business.</p>
<p>Excess bonding capacity is $2.5M. Contract Fair Opportunity Selection and Ordering Procedure clauses will be used to compete task orders against the successful offerors. Terms of contract(s) include a five year ordering period plus two additional years for performance.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates releasing the RFP on or about 14 November 2008. The RFP will be issued via FedBizOpps and posted on the AFCEE ECOS09 website, located at https://www.afceeprivweb.brooks.af.mil/pkv/ecos09/default.asp. All contractors interested in receiving information on this acquisition are encouraged to register with the FedBizOpps website as well as the AFCEE ECOS09 website listed above. Note: Only small business firms can register on the ECOS09 website as interested primes.</p>
<p>No hard copies of this solicitation will be issued. All proposals must be received by the due date and time specified in the RFP. The due date will be no less than 30 calendar days after the release of the RFP. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the RFP for the actual issuance date, proposal due date/time, and delivery address. Inquiries may be directed to sheri.brassfield@brooks.af.mil and yvonne.camarce@brooks.af.mil. Please ensure emails are sent to both POCs.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Air force is seeking information from interested parties on a space environment sensing capability that will address sensors and systems to collect space environmental parameters.&nbsp; Acquisition of the capability start in Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2010 with an initial capability in GFY2015.&nbsp; The capability is required through GFY 2020.&nbsp; The Air Force has a requirement to continue to provide space environmental data in the most cost effective way possible when the DMSP mission ends.&nbsp; The requirement basis for this effort is the Natioanl Polar-Orbiting Environmental Satellite System NPOESS IORD-II, Joint Requirement Operations Council approved, Oct 2001.&nbsp; Furthermore this effort will be filling a void that will allow continuity of space environmental measurements and preservation of national capabilities required today and in the future as the United State formulates plans for&nbsp;National Space Situational Awareness architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Air Force is interested in addressing the gap resulting from the de-manifestation of the space environmental sensing capabilities from the National Polar-Orbiting environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important is the rapid collection, ingestion, processing, analysis, exploitation, and dissemination in a manner suitable to user needs.&nbsp; Therefore, the Air Force is interested in companies who understand both the operational systems in place to provide space environmental products and how to improve the sensor-toshooter chain of events to improce space environment situation awareness and application for strategic and tactical operations.&nbsp; The Air Force is evaluating all possible solutions sets, including the employment of commercial systems as a data provider with sensors already on-orbit or hosting sensors on future platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objective is to define an acquisition program that uses low-risk technologies (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 or greater) previously integrated on a bus and launch vehicles (if necessary) provided by contractors with a documented proven track record of mission success. We encourage collaboration among industry partners to identify innovative approaches for exploiting already available data to provide parameters we are seeking. For planning purposes, we would anticipate an incremental delivery strategy to rapidly fill the data collection gap, while concurrently investing in space weather modeling and system effects Science and Technology essential to translate measurements into actionable space weather products. This is in line with the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for Space's letter dated 14 March 2007, titled "'Back to Basics' and Implementing a Block Approach for Space Acquisition".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;16b. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current, existing technologies (or with possible minor modifications) that can be used to meet the sensing capabilities described in this paragraph and paragraph 16d. Cost is a major consideration; therefore, the government is interested in cost information for individual requirements defined in paragraph 16d. The DMSG program office is interested in information from Industry as well as Government Labs.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the Government is working with the nation's national laboratories to leverage their wealth of knowledge in space environment. The complement of government resources and industry experts would provide an overall space environment sensing and exploitation program that optimizes the investment. We are not seeking competition between government labs and industry. The government team will conduct a thorough analysis of present and future space environment models, applications, system effects algorithms, and decision aids and generate roadmaps and product threads for delivering improved space environment situation awareness user products using Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) data.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Air Force will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>
<p>16c. DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>AFWA - Air Force Weather Agency <br />C3 - Command, Control and Communications <br />DMSP - Defense Meteorological Satellite Program<br />DoD - Department of Defense <br />EDR - Environmental Data Record <br />GFY - Government Fiscal Year <br />ICD - Interface Control Document <br />IOC - Initial Operational Capability<br />IORD - Integrated Operational Requirements Document <br />KPP - Key Performance Parameters<br />KSA - Key Support Areas<br />NPOESS - National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System <br />POC - Point of Contact<br />RFI - Request for Information <br />SDR - Sensor Data Record<br />SSAEM - Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring<br />TRL -Technology Readiness Level</p>
<p>&nbsp;16d. SENSING CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT</p>
<p>For this effort, the IORD-II ionospheric electron density profile characteristics and scintillation measurements are considered Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and must be satisfied. We are searching for possible solutions to satisfy the remaining Environmental Data Records (EDRs), considered as Key Support Areas (KSA) and are seeking possible innovative approaches to solve multiple requirements. The following list is the environmental data records as approved by the Senior User Advisory Group in priority order and are based on recommendations from the NPOESS Joint Agency Requirements Group:</p>
<p>1. Electron Density Profile<br />2. Ionospheric Scintillation<br />3. Neutral Density Profile<br />4. Auroral Imagery<br />5. Auroral Energy Deposition<br />6. Auroral Particles<br />7. Energetic Ions<br />8. Electric Field<br />9. Medium Energy Particles<br />10. Geomagnetic Field<br />11. In-Situ Plasma Temperatures<br />12. In-Situ Plasma Fluctuations<br />13. Auroral Boundary</p>
<p>AFSPC top model/system effects product groupings are list below:</p>
<p>1. Ionospheric Parameters to Feed Physics-Based Ionospheric Models<br />2. Scintillation <br />3. Radar <br />4. Satellite</p>
<p>The Air Force is considering alternatives for acquiring space environmental data in support of the KPPs and KSAs. The system may include an orbital hardware follow-on concept, leveraging of planned programmed assets (both ground and space-based), and/or shared/purchased data and must address the operational data processing to ready the Sensor Data Records (SDR) and EDRs for deposition in an environmental database. Any system technology with a DoD TRL less than 7 (each component must have been demonstrated successfully on-orbit) shall not be included unless the company can show a path to flight worthiness via a Space Test Program launch or other means. We expect the most economic path to success for sensor measurements is available through hosting sensors on rides of opportunity.</p>
<p>The ground component must include any required software required to calculate appropriate engineering parameters for insertion into the Air Force Weather Agency's (AFWA) operational database. Any manipulation of the data beyond calculating SDRs and EDRs is not part of this effort; however, the contractors must understand the current and planned data processing algorithms beyond EDRs, global modeling, and system effects products.</p>
<p>We expect respondents to be challenged by selecting sensors and sensor suites to satisfy the KPPs while looking for avenues to satisfy KSAs and having the right data to drive models resulting in high quality system effects products. We expect a variety of options with pros, cons, risks, and discussion of trade space for the government to consider. Government investment of sensors on-orbit or planned that can fulfill requirements via alternative data processing is highly encouraged.</p>
<p>Command, control, and communications (C3) ground system trades may include maintaining/upgrading Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) or other legacy systems or commercial options. For planning purposes, anticipate a first launch availability of 1st quarter GFY 2015. Baseline spacecraft life should be 5 years with a probability of success greater than or equal to 70%. Other architectures are encouraged as long as they are cost effective and do not require increased system development. Though the baseline concept is outlined above for reference, respondents with a proven track record are encouraged to submit innovative alternatives that represent low risk and provide incremental improvements.</p>
<p>Responses should address the technologies available to deliver environmental data as described with supporting structures such as launch, spacecraft requirements and C3. The respondent should provide cost and schedule assumptions associated with each technology addressed. The Air Force is interested in separate cost and schedule estimates for each area. The cost estimate should also include software to process the satellite data stream into SDRs and EDRs at AFWA and ready them for deposition into an operational database.</p>
<p>The following assumptions should be used for cost and schedule estimation: <br />1. Cost/schedule estimate will be at 80% confidence level and responders may also include figures from various confidence levels if desired<br />2. Spacecraft/payload life should be 5 years with a probability of success greater than or equal to 70%<br />3. Solutions will be low risk by using TRL 7 or greater<br />4. IOC is 3rd quarter GFY 2015 with capability required through GFY 2020<br />5. 3rd quarter GFY 2010 contract award<br />6. Costs should be broken out to the lowest level possible - costs should be identified by individual EDRs and sensor<br />7. Include program level costs - Systems Engineering, Program Management, Integration, Assembly and Test Full-Time Equivalent support, etc<br />8. EDRs #1 and #2 must be satisfied, all other EDRs are optional, but highly desirable<br />9. Include software costs to process/prepare the satellite data stream for insertion into AFWA's operational database. Once AWFA has the data, no further effort is required.<br />10. Costs should be separated between development and production costs<br />11. Provide time-phased costs and detailed information on inflation rates used<br />12. Do not include award fee in cost estimate<br />13. Include discussion of any cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations<br />14. Each solution's detailed cost estimate should be accompanied by a matrix-style summary spreadsheet showing how each option satisfies the EDRs and their respective costs - i.e. Option 1 has 2 sensors; sensor 1 satisfies EDRs 1 and 3 and costs $XX, sensor 2 satisfies EDR 2 and costs $XY, etc</p>
<p>Again, these assumptions are given for cost estimation and planning purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes.</p>
<p>16e. SENSING CAPABILITY DESIRED TECHNICAL GOALS</p>
<p>The baseline requirement set is the current NPOESS IORD-II (available on request). This includes spacecraft collection and processing and transmission to proposed ground sites as well as Objective and Threshold performance requirements.</p>
<p>16f. SENSING CAPABILITY SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE</p>
<p>Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI. This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government. Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their responses as they see fit.</p>
<p>Section 1 - Technological Alternatives</p>
<p>Briefly describe one or more technological alternatives, including the reliability, flight heritage and technology readiness characteristics of the alternatives. (3-5 pages per alternative)</p>
<p>Section 2 - Feasibility Assessment</p>
<p>Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks. (1 page per alternative)</p>
<p>Section 3 - Cost and Schedule Estimates</p>
<p>Provide cost and schedule estimates for each alternative. The desired business information is an 80% confidence estimate of cost and schedule risk to produce a cost effective system. These assumptions are given for cost estimation purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes. (2-3 pages)</p>
<p>The assumptions in paragraph 16d may be used for cost and schedule estimation.</p>
<p>Section 4 - Corporate Expertise</p>
<p>Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant.</p>
<p>In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach, and any relevant lessons learned. (no suggested page count)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Section 5 - Additional Materials</p>
<p>Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussions you deem appropriate. Include any recommended structure of the requirements in the event the government plans to issue a request for proposal.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Air force is seeking information from interested parties on a space environment sensing capability that will address sensors and systems to collect space environmental parameters.&nbsp; Acquisition of the capability start in Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2010 with an initial capability in GFY2015.&nbsp; The capability is required through GFY 2020.&nbsp; The Air Force has a requirement to continue to provide space environmental data in the most cost effective way possible when the DMSP mission ends.&nbsp; The requirement basis for this effort is the Natioanl Polar-Orbiting Environmental Satellite System NPOESS IORD-II, Joint Requirement Operations Council approved, Oct 2001.&nbsp; Furthermore this effort will be filling a void that will allow continuity of space environmental measurements and preservation of national capabilities required today and in the future as the United State formulates plans for&nbsp;National Space Situational Awareness architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Air Force is interested in addressing the gap resulting from the de-manifestation of the space environmental sensing capabilities from the National Polar-Orbiting environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important is the rapid collection, ingestion, processing, analysis, exploitation, and dissemination in a manner suitable to user needs.&nbsp; Therefore, the Air Force is interested in companies who understand both the operational systems in place to provide space environmental products and how to improve the sensor-toshooter chain of events to improce space environment situation awareness and application for strategic and tactical operations.&nbsp; The Air Force is evaluating all possible solutions sets, including the employment of commercial systems as a data provider with sensors already on-orbit or hosting sensors on future platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objective is to define an acquisition program that uses low-risk technologies (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 or greater) previously integrated on a bus and launch vehicles (if necessary) provided by contractors with a documented proven track record of mission success. We encourage collaboration among industry partners to identify innovative approaches for exploiting already available data to provide parameters we are seeking. For planning purposes, we would anticipate an incremental delivery strategy to rapidly fill the data collection gap, while concurrently investing in space weather modeling and system effects Science and Technology essential to translate measurements into actionable space weather products. This is in line with the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for Space's letter dated 14 March 2007, titled "'Back to Basics' and Implementing a Block Approach for Space Acquisition".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;16b. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current, existing technologies (or with possible minor modifications) that can be used to meet the sensing capabilities described in this paragraph and paragraph 16d. Cost is a major consideration; therefore, the government is interested in cost information for individual requirements defined in paragraph 16d. The DMSG program office is interested in information from Industry as well as Government Labs.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the Government is working with the nation's national laboratories to leverage their wealth of knowledge in space environment. The complement of government resources and industry experts would provide an overall space environment sensing and exploitation program that optimizes the investment. We are not seeking competition between government labs and industry. The government team will conduct a thorough analysis of present and future space environment models, applications, system effects algorithms, and decision aids and generate roadmaps and product threads for delivering improved space environment situation awareness user products using Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) data.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Air Force will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>

<p>&nbsp;16d. SENSING CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT</p>
<p>For this effort, the IORD-II ionospheric electron density profile characteristics and scintillation measurements are considered Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and must be satisfied. We are searching for possible solutions to satisfy the remaining Environmental Data Records (EDRs), considered as Key Support Areas (KSA) and are seeking possible innovative approaches to solve multiple requirements. The following list is the environmental data records as approved by the Senior User Advisory Group in priority order and are based on recommendations from the NPOESS Joint Agency Requirements Group:</p>
<p>1. Electron Density Profile<br />2. Ionospheric Scintillation<br />3. Neutral Density Profile<br />4. Auroral Imagery<br />5. Auroral Energy Deposition<br />6. Auroral Particles<br />7. Energetic Ions<br />8. Electric Field<br />9. Medium Energy Particles<br />10. Geomagnetic Field<br />11. In-Situ Plasma Temperatures<br />12. In-Situ Plasma Fluctuations<br />13. Auroral Boundary</p>
<p>AFSPC top model/system effects product groupings are list below:</p>
<p>1. Ionospheric Parameters to Feed Physics-Based Ionospheric Models<br />2. Scintillation <br />3. Radar <br />4. Satellite</p>
<p>The Air Force is considering alternatives for acquiring space environmental data in support of the KPPs and KSAs. The system may include an orbital hardware follow-on concept, leveraging of planned programmed assets (both ground and space-based), and/or shared/purchased data and must address the operational data processing to ready the Sensor Data Records (SDR) and EDRs for deposition in an environmental database. Any system technology with a DoD TRL less than 7 (each component must have been demonstrated successfully on-orbit) shall not be included unless the company can show a path to flight worthiness via a Space Test Program launch or other means. We expect the most economic path to success for sensor measurements is available through hosting sensors on rides of opportunity.</p>
<p>The ground component must include any required software required to calculate appropriate engineering parameters for insertion into the Air Force Weather Agency's (AFWA) operational database. Any manipulation of the data beyond calculating SDRs and EDRs is not part of this effort; however, the contractors must understand the current and planned data processing algorithms beyond EDRs, global modeling, and system effects products.</p>
<p>We expect respondents to be challenged by selecting sensors and sensor suites to satisfy the KPPs while looking for avenues to satisfy KSAs and having the right data to drive models resulting in high quality system effects products. We expect a variety of options with pros, cons, risks, and discussion of trade space for the government to consider. Government investment of sensors on-orbit or planned that can fulfill requirements via alternative data processing is highly encouraged.</p>
<p>Command, control, and communications (C3) ground system trades may include maintaining/upgrading Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) or other legacy systems or commercial options. For planning purposes, anticipate a first launch availability of 1st quarter GFY 2015. Baseline spacecraft life should be 5 years with a probability of success greater than or equal to 70%. Other architectures are encouraged as long as they are cost effective and do not require increased system development. Though the baseline concept is outlined above for reference, respondents with a proven track record are encouraged to submit innovative alternatives that represent low risk and provide incremental improvements.</p>
<p>Responses should address the technologies available to deliver environmental data as described with supporting structures such as launch, spacecraft requirements and C3. The respondent should provide cost and schedule assumptions associated with each technology addressed. The Air Force is interested in separate cost and schedule estimates for each area. The cost estimate should also include software to process the satellite data stream into SDRs and EDRs at AFWA and ready them for deposition into an operational database.</p>
<p>The following assumptions should be used for cost and schedule estimation: <br />1. Cost/schedule estimate will be at 80% confidence level and responders may also include figures from various confidence levels if desired<br />2. Spacecraft/payload life should be 5 years with a probability of success greater than or equal to 70%<br />3. Solutions will be low risk by using TRL 7 or greater<br />4. IOC is 3rd quarter GFY 2015 with capability required through GFY 2020<br />5. 3rd quarter GFY 2010 contract award<br />6. Costs should be broken out to the lowest level possible - costs should be identified by individual EDRs and sensor<br />7. Include program level costs - Systems Engineering, Program Management, Integration, Assembly and Test Full-Time Equivalent support, etc<br />8. EDRs #1 and #2 must be satisfied, all other EDRs are optional, but highly desirable<br />9. Include software costs to process/prepare the satellite data stream for insertion into AFWA's operational database. Once AWFA has the data, no further effort is required.<br />10. Costs should be separated between development and production costs<br />11. Provide time-phased costs and detailed information on inflation rates used<br />12. Do not include award fee in cost estimate<br />13. Include discussion of any cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations<br />14. Each solution's detailed cost estimate should be accompanied by a matrix-style summary spreadsheet showing how each option satisfies the EDRs and their respective costs - i.e. Option 1 has 2 sensors; sensor 1 satisfies EDRs 1 and 3 and costs $XX, sensor 2 satisfies EDR 2 and costs $XY, etc</p>
<p>Again, these assumptions are given for cost estimation and planning purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes.</p>
<p>16e. SENSING CAPABILITY DESIRED TECHNICAL GOALS</p>
<p>The baseline requirement set is the current NPOESS IORD-II (available on request). This includes spacecraft collection and processing and transmission to proposed ground sites as well as Objective and Threshold performance requirements.</p>
<p>16f. SENSING CAPABILITY SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE</p>
<p>Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI. This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government. Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their responses as they see fit.</p>
<p>Section 1 - Technological Alternatives</p>
<p>Briefly describe one or more technological alternatives, including the reliability, flight heritage and technology readiness characteristics of the alternatives. (3-5 pages per alternative)</p>
<p>Section 2 - Feasibility Assessment</p>
<p>Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks. (1 page per alternative)</p>
<p>Section 3 - Cost and Schedule Estimates</p>
<p>Provide cost and schedule estimates for each alternative. The desired business information is an 80% confidence estimate of cost and schedule risk to produce a cost effective system. These assumptions are given for cost estimation purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes. (2-3 pages)</p>
<p>The assumptions in paragraph 16d may be used for cost and schedule estimation.</p>
<p>Section 4 - Corporate Expertise</p>
<p>Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant.</p>
<p>In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach, and any relevant lessons learned. (no suggested page count)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Section 5 - Additional Materials</p>
<p>Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussions you deem appropriate. Include any recommended structure of the requirements in the event the government plans to issue a request for proposal.</p>

In order to compete for this effort all interested parties must have an existing system that is fully capable of meeting the FAA's immediate requirements.
The ODL Telecommunications System/Service consists of routing and delivery of messages used in the provision of Air Traffic Control (ATC) services, which originate from and are addressed to FAA ATC automation systems.
This service must be provided to the New York, Oakland and Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC), the William J Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC).  The service supports Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP), Flight Data Processor (FDP2000) system, and Future Air Navigation System (FANS 1/A) aircraft.
The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing: Message Routing and Delivery service and Network Access for ODL Telecommunications System/Service.  Vendors must demonstrate that they have the following capabilities/knowledge:	Provide Hardware and Software equipment/infrastructure including satellite network service for an ODL Telecommunications service/system.	Engineering and Maintenance services for ODL equipment.	Provide technical support for Interface Testing of the ATOP and FDP2000 systems.	Knowledge of existing ODL FAA system.
The estimated value for this requirement is $3,000,000 to $5,000,000.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing ODL Telecommunications System/Service.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541990, with a size standard of $7.0 million.   
Attached is a draft of the statement of work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments. 
All pages for the submissions must conform to the following format: minimum 10 point font, 1 inch margins, single sided, no foldouts, and be on 8.5 X 11 size paper.
All responses to this market survey must be received by April 22, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time.  Responses may be hand delivered or sent via e-mail to:

<DESC>The original announcement for this project contained the wrong NAICS code. This modification to the announcement changes the NAICS code from 236220 to 237990.  This project consists of the demolition of 600-feet of existing timber pier and replacement with 600-feet of concrete pier.  The existing pier is approximately 1200 feet long and consists of two main segments: an inner 600-foot long timber segment and an outer 600-foot long concrete segment.  The inner 600-foot long timber segment is being replaced with a concrete pier.  The timber pier segment was constructed in the mid 1940s.  The new concrete pier consists of pre-cast concrete piles, cast-in-place pile caps and pre-cast decking.  Utilities will be provided on the new concrete pier.  An environmental remediation component is also part of this project.  The remediation will consist of removal of in water sediments and slag.  The cleanup area encompasses approximately 1.2 acres of the near shore sediments and slag.  Supporting facilities include addition to existing riser building, pavement patching, temporary fencing and extension of a new electric service to the pier.  The solicitation will contain the following as options:  Option 1  All labor, equipment and materials required to remediate the near shore contaminated soils and slag.  The remediation will consist of removal of the contaminated sediment and replacement with clean soil.  Option 2 - All labor, equipment and materials associated with providing temporary access to the outer pier during construction.  Contract duration is 365 days and all in-water work such as pile demolition, pile installation and sediment/slag cleanup will be complete in one fish window.  The estimated price range is between $10,000,000.00 and $25,000,000.00.   NAICS is 237990.  Size Standard is $33.5M.  This solicitation will be awarded using the Technical Tradeoff (Best Value) approach.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the following technical factors: Experience, Past Performance, and Management. All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined, are equal to cost or price. This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement.  A pre-proposal conference will be held.  Exact time and date will be included in the solicitation.  Approximate issue date for the solicitation is April 21, 2009 and approximate closing date is May 21, 2009 at 2:00 p.m. (local time = EDT).  This requirement is included or provided for in the financial plan for fiscal year 2009.  The accounting classification will be 21 2009/2010 2081 132 R0600684.  This statement is not a commitment of funds.  This is subject to the availability of funds (SAF).  This project is a part of the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009.  The following ARRA clauses will be included in the solicitation/contract:  FAR 52.225-21-24, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act) -- Buy American Requirements for Construction Material; FAR 52.203-15, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act) -- Whistleblower Protections; FAR Subpart 5.7, Publicizing Requirements Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009; FAR 52.204-11, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act) -- Reporting Requirements; FAR 52.212-5, FAR 52.214-26, FAR 52.215-2, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act) -- GAO/IG Access.

<AWARDEE>The Boston Consulting Group, 4800 Hampden Lane
Suite 500, Bethesda, MD 20814 US
<DESC>C.1  SCOPE OF WORK
 
A.  Objective
 
The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) requires immediate management consulting services to: a) assist in Treasurys continued assessment of the automotive sector generally; b) assist in Treasurys work with General Motors Corporation (GM) and GM advisors to develop a comprehensive restructuring and business plan acceptable to the Government (GM Restructuring) and thoroughly evaluate that plan; and c) advise Treasury with respect to the results of its comprehensive diligence exercise evaluating the viability of the announced alliance between Fiat and Chrysler, LLC (Chrysler Alliance). 
 
B.  Background 
 
On December 19, 2008, the Treasury announced that it would act to support certain domestic automobile manufacturers, on the condition that they move quickly to develop and adopt acceptable plans for long term viability.  This step was intended to prevent significant disruption to the economy, while putting the companies on a path to the significant restructuring necessary to achieve long-term viability.  
 
On February 20, 2009, the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry (PTFAI) was announced.  The PTFAI, which includes Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner as a co-chair and member, is currently working with GM to develop a restructuring plan for GM that would be acceptable to the Government, evaluate the viability of a Fiat/Chrysler, LLC alliance, and alleviate the pressure that the current economic situation has placed on other aspects of the automotive industry, including automobile finance companies, suppliers, and dealers.  In fact, on March 30, 2009, the President announced a new plan to address the needs of GM and Chrysler, LLC (Chrysler) focusing on a GM Restructuring and the Chrysler Alliance, respectively.  GM has been given 60 days to develop a new, workable business plan and Chrysler has been given 30 days to conduct due diligence and to negotiate a final agreement with Fiat.  Given these deadlines, there is extreme urgency in the timing of the work that needs to be completed.  The Treasury requires the services of a management consulting firm to timely assist the Treasury concerning this work.  In the case of GM, the Treasury and the Contractor will work with GM and its advisors to create a viable business plan that is acceptable to the Government as a roadmap for the company, including a detailed operating plan and financial plan.  For Chrysler, the Treasury, with the assistance of the Contractor, will critically assess the likelihood of success of the Chrysler Alliance and determine whether to extend financing to support the transaction.  
 
In furtherance of Treasurys need to make such assessments and provide recommendations regarding the automotive industry, Treasury is seeking assistance in continuing its assessment of the automotive sector generally as well as evaluating the GM Restructuring and the Chrysler Alliance.
 
C.  Scope
 
As detailed in Section A above, the scope of the services required is management consulting services with direct applicability to the evaluation of the GM Restructuring and the Chrysler Alliance.  These services will support the work of the Treasury in its participation on the PTFAI and its administration of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP).  

D.  Contractor Qualifications

The Contractor must have an understanding of the competitive dynamics within the auto industry, the industry structure and the stated financial and economic drivers for GM and Chrysler.  It is important that the Contractor have a global perspective on the industry to assess both the domestic and international operations of these companies.  Most importantly, the Contractor must have an understanding of the internal economics, key operational issues, business drivers and management personnel of GM and Chrysler.  Additionally, the Contractor must have an understanding of Fiats operations to be able to fully evaluate the Chrysler Alliance.  

Assessments performed pursuant to this statement of work are anticipated to involve a significant degree of operational intensity and will require intimate knowledge of the inner workings of GM and Chrysler as a basis by which to assess their plans.
 
E.  Anticipated Work
 
In furtherance of its requirement to assist the Treasury in evaluating the automotive restructuring plans and to provide recommendations regarding the automotive industry, Treasury is seeking assistance in building upon its initial work assessing the automotive sector both generally (including but not limited to, stakeholders or constituencies that are either directly or indirectly impacted by the automotive sector) and critically, (b) working closely with GM, GM advisors, and Treasury in the creation of a new, comprehensive restructuring and business plan for GM that is acceptable to the Government, and thoroughly evaluating that plan, as well as (c) evaluating the merits of the Chrysler Alliance.

Such assistance will include, but is not limited to, reviewing and analyzing a great deal of information about the automotive sector broadly, and GM and Chrysler specifically, either through resources held by the Government, the Contractor, GM, Chrysler or Fiat, or otherwise acquired at the Contractors expense.  Specific matters to be reviewed and analyzed include, but are not limited to, an evaluation of: anticipated market size and car sale volumes over a five year period; market share considerations for GM and Chrysler; competitive dynamics within the automotive industry; pricing, cost and margin prospects for GM and Chrysler; and the sales prospects for Fiat-derived A/B/C cars in the United States.  Other work related to these topics within the scope of this solicitation may be required, as the process of assessing these companies and the automotive sector generally unfolds.
 
It is anticipated that a very significant portion of the work in this engagement will be focused on critical assessments of the GM Restructuring plan and the Chrysler Alliance. In the case of GM, the Contractor must work closely with Treasury and, on behalf of Treasury, with GM to develop a viable, detailed operating and financial plan acceptable to the Government.  For the Chrysler Alliance, the Contractor must evaluate in detail a proposed Chrysler/Fiat operating plan, including the steps to reach integration and an assessment of the combined operations as well as thorough assessments of both Chrysler and Fiat.
