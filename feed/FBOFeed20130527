If so, who will cover the cost?<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE<br /></span><br />The manifest should be for the service per location per day. So if the contractor performs work at several facilities on Kadena in one day, that is one manifest. The Government requires the manifests for the month submitted together with the weight tickets once per month. The cost of the manifest is a cost of complying with local regulation so it should be included as a part of the contractor's overhead.
