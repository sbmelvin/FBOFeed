<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Division of Acquisition Management (DAM), intends to award a sole source, cost-reimbursement contract to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) of Washington, DC.  The contract will require ACOG to conduct annual site visits to designated DHHS/Indian Health Services (IHS) areas to provide professional consultation on women's health, conduct an accredited post-graduate OB/GYN course annually, and assist the IHS federally and tribally-operated facilities in obtaining board-certified fellows and/or board-eligible junior fellow obstetricians and gynecologists for three-week periods of time to provide relief physician coverage for the full-time physicians currently providing services in these facilities. ACOG will provide the physicians as requested by the IHS.  The Government knows of only one source, ACOG, who is adequately familiar with the unique demands placed upon the IHS Federal or Tribal OB/GYN health professionals and the variations, which occur amongst the several IHS federal or Tribal locations.  For over 30 years, ACOG has maintained a special Committee on American Indian Affairs comprised of present and former IHS OB/GYN physicians and ACOG consultants.  In addition, ACOG did extensive analysis of the IHS, which defines the requirements of maternal and infant care throughout the IHS.  This experience with Indian Health programs, coupled with expertise in the tracking and practice of clinical OB/GYN, gives ACOG the unique capability to conduct the activities that will be required by the resulting contract.  ACOG is exceedingly familiar with OB/GYN physicians throughout the United States, including Alaska, and is able to communicate and solicit the services of these individuals.  Since ACOG officially represents the national obstetrics and gynecologic professionals and organizations that are involved with such care, it is the only known organization that can serve in this capacity.  Pursuant to 41 USC 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, this requirement has been justified in accordance with FAR 6.303.  It is anticipated that the contract shall have a 12-month base period with four, 12-month option periods.  Interested parties who feel that they are capable of fulfilling this requirement may identify their interest by providing clear and comprehensive information supporting their claim, inclusive of references listing contact person(s) and phone number(s).  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all information received within 45 days of the publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within its discretion. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If no responses are received within 45 days, the Government shall negotiate and award a contract to ACOG.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-275 intends to award a Delivery Order on a Sole-Source basis under BOA N00019-05-G-0008 to Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (RTSC) to provide engineering services and products in the area of V-22 maintenance data ground stations.  This effort requires intricate knowledge of the diagnostic ground station used by the V-22 platform to support the first, major deployment for the MV-22, the stand up of additional MV-22 squadrons, and key program milestones such as the successful completion of the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) period for CV-22.  IOT&E began in October 2006 and is anticipated to be completed by May 2008.  RTSC is the only known source independent of the    V-22 prime contractor that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following efforts without significantly impacting schedule and cost constraints to the program.

V-22 Aircraft Maintenance Event Ground Station (AMEGS).  AMEGS is a ground station system that collects maintenance, vibration, failure, and engine data from the aircraft and uses that data to generate diagnostic information that can be utilized for aircraft data analysis, trending, and troubleshooting. RTSC designed, developed, tested and produced the AMEGS, and continues to implement new functionality.  RTSC will also continue to support and sustain the current AMEGS product to include interfaces with the Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management Information System (NALCOMIS) and the Air Force Integrated Maintenance Database System-Central Database (IMDS-CDB). RTSC will also continue to support the transition of further automating the maintenance data ground station toolset as a module within the Comprehensive Automated Maintenance Environment Optimized (CAMEO).  CAMEO is the enabling technology that will provide a complete suite of maintenance technical data, diagnostic information, aircraft fault data, and the associated interfaces between service-specific systems of records in one comprehensive toolset for the V-22 maintenance, engineering and logistics communities.

The Navy intends to award a Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee Delivery Order for this requirement.  The anticipated period of performance is 02 January 2008 through 31 December 2008.  The estimated issue date for this Order is 31 December 2007.  Services under current contract number N00421-02-D-3073 with Raytheon Technical Services Corporation expire 31 January 2008.  This synopsis is for information purposes only.

<DESC>The ATCOTS program seeks to improve the way FAA meets ATC training needs.  This performance work statement (PWS) establishes the scope of services to be provided by a single service provider (SP) under a performance-based contract. The FAA believes that by better leveraging private-sector resources it will be able to train controllers at a significantly reduced cost to the Government, more efficiently, and with improved performance in select training service parameters.  To that end, the FAA plans to award one performance-based service contract to provide lifecycle ATC technical training support as described in Section 3: Required Services. FAA's long-term priorities for this acquisition are as follows: 1.	Reduce the total cost and time to the FAA of all air traffic control technical training  2.	Leverage best practices and innovation to provide comprehensive training 3.	Develop flexible training that can be adapted to meet changing requirements, e.g., the introduction of new technologies and procedures  4.	Develop flexible training that can be adapted around candidate competencies.

<DESC>Introduction<br/>
<br/>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  <br/>

<br/>The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has a requirement for establishing large scale, coordinated Systems Biology Programs that utilize a combination of computational and experimental methodologies to conduct research Projects to analyze, identify, quantify, model and predict the overall dynamics of the network of cellular molecular components of microbial organisms and their interactions with the host cells.<br/>
Description<br/> 

<br/>Each research Project of the Systems Biology Program shall concurrently utilize multiple high-throughput ?-omics? technologies to generate a diversity of experimental data. These experimental data shall be collected and integrated to develop and/or validate computational models of the molecular interaction networks involved in the biological processes under investigation.<br/>  

<br/>The resources generated by the System Biology Program shall be made publicly available and easily accessible to the scientific community through public data, software and reagent repositories and through web portals The ultimate goal of the Systems Biology Program is to enhance knowledge of the overall complexity of the biological, biochemical and biophysical molecular processes in microbial organisms and host cells which may lead to the initiation and progression of infectious diseases. Such information should identify novel, unique, as well as common molecular signatures that may represent future targets for intervention and could aid in the identification of emerging pathogens and in the development of antimicrobial drugs, immunotherapies, vaccines and diagnostics for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, thus potentially translating basic research findings into clinical applications.<br/>

<br/>It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about September 15, 2008. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows:  10.45 FTEs.<br/>

<br/>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This BAA will be available electronically on/about August 15, 2007, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>Western Area Power Administration intends to acquire, on a sole source basis, stringing blocks under the authority FAR 6.302-1. Western believes Sherman & Reilly, Inc is the only known source that can provide these Blocks. These specific stringing blocks are needed and required for a number of reasons: 1) the maximum working load of 12,000 pounds is necessary to accommodate our larger diameter, tighter strung conductors, 2) the extra wide throat is critical in order to have the gaitor (OPGW stringing) easily pass through the stringing block, and 3) convenience features of lighter weight, neoprene lined and having the block support the wire when the gate is open makes these units very efficient and effective for our stringing operation. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilty to satisfy the Government's requirements by emailing or faxing the Contract Specialist at 701-221-4526. Capabilty statements must include documentation ability to satisfy the Government's requirements. Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Notice of Intent ? Sole Source

The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a single source follow-on commercial contract to Beckman Coulter Inc.  The requirement is to continue with a cost per test contract to include 3 analyzers, (2) HMX and (1) LH 750, for the hospital laboratory for a base plus four option years.  In addition to the analyzers we will purchase supplies and reagents.  Beckman Coulter will provide equipment repairs, warranted replacements parts, preventive maintenance and all software upgrades as they become available.  Beckman Coulter regents and controls are assayed specifically per instrument.  Mixing lots from various companies would result in differing test results, negating the validation studies conducted.  In order to troubleshoot any diagnostic problem, service technicians are only familiar with Beckman Coulter products.  Therefore, it is essential to use a single source to supply the analyzers and reagents, supplies and controls. The current equipment underwent extensive correlation and calibration testing at the time it was installed.  The duplication of effort and cost that would be incurred by bringing in new equipment and reperforming correlation and calibration testing is not considered of benefit to the government.   The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.  

Any company that feels they can meet the requirements as stated above without impact to the current operation of the hospital must submit their technical data (2 pages or less) to support their claim no later than 8 August 2007.  The information must explain the company?s ability to overcome duplicate correlation and calibration testing and issues with mixing lots.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

Point of Contact is Ronnie Wilkinson, Contract Specialist (719) 333-2965 email: (ronnie.wilkinson@usafa.af.mil) or Leslie Ryan, Contracting Officer (719) 333-3961 email: leslie.ryan@usafa.af.mil

5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) or FAR 6.302-1 with Digital Receiver Technology Inc, 20250 Century Blvd, Suite 300, Germantown, MD 20874 for the purchase of the following items: 

ITEM 1: Digital Exciter Module
QTY: 1
P/N: DRT1000/DEX1
DESCRIPTION: Digital exciter module (DEX) card for wireless receiver system. Generates 24 narrowband digital signals output to backplane interface connector. 14 bit data output at 70 MHz rate in several software selectable modulation formats. Single 3U size compact PCI slot.

ITEM 2: Power Amplifier
QTY: 1
P/N: DRT 9955B-1TRAM
DESCRIPTION: Transmit and receive amplifier module which works in conjunction with TEX and DEX modules for active interrogation. Module is portable and ruggedized. Operates from DC power supply or AC with provided adapter. Contains necessary internal amplification and filtering to ensure maximum operating range and receiver sensitivity while in presence of colocated transmitter. Simultaneous dual band operation or single band operation with DF. Transmits 869 to 894 MHz, Chainsaw and 1930 to 1960 MHz. Receives 824 to 849 MHz, Chainsaw and 1850 to 1910 MHz. 15 watts RF output power on GSM850 and Chainsaw bands, 8 watts on PCS1900 band. All SMA connectors except Transmit Output which is N.

Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 334220.

Sole Source Justification

AFRL/IFEC has existing DRT systems in use for research and development under in house efforts such as Network Centric Exploitation and Tracking (NCET) and Simulated Communications (SIMCOMM). The new modules must interact with the existing equipment due to proprietary software programming and interface logic between the software and hardware. If another system were to be procured for use with the existing DRT software and hardware, the Government would incur an inordinate amount of effort and cost to design and configure software and software to hardware interfaces. To use another brand system would require extensive research, testing, and development to achieve compatibility. The proposed source, Digital Receiving Technology, is the only known source that can manufacture and distribute the modules which to work in conjunction with the DRT wireless receiving system in possession of the Government.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) or FAR 6.302-1 with Raytheon Company, 1801 W Hughes Drive, Fullerton CA 92833-2200 for the purchase of six (6) MicroLight Receiver Transmitters; six (6) MicroLight Antennas; six (6) Cable Assemblies; and one (1) Network Manager V4.4.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 334220.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:     

AFRL/IFGC requires these items for several projects including XG (Next Generation) and DTN (Disruption Tolerant Networking). This equipment is required to seamlessly integrate with the ten intact Microlight Radios in use by the ground forces for DTN. In order for AFRL to communicate and network with the ground forces the same radio is required due to the proprietary technology that enables the networking. If another type of radio were purchased, AFRL would not be able to communicate with the ground forces for DTN and thus certain experiments would be unable to function. Additionally, AFRL/IFGC needs to field the radios to verify that there are not any interference issues with the XG radios. The MicroLight radio is capable of fully function in a MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network). The MicroLight radio is only manufactured and distributed by the Raytheon Company.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. It is anticipated that the period of performance of the award will be one year. The main objectives of this contract are:

a)	Collaborate with FDA on implementation of sequential analytic methods for active flu safety surveillance.
b)	Expand understanding of the benefits and limitations of comparison group selection and event definitions for active flu safety surveillance.
c)	Evaluation of claims patterns for selected events (e.g., vaccines, drugs, procedures, labs, diagnostic studies) of interest.

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, and facilities, and otherwise do all things necessary for or incident to the performance of the work described in the statement as follows:
 DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The primary goal of this project is to build upon and expand on activities undertaken as part of a previous FDA and CDC collaborative pandemic flu study and other FDA sponsored flu activities, including evaluating adverse events after influenza vaccination among the elderly using Medicare data. The following describe in greater detail the activities and deliverables for each of the above objectives of the study.
d)	Task 1. Collaborate with FDA on implementation of sequential analytic methods for active flu safety surveillance. This task will involve collaboration with Harvard on the use of sequential analytic methods for active flu vaccine safety surveillance, specifically use of the maximized sequential probability ratio test (maxSPRT). The maxSPRT was developed by the Vaccine Safety Datalink project researchers, including Dr. Martin Kulldorffi, as a refinement of the sequential probability ratio test developed by Wald in 1945. This new statistical method involves periodic statistical analysis of data as they are collected.
The FDA is currently working with CMS to conduct flu vaccine safety surveillance using weekly data extracts from CMS, and FDA intends to continue this work with CMS during the 2007-08 flu season. Harvard will work closely with FDA to develop and describe the data structures necessary to analyze the weekly CMS data using the maxSPRT, collaborate with FDA on implementation of the statistical testing, and assist with interpretation of the findings and comparison to findings generated using the analytic methods currently employed by FDA.
Harvard will help FDA understand the data needs, benefits, and limitations of sequential analysis using the maxSPRT. The goal will be achieved through a series of face-to-face meetings and/or teleconferences to describe the methodology and by working closely with FDA on implementation of the methodology using the CMS data during the 2007-08 flu season.  

A series of teleconferences and written communications between Harvard and FDA will describe the new sequential methodology and active collaboration will provide the opportunity for potential implementation of the methodology using the CMS data stream. Deliverables will include draft and final data structures necessary to analyze CMS data using the maxSPRT.

e)	Task 2. Expand understanding of the benefits and limitations of comparison group selection and event definitions for active flu safety surveillance. This task will involve two main activities. The first activity will be to describe the benefits, limitations, and considerations of various potential comparison groups and event definitions when conducting real-time flu vaccine safety surveillance. The selection of a comparison group is complex in any safety surveillance study, but is heightened in flu vaccine safety due to factors that include the potential for widespread exposure to the vaccine, the need for real-time information, seasonality, differences in vaccines across years, and variability in flu severity. Selection of an appropriate comparison group or groups is essential for interpretation of the real-time safety data. Potential comparison groups include concurrent exposed or unexposed individuals, historical exposed or unexposed individuals, and population based estimates.  

The second activity for this task will be to use the previously generated summary data from i3. These data include a single definition for each event (e.g., inpatient GBS claim) and a single comparison group (exposed individuals during the prior flu season). However, we collected data that will allow evaluation of alternative event definitions (e.g., inpatient versus physician office diagnoses), various time windows for comparison (e.g., 1-42 days and 43-84 day before vaccination), and comparator groups, and we will assess how these alternative specifications affect study findings. Harvard will work with FDA to compare findings with a similar assessment tentatively planned by FDA using the CMS data.

The deliverable for this task is a report that describes the key benefits, limitations, and considerations of various potential comparison groups and event measures when conducting real-time flu vaccine safety surveillance in both databases when feasible. The report will include the findings of new analyses using the data developed during the prior flu vaccine safety study.  

f)	Task 3. Evaluation of claims patterns for selected events (e.g., vaccines, drugs, procedures, labs, diagnostic studies) of interest. For this task, Harvard will work with FDA to select a set of 3 to 5 key outcomes (e.g., seizure, ataxia, anaphylaxis/allergic reaction, and paralytic syndrome) for flu safety surveillance and conduct a retrospective review of the automated claims associated with those outcomes. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care automated claims data will be used to describe the claims patterns of members with selected events to help improve our understanding of the expected patterns of care for those events within a managed care plan. Harvard will work with FDA to compare findings with a similar assessment tentatively planned by FDA using the CMS data. The goal of this task is to better understand the expected patterns of care for selected events, thereby improving our ability to define those events more precisely using claims data. This task will employ only automated data; chart abstraction will not be possible within the scope of work. The deliverable for this task will be a report describing the patterns of care for health plan members with selected events and suggestions for improving event definitions based on automated claims data.

The deliverables called for under the contract shall be provided according to the schedule set forth therein. NO REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) IS AVAILABLE. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services no later than 3pm eastern standard time on August 15, 2007 to Dominique.Malone @fda.hhs.gov. A determination to compete this procurement based on  responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. NOTE: Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423, or by accessing the CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov/. Respondents will not be notified of the government?s decision. This announcement does not bind the government to a particular acquisition method. All responses or questions regarding this posting must be in writing and can be sent via email to Dominique.Malone@fda.hhs.gov. No phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), Toxicology and Environmental Information Program (TEHIP) to license additions to the Consumer Product Information Database (CPID), on a sole source basis, from DeLima Associates, 1227 Providence Terrace, Suite L2, McLean, VA  22101-2648.  The CPID is a database that provides product brand names and their chemical ingredients, plus data from the manufacturers'MSDS, Material Safety Data Sheets, when available.  The purpose of this procurement is to acquire non-exclusive rights to use 1,000 additional products and updates to the Consumer Product Information Database.

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541511 and the business size standard is $23.0.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  NLM anticipates that award will be made on or about August 16, 2007. The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from the effective date of award with three (3) one year options.

BACKGROUND
The primary mission of TEHIP is to provide core information resources and services, facilitate access to national and international information resources, and strengthen the infrastructure for toxicology and environmental health information. In support of this mission, the Program makes available on the web a suite of databases containing both factual and bibliographic information on environmental and health effects of chemicals.

The advent of the web technology made it possible for TEHIP to extend the reach of its existing databases by hyperlinking to other information resources in and outside of the government. Moreover, the web technology helped to make its information resources easily available not only to its traditional users such as toxicologists, industrial hygienists, healthcare providers, and regulatory specialists, but also to the public at large seeking information about the effects of exposures to chemical substances. 

REQUIREMENTS 
1. New Data to be Provided:
DeLima Associates will provide information for an additional 1,000 products. The following types of information will be provided:
- Brand Name, Ingredient Chemicals by Name and Registry Number
- Health Effects from Material Safety Data Sheets
- Customer Service Telephone Number
- Manufacturer?s Name, Address, Telephone Number and List of 
  Other Products in Database by the Same Manufacturer

2.Updating of Previously Supplied Data
New Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) will be obtained from manufacturers of the previously supplied products. Ingredients, health effects and contact information will be updated using the new MSDSs as needed.

DELIVERABLES
1. New Products in categories identified and prioritized by NLM.
Data for 500 new products in categories identified and prioritized by NLM will be provided within 6 months of work initiation date.

Data for additional 500 new products will be provided within 12 months of work 	initiation date.  

2. Updates of Product Data 
Data for half of the existing products will be updated as needed within 6 months of work initiation date. Data for remaining existing products will be updated as needed within 12 months of work initiation date.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION
Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302, DeLima Associates is the only known source that is capable of fulfilling this requirement.  In order for TEHIP to further their mission the capabilities provided by the DSOL database is needed.  DeLima Associates has delivered its Consumer Product Information Database, which contains chemical and health effects data for over 6,000 common household products, to NLM. The database is unique in that for the first time, it compiles in one place, brand names of household products, and identifies, for each brand name, its chemical ingredients by chemical name and the chemical's universal identifier, the CAS Registry Number. This linking of brand names to individual chemical ingredients will be a valuable addition to the existing TEHIP files which currently contain a wealth of health data on exposure to individual chemicals, but provides no way to translate this information to specific brand name consumer products. 

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, if any interested party believes it has the capability to fulfill the above requirement; it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NLM to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 PM EDT August 15, 2007.   Faxed capability statements are NOT authorized.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Robin Hope-Williams at rhwilli@mail.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.   In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

BACKGROUND
The National Library of Medicine (NLM), Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) offers a variety of toxicology information to the public through the World Wide Web.  This information takes the form of bibliographic files such as TOXLINE and data files such as the Hazardous Substances Databank (HSDB).  Most files are not structured in such a way that a symptom developed in the workplace such as ?rash? can be tracked back to a given chemical or chemical class and/or type of job.  Haz-Map created by Dr. Jay Brown is such a database and it provides linkage between symptoms, jobs, and chemicals.  Specialized Information Services Division wishes to provide access to information in Haz-Map.  The experimental Haz-Map web site was made available to the public in May 2002 and since then the file has been updated and the web interface has been refined.

1. Update the data in Haz-Map for completeness and compatibility with the SIS suite of databases.
2. Provide a list of core journals that are used for updating the content of the file and search PubMed for relevant information.
3. Provide Internet sources of relevant images for diseases and findings.
4. Enhance the job table by adding information on cancer risk.  This information can be added in a new field.
5. Consider ways for including new jobs not classified in the SOC code.
6. Add or modify information as needed.

A monthly progress report is required.  The progress report should include documentation of all changes, additions and deletion to the database.  Deliverables include an updated database of Haz-Map.  The NLM Project Officers will assign tasks, and work will be reviewed for completeness and timeliness.  

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302, Dr. Jay Brown is the only known source that is capable of fulfilling this requirement.  Dr. Brown is uniquely qualified to offer these services.  He is the originator and sole author of Haz-Map and makes it available to NLM as a public resource.  Dr. Brown holds M.D. and M.P.D. degree and is Board Certified in Occupational Medicine by the American Board of Preventive Medicine and has over ten years of experience working in occupational medicine clinics.  In order for NLM/SIS to continue to further their mission, the capabilities provided by Dr. Brown and Haz-Map is needed.

However, if any interested party believes it has the capability to fulfill the above requirement; it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria:  1) Key personnel must have earned a MD degree, Master in Public Health and be Board Certified in Occupational Medicine (35%); 2) experience in formatting developing and maintaining biomedical relational databases and the ability to assemble, organize, analyze and disseminate a variety of biomedical materials in electronic environment for the use of public domain (25%); 3) ability to demonstrate extensive working knowledge and experience working with medical literature and chemical information regulations (20%); 4) key personnel must have a least 5 years experience in occupational medicine clinics and an extensive working knowledge of them (20%).

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center, on behalf of the U.S. Access Board, has the need for a Contractor to research and report on the range of different methods used by States to implement and enforce accessibility requirements in state building codes or other accessibility codes.  The focus of this project is to identify states that have adopted innovative models of accessibility compliance that are proactive rather than punitive.  Unique models may include: specially designated staff or contractor programs to conduct plans review and on-site inspections; focused training in accessibility; professional credentialing for accessibility specialists or building officials; a uniquely qualified body to resolve questions of interpretation or other accessibility-related enforcement matters; or other approaches.  The project should provide a detailed review of each model.   

Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  Environmental Protection Agency -  Regional Laboratory.  This sole source justification is for the purchase of a speciation kit with HPLC and the necessary corresponding units.   II. STATEMENT OF FACTS JUSTIFYING SOLE SOURCE AWARD:  The equipment that will be purchased is to be used with existing equipment owned by the EPA. It is  necessary to keep the same manufacturer for the proper function and communication between existing equipment, and to keep from voiding the existing manufacturer's warranty.  No other manufacturer's equipment will communicate with the existing equipment.  Use of other brand name speciation kits  would require extensive duplicate costs to EPA. The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that possesses equipment, and upgraded Perkin Elmer parts that will function and communicate with our existing Perkin Elmer.  This unique equipment is essential for contract performance because no  other manufacturer's equipment will function and communicate with the Perkin Elmer equipment.  Also, no other vendor is authorized to distribute these speciation kits. III. Perkin Elmer is the only known source able to satisfy the Government's requirement(s).  Perkin Elmer is the manufacturer of  the equipment and they are the only company that offers the required speciation kit. IV. STATEMENT OF ACTIONS TAKEN TO PRECLUDE THE NECESSITY FOR FUTURE SOLE SOURCE ACQUISITION FOR THE SAME SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  This acquisition is for upgrades to an existing system.  Manufacturers of similar  speciation systems may have the ability to compete for future acquisitions of complete systems.

<b><u>Port and Maritime Sector Monitoring and Control Center</b></u>
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Port and Maritime Sector Monitoring and Control Center.

AMP is an autonomous government agency established in 1998 to unify the maritime responsibilities of the National Port Authority; the Directorate of Vessels and Consular Affairs within the Ministry of Treasury and Finance; the Directorate of Marine Resources within the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Nautical School of Panama within the Ministry of Education.

The Government of Panama (GOP) is interested in implementing security measures which meet international maritime trade security standards. These international security initiatives include 24-hour manifests, Container Security Initiative (CSI), Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), the International Maritime Organization's International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code), International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), Long Range Identification and Tracking Systems (LRIT), Ship Security Alert System (SSAS) and Vessel Monitoring Services (VMS).  The implementation of the Center would help AMP to manage the compliance of the entire Panamanian maritime sector with these international security standards while more effectively, efficiently and safely processing the increasing volume of commercial cargo and vessel traffic in the principal ports of Balboa, Col?n and Crist?bal.

Installation and training included.

Meso Scale Discovery provides a platform that is unique in that it eliminates the burdens imposed by fluidic analyzers. All precursor technologies require pumps and tubes that the beads must flow through.

Instead of a fixed electrode mounted in a flow cell (that the beads pass through), the electrode is in the 96well plate bottom.  The disposable carbon ink electrode is printed using precision lithography like flat panel displays. Meso Scale Discovery offers state of the art detection technology, providing the only instrument that combines electrochemiluminescence in a multiplexing platform. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES.  However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures a firm fixed price purchase order to Michael Chernew, Ph.D., Department of Health Care Policy, 180 Longwood Avenue, Boston,  MA 02115.  The purpose of this contract is to obtain the consultation services of Dr. Michael Chernew for the purpose of assisting the National Health Statistics Group?s (NHSG), Office of the Actuary (OACT) efforts to develop models to project health spending over the next 75 years and beyond.  The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 requires the Medicare Trustees Report to report 75-year projections of Medicare spending relative to National Health Expenditures (NHE) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  The National Health Statistics Group (NHSG) continues to work on development of models to project national health spending over this period.  The contractor will assist NHSG in evaluation of the strengths/weaknesses of these models, determination of their appropriateness for use in the Medicare Trustees Report, determination of methodologies for merging alternative approaches, and helping to set the direction for future model development and refinement efforts.  In addition, the contractor will help NHSG coordinate reviews of these models from other experts and synthesize their input into one set of recommendations.  Dr. Michael Chernew, is a renowned expert in health economics and long-run projections.  For the past year Dr. Chernew served as a consultant with NHSG/OACT concerning long run health modeling involving the same issues and many of the same models that will figure in the new contract.  Dr. Chernew has unique knowledge of the issues surrounding long-run projections of health spending.  His experience includes serving as a member on each of the last two Medicare Technical Panels that advised the Medicare Trustees on long-run health spending assumptions.  Members of this Panel are approved based on their qualifications by the Medicare Trustees.  Dr. Chernew has published articles on this topic, including an article in Health Affairs entitled ?Increased Spending on Health Care: How Much Can the United States Afford??  He recently served on an advisory panel convened by HHS to evaluate the computable general equilibrium long-run projections produced by CMS.  In addition, Dr. Chernew has published numerous articles on topics such as the HMO insurance market, Medicare+Choice, modeling health insurance coverage, and the relationship of quality and employers? choice of health plans in renown journals such as the Journal of Health Economics, Medical Care, Archives of Internal Medicine, Inquiry, and Medical Care Research and Review.  He is also co-editor of the American Journal of Managed Care.   He is currently a professor at Harvard University, where his efforts are focused on health care cost growth and benefit plan design.  He was previously at the University of Michigan where he was a professor in the Department of Health Management and Policy, Department of Economics, and Department of Internal Medicine.  Dr. Chernew?s unique qualifications from an experience and educational standpoint make it unnecessary to consider another person for this contract. Any other contractor would also have to expend significant effort to develop in-depth knowledge of CMS\OACT long run modeling efforts with which Dr. Chernew is already conversant. It would be a hardship to the agency to consider anyone else for this work.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>Presolicitation for Contractor to Administer the 2008 Point-of-Sale Facilitated Enrollment (POS FE) Process for the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program

Description:

Contracting Office Address Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Office of Acquisition and Grants Management, Acquisition and Grants Group, Division of Beneficiary Support Contracts, 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21244 Description

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking to award a contract, under full and open competition, to a national Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) Sponsor to administer the POS FE process.  The POS FE process provides immediate Part D prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries who are also Medicaid eligible or LIS eligible, but not yet enrolled in a Part D plan.  The purpose of this contract is for the contracted plan to pay claims for eligible beneficiaries.  Following a post-adjudicative screening against State Medicaid eligibility systems to verify Medicaid eligibility by another CMS contractor, the sponsor would enroll those beneficiaries identified as dual/LIS eligible into an appropriate Part D plan and attempt to collect claim costs for those who were ruled out as ineligible for the process.  

Requirements:  

CMS will compete this requirement among those contractors that meet the following criteria:

1.	Be a PDP Sponsor under contract with CMS in both 2007 and 2008;
2.	Have in each PDP region (excluding U.S. Territories) a plan benefit package (PBP) with a basic benefit and a premium at or below the 2008 region-specific low-income premium subsidy amount (including a $1.00 per month de minimis amount);
3.	Have the capacity to adjudicate claims at the point-of-sale for individuals claiming to be full-benefit dual eligibles or other LIS eligibles, with no Part D plan enrollment, who present at the POS with an immediate prescription drug need;
4.	Have the capacity to contract with the CMS TrOOP Facilitator contractor to perform front end edits on claims submitted by pharmacists to the POS FE contractor for purposes of rejecting claims for lack of Medicare Part D eligibility or the presence of other Part D plan enrollment
5.	Have the capacity to partner with a CMS Eligibility Verification contractor who will query State Medicaid eligibility verification systems on those beneficiaries who pass the POS FE front end edits but whose dual or LIS eligible status is unknown; 
6.	Have the ability to establish connectivity with CMS and its designated contractors within 6-8 weeks of the award date of the contract;
7.	Have the ability to submit enrollment to CMS within 7 calendar days of confirmation of POS FE from CMS or CMS's contractor; and
8.	Have the ability to notify beneficiaries whose eligibility for POS FE cannot be confirmed and collect claim costs from them if they cannot subsequently establish dual or LIS eligibility.

All PDPs who anticipate meeting criterion #2 above and who meet all other listed criteria, are invited to submit a proposal to the RFP (when posted) for consideration by the Agency.  (Actual ability to meet criterion #2 will not be known for certain until mid-August when the low-income premium subsidy amount is announced)

Period of performance will be one fifteen-month base period (three months for transition and twelve months of operations) beginning September 28, 2007 through December 31, 2008.  

This procurement is subject to the availability of funds.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services Measuring prediagnostic levels of Measure IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP-3, and TGF-B1 and risk of pancreatic cancer with Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, 3999 Chemin Cote Sainte Catherine, Montreal Quebec, Canada.  

This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items/services as authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR 13.106.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M.  

The purpose of this procurement is to conduct assays to measure the serum levels of IGF-1, IGF-2, IGF BP-3 in up to 627 pancreatic cancer cases and controls from the Prostate Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) study.  Specifically, the contractor shall: 1) Measure IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP-3 on ~627 PLCO stored serum samples ? Serum concentrations of IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGFBP-3 will be assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with reagents from Diagnostic Systems Laboratory (Webster, TX); 2) Measure TGF-B1 on n=210 samples in a pilot study to determine the reliability of the assay.  If the assays are deemed reliable, TGF-B1 may be measured in the 627 PLCO stored serum samples - Serum concentrations of TGF-B1 will be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a commercially available ELISA kit (Quantikine R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).  

The biomarker measurements may be pooled with other pancreatic cancer studies that have used the laboratory of Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research to measure IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGFBP-3.    NCI investigators have analyzed specimens from the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Study cohort to investigate the relationship of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 and have used this laboratory to measure these analytes (Stolzenberg-Solomon, 2004).  As an NCI study regarding pancreatic cancer is included in this consortium of pancreatic cancer studies, the measurement of these analytes will be comparable to that of other current pancreatic studies for pooling information for current and future research.   Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research is the only source known to the NCI that can provide current measurement for ongoing and future studies regarding pancreatic cancer.  Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the current research in progress.

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm ET on August 16, 2007 to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) www.orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The Department intends to issue a purchase order to ProQuest-CSA LLC- Serials Solutions, 300 North Zeeb Road, PO Box 1346, Ann Arbor , Michigan 48106-1346 for subscription, to management services for electronic resources with Ulrich's Serials Analysis system and Ulrichsweb.com and centralized searching for one year; all services are hosted by Serials Solutions and are proprietary. This subscription is to provide access to management services for electronic resources with Ulrich's Serials Analysis system and Ulrichsweb.com and centralized searching of all journal subscriptions and databases subscribed to by the National Library of Education.  Providing a central location within the Federal Government for information about education and providing comprehensive reference services on matters related to education to employees of the Department of Education and its contractors and grantees, other Federal employees, and members of the public.


Currently Serials Solutions provides the Library with three critical management tools for journals in one coordinated package--Open URL Link Resolver-Article Linker and Full MARC Records Service. This service includes comprehensive MARC records for the Library's e-journal collection; Article Linker which is a full-feature OpenURL link resolver that seamlessly links all of the Library?s resources so customers can get to content quickly and efficiently; and E-Journal AMS (Access and Management Suite) which allows implementation of the E-Journal Portal, with subject browsing, title searching, and a dynamically generated A-to-Z list.  The Library will use this resource to improve customer service for all ED staff at their desktop, as well as to manage the Library's journals collection efficiently and effectively.  The Library subscribes to no other similar service.  This Serials Solutions suite of services operates on proprietary software; Serials Solutions, Inc. is the sole provider.	 New enhancements include Ulrich's Serials Analysis System, which will allow the Library to compare its serials holdings with similar institutions and therefore, evaluate specific subject areas within the collection and Ulrichsweb.com which is a basic library reference tool that identifies and describes current journal titles worldwide. Because these subscriptions are serviced by ProQuest?CSA LLC- Serials Solutions Division, it  is unique to them; they are uniquely qualified to perform the needed work and is the only source that will satisfy ED's requirement. All responsible sources, however, may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division intends to contract on a SOLE SOURCE basis with California Instruments Corp. of San Diego, CA, under the authority of FAR 13.5, for the procurement of three (3) 135 kVA, MX135-3Pi-MB-704 programmable AC/DC power supply systems that are compatible with the Navy?s existing 45 kVA, MX45-3Pi-704 programmable AC/DC power systems in order to create up to 180 kVA of programmable electrical power.   The 135 kVA system shall support the creation of the following multiple test support configurations: three (3) 45 kVA, one (1) 90 kVA with a designated master and auxiliary chassis plus a stand alone 45 kVA or one (1) 135 kVA system.  The breakdown of the kVA from 45 kVA to 180 kVA allows for the capability to provide a minimum power output, to conduct avionics tests in a mobile test laboratory with weight restrictions, as well as provide full generation capability of 180 kVA of the aircraft electrical system on a Hawkeye E2D and a P-8A.  

Parallel and programmable electric power is required to maintain the existing library, which utilizes Graphical User Interface (GUI) to perform MIL-STD-704 tests, for both utilization equipment and power injection on whole aircraft.  In addition to the purchase of the 3 new units, one (1) existing 45 kVA will be returned to California Instruments for calibration with the new 135 kVA to allow power output of up to 180 kVA support.  California Instruments is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the current power systems being utilized in the MIL-STD-704 Laboratory and which are programmed to reproduce MIL-HDBK-704 testing transients and waveforms.  No other known source units exist which are compatible in parallel to the existing OEM units.   No RFQ is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement, to include descriptive literature, within three (3) days of this announcement to the contact person listed above.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) intends to acquire a Telecommunications Link From Sand Island, Midway Atoll.

Introduction
The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a United States Federal agency dedicated to understanding and predicting changes in the Earth?s environment and to conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet Unites States economic, social, and environmental needs.  NOAA is the steward of national coastal and marine environments. In coordination with federal, state, local, tribal and international authorities, NOAA manages the use of these environments, regulating fisheries and marine sanctuaries as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species.

The National Marine Sanctuary Program (NMSP), established in 1972 by the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) and administered by NOAA, protects a network of 13 special marine and freshwater areas.  The goal of the NMSA is to set aside and manage areas for resource protection, research, enhanced public education, and compatible public and private uses.  Management activities for each sanctuary are detailed in site-specific management plans which outline regulatory goals, describe boundaries, and identify staffing and budget needs, set priorities and performance measures for resource protection, research, and education programs.

In 2001, NOAA initiated a process to consider designating the waters surrounding the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) as a National Marine Sanctuary. On June 15, 2006, George Bush established the Papah?naumoku?kea Marine National Monument (Monument) by Proclamation 8031 to ensure the comprehensive, strong, and lasting protection of the coral reef ecosystem and related marine resources and species of the region. These waters contain a large portion of all coral reefs found in the United States? jurisdiction and support more than 7,000 marine species, of which one quarter are unique to the Hawaiian Islands chain.  The 1200-mile stretch of remote islands, atolls and reefs, is also the most remote archipelago in the world. 

At a time when ocean resources around the world are in major decline, the designation of the Monument enabled nearly 140,000 square miles of the region to receive the highest form of marine environmental protection in the United States, creating the largest protected marine area in the world. 


Telecommunications Link From Sand Island, Midway Atoll
The Monument is looking to install telecommunications capacity from Sand Island, Midway Atoll for the purposes of telepresence, live video feeds, and web site updates. The Monument is tasked with bringing the wonders of this unique place to the people of the world as opposed to bringing people to the Monument, and access to the Monument is necessarily limited to protect its special habitats and wildlife.  One way to bring the place to the people is through telepresence.  Using technologies such as virtual field trips, web cameras, video reports from the field, and virtual classrooms, the Monument proposes to bring the unique flora, fauna, and habitats of Midway Atoll into classrooms and households across the world.  In developing capacity to meet this aim, careful attention will need to be paid to not have any impact upon the wildlife and their habitats.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service currently has a 9 M dish antennae on island that it uses for satellite uplink, and this dish will be used for this contract.

Scope of Work

Provide proposal for high-speed internet and data connection from Midway Atoll.

Provide equipment and services capable of establishing a high speed connection (at least T1, 1.544 MB/S) to the public Internet from Sand Island, Midway Atoll (Latitude:, 28?12'13"N (28.203671). Longitude:, 177?22'46"W (-177.379519). A full duplex connection is desirable since we will be using video conferencing technology.

The link should have the capacity to be scaled up, down, activated and deactivated on a minimum of a monthly cycle.  We will only need the full T1 capacity three months out of the year, and need either a diminished capacity, or not need the link at all during the rest of the year.  A link that provides a pay per use feature as opposed to a regular monthly fee (always on) connection is strongly preferred.

Contractor will provide and configure equipment necessary for establishing, and maintaining the connection at each end (i.e. routers, and satellite modems).

The contractor will also provide equipment for hardware video compression/decompression so that the best possible video signal can be transmitted over the communications link.

Deliverables
Provide T1 (1.544 MB/s) or better Internet connection from Sand Island on Midway Atoll for three months.

Provide 256 KB/s Internet connection from Sand Island on Midway Atoll for one year.

Provide router, satellite modems at either end to maintain connection, as well as Internet security (firewall services) to prevent unauthorized access to equipment on Midway.

Provide hardware video compression/decompression equipment to maximize quality of video signal that can be transmitted over the satellite connection.

Provide installation and configuration services for the above.

The period of performance is from date of award through September 30, 2008. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Seattle, WA intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Washington State, Department of Fish and Wildlife for Gray?s River Juvenile Salmonid Monitoring.
The Grays River supports native chum, Chinook and coho salmon, and steelhead and cutthroat trout populations. Of these, chum, Chinook and coho salmon are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and have been identified as priority species for recovery efforts by the Lower Columbia Fish Recovery Board (LCFRB). The LCFRB was established to develop and implement a recovery plan for listed populations.  In December 2004, the State of Washington submitted the LCFRB Lower Columbia Salmon Recovery and Fish and Wildlife Subbasin Plan to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)?Fisheries to address the recovery of salmon and steelhead populations in this domain (LCFRB 2004). This plan is the primary document guiding salmon recovery efforts in the Lower Columbia Basin.  Chapter seven of the Subbasin Plan outlines research, monitoring, and evaluation needs for the recovery plan.  Juvenile salmonid monitoring is identified as a key component of the biological monitoring plan for Grays River salmonid populations and builds on the existing salmonid monitoring program in Washington?s Lower Columbia River domain. Grays River Chinook, coho, and chum populations have also been selected for abundance and freshwater productivity monitoring under the Framework for Monitoring Salmon Populations developed by the Governor's Forum on Monitoring Salmon Recovery and Watershed Health.  Recognizing that resources are insufficient to monitor every population, the framework selects representative populations for monitoring within each Major Population Group and Evolutionary Significant Unit. In addition, juvenile monitoring in the lower Grays River supports objectives/work elements outlined in the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) funded project entitled: Historic Habitat Opportunities and Food-Web Linkages of Juvenile Salmon in the Columbia River Estuary and Their Implications for Managing River Flows and Restoring Estuarine Habitat (Project # 200301000); specifically, Objective 5 to ?determine whether the responses of juvenile salmon species and life history types to a restoring wetland-habitat landscape in lower Grays River differ from salmon habitat-use patterns documented for the mainstem Columbia River estuary?.

In 2007-08, we will conduct a juvenile salmonid outmigrant trapping operation in the Lower Grays River between tidewater and the confluence of the West Fork Grays River. The primary biological objectives of this project are to characterize juvenile salmonid life history diversity and estimate juvenile salmonid outmigrant abundance in this subbasin. Juvenile monitoring will follow established protocols.  Traps will be installed prior to commencement of subyearling smolt migration beginning in late January/ early February 2008, fished through June 30, 2008 (Sharpe and Glaser 2006), and will be checked daily when fishing.  Trap site scoping & evaluation will be completed in the summer/fall of 2007. Figure 1 presents potential trapping locations identified to date. Due to the extremely dynamic nature of the Lower Grays River, final trap site selection may not occur until January 2008.  Trapping will most likely be conducted with a rotary screw trap; however, other trap types, including a scoop trap and/or fence weir, are also being considered. 
OBJECTIVES:
1.1	Life history diversity
The objective of 1.1 is to characterize life history diversity of juvenile salmonids trapped from the Grays River.  All juvenile salmonids captured will be identified to species, categorized as fry, parr, pre-smolt, or smolt, and enumerated.  Fork lengths, weights and (potentially) genetic tissue samples will be collected from a representative subsample of each week?s catch. Scale samples will also be collected weekly from a sub-sample of steelhead and cutthroat juveniles. Ages from these fish will be used in conjunction with fork length frequencies to determine age composition of outmigrants.  Genetic tissue samples will be archived with the WDFW genetics laboratory.  In addition to collecting biological data, a sub-sample of each week?s catch will be given an identifiable external mark to provide an indicator of estuary entry for use in estimating estuarine residency.  Weekly marks for each species will be coordinated with marks used for trap efficiency/ abundance estimates (objective 1.2), and with marked chum salmon releases from the Grays River Hatchery.  A subsample of Chinook, coho and steelhead outmigrants greater than 60 mm fork length may also be inserted with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags and/or Coded Wire Tags (CWT).  Final study design details pertaining to sampling, marking and tagging will be developed with the NOAA Estuary Project team leader.


1.2	 Abundance estimates
The objective of 1.2 is to develop abundance estimates for Chinook, chum, and coho salmon and steelhead and cutthroat trout outmigrants with 95% confidence intervals of +/- 25% or less of an unbiased point estimate. Captured smolts will be anesthetized, bio-sampled, and examined for tags or marks (Rawding and Cochran 2001).  Maiden (first capture) smolts will be batch marked with a unique mark, weekly.  A thorough development of marking protocols will be developed that coordinates marks needed for trap efficiency/abundance estimates and estuarine residency estimates (objective 1.1).   

Smolt yield will be estimated using trap efficiency methods (MacDonald and Smith 1980, Dempson and Stansbury 1991, Thedinga et al. 1994, Schwarz and Dempson 1994).  Since trap efficiencies may change in relation to stream flow (Cheng and Gillinant 2004), a stratified experimental design is proposed where juveniles are batch marked with a unique mark for every week, as possible.  The population estimates obtained using this type of experimental design are often referred to as a stratified Petersen or Darroch estimate (Darroch 1961, Arnason et al. 1996, Bannahaka et al 1997, Plante et al. 1998).

Chi-squared tests for complete mixing and equal proportions will be used to pool data into homogeneous periods for population estimates (Schwarz and Taylor 1998).  Final estimates will be developed using Darroch Analysis with Rank Reduction (DARR) developed by Bjorkstedt (2000) and later modified (Bjorkstedt 2005).  Data will be collected to address mark loss, survival, size selectivity, and closure.

 The period of performance is from date of award through September 30, 2008. The intended acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 234 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. 
This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The government reserves the right to solicit offers based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice, or issue a contract to the Washington State Fish and Wildlife without further notice. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206) 527-7166 attention to Melvin Fondue.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Seattle, WA has a requirement for Life-History, Residency, and Growth of Juvenile Chinook Salmon in the Columbia River Estuary and Lower Gray?s River, 2007-08. The period of performance is from date of award through June 30, 2008.

Salmonid otoliths are well suited for studies of life history, residency, and growth because they lay down daily growth rings that reflect the chemical concentrations of the ambient water the fish are living in (Fowler et al. 1995). Moreover, these concentrations are not subject to change and thus provide an archival record of the chemical composition of the waters the fish experience during their life cycle (Campana and Neilson 1985).  Consequently, if the habitats occupied possess distinguishable chemical signatures it is possible to determine fish growth and residency in each of area and also to describe life-history patterns.  A critically important transition made by juvenile anadromous salmonids occurs when they move from freshwater rearing areas into brackish or marine waters.  Fortuitously, the concentration of strontium (Sr), a close chemical analog of calcium (Ca) increases dramatically from freshwater to seawater. Researchers have used the difference in abundance of strontium to delineate when salmonids enter and start to rear in marine waters. Transects of anadromous salmonid otoliths, for instance, are characterized by low Sr/Ca ratios for periods of freshwater rearing and increased Sr/Ca ratios during periods of brackish and marine-water residency (Kalish 1990, Friedland et al. 1998, Zimmerman 2003).  In this study we will examine microchemistry profiles of otoliths from juvenile Chinook collected from two types of habitat, lower estuary locations with high salinities, and off-channel marsh locations that may not be subjected to salt-water intrusion. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  NOAA, National Marine Sanctuary located in Silver Spring, MD intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Nitrox Solutions Inc for a Water Cooled NITROX Compressor System . 

Background

I.  Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) and the National Marine Sanctuary Program (NMSP) are currently in the process of constructing a research vessel, R/V MANTA, to operate in the northwest Gulf of Mexico.  This vessel will serve as a multi-purpose research vessel with an emphasis on diving operations.  During the solicitation of the construction contract, it was decided that the Nitrox system currently owned by the FGBNMS would be used as the main dive compressor on this vessel.  Since that time, similar systems have proven to be a major safety hazard.  The combination of high oxygen content and air under high pressures has caused these systems to explode.  As this system will be operating in the hull of the vessel, 100 nm offshore, this creates an unreasonable risk.  The construction contract already covers the installation of a NITROX system but the system itself is to be government furnished.  

II.	Tasks

The FGBNMS and NMSP is seeking to purchase a water cooled NITROX system for installation on board R/V MANTA.

Dorian's Event Log Management Suite is designed to save on resources with automated approaches to our mandated auditing requirements.  The Dorian Event Management suite allows for automated event log collection, instant alarms activated and storage.  This is critical to ensure network integrity, over the last couple of years GFS-Charleston's network infrastructure has grown from approx... 200+ to over 900 workstations just in the Openet environment.  Each workstation is configured with the DS security template that requires the workstation to crash if the audit logs become full.  Event Archiver will ensure that workstations remain operational 24x7 by automatically archiving the logs and clearing the logs from the workstation before it reaches capacity.   It also will alert the system manager if any suspicious or malicious activity has penetrated any of the systems within the network.   Failure to maintain service would likely lead to an interruption in daily operations, resulting to harm to the Government. To meet the above requirements, RM/GFS requires the purchase of the items listed below manufactured by Dorian Software: •	(1) Event Log Management Suite (1000 Workstation Licenses) with Event Rover, Event Alarm, Event Archiver & Event Analyst •	(1 Year) Dorian Platinum Support Service Purchase of these workstation licenses and support will allow RM/GFS, Charleston, SC to maintain its mission critical service which is vital for the proper execution of RM/GFS’s responsibility to the financial community.  It is essential that this mission critical software maintenance remain uninterrupted in order to maintain the operational effectiveness of RM/GFS employees and contractors.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.253(c) (1), as set forth by FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source”.  There are no actions that the Department may take to overcome future barriers to competition for this requirement.  This is due to the stringent requirements that are placed to ensure the security and integrity of the Department of State Networks as well as the server and workstation infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>AMENDMENT  2 A0002 is issued to Extend the closing date to August 10, 2007 at 12:00 noon Eastern Standard Time and Answer Questions that were received. 
Question 1 -  Are the terms ?unit? and ?regions? interchangeable?  
Answer 1 - Yes 
Question 2 - Does the contract price of $75K to $100K include travel? 
Answer 2 - The total contract is not to exceed $100K.  Therefore, if travel is required, that should be included in the overall quote of $100K. 
Question 3 - How are the four half-day planning sessions, the two courses, and the six half-day follow-up sessions for each unit/region scheduled?  In other words, would the four planning sessions for the October training (Asia) be scheduled for the first week in October, the courses for the second week, and the follow-up sessions for the third week? 
Answer 3 - The planning sessions and courses should happen in the same month.  The follow-up sessions can be scheduled by the unit at any time during the period of performance.  The follow-up sessions are meant to reinforce lessons taught in the courses and to address any new issues that arise. 
Question 4 -  Is there a specific number of days required for each course?  Is a three-day course acceptable? 
Answer 4 - Yes, a three day course is acceptable.  However, Office Directors will approve course content in advance.  Therefore, that may result in the class being shortened.

<SUBJECT>D -- Navy - Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA)
<SOLNBR>N00019-07-R-0060
<RESPDATE>063007
<ARCHDATE>09142007
<CONTACT>Melanie Bateman, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-6572, Fax 301-757-9039, Email Melanie.Bateman@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is announcing the upcoming release of the Military Flight Operations Qualification Assurance (MFOQA) solicitation. This acquisition is being pursued on the basis of full and open competition and provides for the procurement of MFOQA Software, an Enterprise Licensing Agreement, maintenance and support for the Enterprise Agreement, training materials, and engineering support services. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210, Software Publishers.  The basis for award of the resultant contract will be best value to the Government. Evaluation factors for award and relative importance thereof will be identified in the forthcoming Request for Proposal (RFP).   Contract award is anticipated in the first quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 08.

The Department of the Navy (DON) will implement a Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) Program, based in part on the highly successful Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) Program.  While both programs use digital flight data, downloaded routinely post-flight, to conduct detailed trend and analysis of aircraft and aircrew performance the DON MFOQA program differs from FOQA as all data analysis and replay can be accomplished at multiple levels within the Naval Aviation Enterprise.  Potential benefits are estimated to be significant in improving Operational Readiness, Training, Maintenance Management and Safety.  MFOQA will provide a proactive means to highlight positive trends and to identify potential risks in time for corrective action.  

MFOQA will differ from FOQA in several critical areas.  A single DON MFOQA software product must be capable of supporting fixed-wing, rotary wing, and tilt-rotor aircraft in both home-based and deployed environment.  The FOQA Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software chosen for procurement to support the MFOQA program must be an Open Architecture product and readily adaptable to fulfilling the following general requirements specific to MFOQA:

Post-mission Debrief:  MFOQA will require routine, post-flight debriefing for aircrews, consisting of electronic visualization and event analysis of the specific mission.  This replay capability will be necessary on multiple, server-based workstations throughout DON shore and ship-based organizations.  COTS visualization products must support National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) products, as well as military-specific animation models of aircraft, cockpit, runways, etc.  

Maintenance Analysis:  A routine post-flight maintenance-focused electronic debrief and analysis is also required in the MFOQA Program.  Such capability will assist organizational-level maintenance crews in both event-driven and reliability centered maintenance tasks.  This workstation will also be enabled by a server-based system at multiple DON shore and ship-based organizations.  

Flight Data Analysis (FDA):  A multiple server and archival database system capable of handling large amounts of flight data will be required.  After data translation from the appropriate aircraft system, the analysis process will be capable of both single and aggregate flight analysis and trending, accessible at multiple organizational levels.   

Mishap Investigation:  MFOQA will also provide a valuable service in mishap investigation, by conducting replay and analysis of data that is recovered post-mishap from non-crash survivable recorders.   It is anticipated that this requirement will be fulfilled by the same COTS product that is developed to support the post-mission debrief and FDA described above.

ManTech Systems Engineering Corporation located in Lexington Park, MD was competitively awarded task order M801 under the Seaport contract (N00178-04-D-4080) to integrate the FOQA Open Architecture COTS product into the Naval Aviation Enterprise Architecture, to accomplish full MFOQA capability.  This ManTech development effort entails designing the overarching MFOQA architecture throughout the NAE, integrating the FOQA COTS software into the overall MFOQA system, and providing all training and overall long term updates and administration functions for the DON MFOQA system.

DON intends to procure COTS FOQA software, non-recurring engineering services to support the ManTech MFOQA development effort and recurring product support that will best meet the framework of MFOQA.  While it is understood that most current FOQA software products will require adaptation and support for conversion to MFOQA, DON desires to enter an enterprise agreement that allows maximum flexibility with regard to number of servers, clients, and data base configuration.  It is also highly desirable that any COTS product procured by DON be fully open to configuration changes by internal DON organizations such as addition of new aircraft types and other visualization objects, report and event set changes, as well as major modification of the web-based analysis tools to meet future needs of DON

The contract period of performance shall include a base year plus four (4) options.  The required delivery of the initial FOQA software is within six weeks of contract award.     

It is anticipated that a DRAFT RFP for N00019-07-R-0060 will be released during the week of 6 August 2007. Upon release, interested parties will be able to view/download the documents  which will be posted on the NAVAIR web-site http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations.     

In addition to making the solicitation available for downloading via the Internet site, this office will also attempt to E-mail a notification of release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments to all prospective offerors that submit a request to register for this information via E-mail. E-mail requests should be sent to the following address: Melanie.Bateman@navy.mil and should include the following information for the purpose of compiling a Bidders Mailing List: 1. Company Name 2. Company Address 3. Point-of-contact, telephone number, fax number and E-mail address. In the interest of acquisition streamlining, prospective offerors are strongly encouraged to use the Internet for the purpose of submitting requests relative to this solicitation. Telephone requests for the solicitation will neither be accepted nor returned. A paper copy of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments will not be available or issued. 

NOTE:     Contractors must be registered in the Central Contract Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DOD activity.   

All Discussions, Comments, Or Questions relative to the the MFOQA Solicitation must be addressed directly to the Contracts office.  They may be addressed to Ms. Maureen Bernard, PCO, at (301) 757-5899 or maureen.bernard@navy.mil and/or  Ms. Melanie Bateman, Contract Specialist, at (301) 757-6572 or  melanie.bateman@navy.mil

<SUBJECT>D -- A-COMPUTER ASSISTED MARITIME THREAT EVALUATION SYSTEM
<SOLNBR>N00189-07-R-0032
<CONTACT>Aninze Awanna, Contract Specialist, Phone 757-443-1328, Fax 757-443-1337, Email aninze.awanna@navy.mil
<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed prices type contract with Time and Material provisions for services (including labor) for the development of a threat evaluation software system to improve maritime domain awareness in a selected Area of Responsibility (AOR) as required by the Commander Navy Europe/Commander Sixth Fleet, Naples, Italy.  This is a 100% Small Business set aside under North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) 541511.

The means of achieving this goal under contract will be to apply a COMPUTER ASSISTED MARITIME THREAT EVALUATION SYSTEM software program, fully compatible and interfaced with maritime detection data inputted from deployed equipment, tools, instruments, or other data sources, and authorized to operate in a military or a coalition network environment (classified or non-classified). The contractor shall provide a computer based threat evaluation system together with any other complementary, associated, supporting or bundled programs that will analyze ocean going cargo vessels for security implications in support of comprehensive maritime domain awareness efforts. The system shall allow for utilization of business rules developed in collaboration with coalition/Alliance partners, be approved by the US Navy and access external data to allow accurate, in depth and reliable threat evaluation and analysis, realistic and practical recommendations for interdiction, boarding or other appropriate action. Features shall include: Automatic data stream to identify and geolocate vessels; allow specification of parameters controlling which vessels to evaluate i.e. (geographic bounds, flag state, vessel type or size etc.); allow for access to external data to discover vessel, crew, cargo and voyage data; allow user developed threat evaluation rules and scoring to be applied to data automatically; shall display an operational picture with indications of threat status for all vessels based on a logical combination of scores derived from the application of each threat evaluation rule; and allow drill-down to display logic behind the threat status for each vessel. EXAMINATION OF SOURCE SELECTION PLAN Offerors are invited to examine the Navy Source Selection Plan (SSP), located at http://www.fedbizops.gov on or before 17 August 2007. It is not unusual for an SSP to contain some matters not specifically described in the solicitation, and vice versa.  For instance, the SSP will often identify the evaluation weighting scheme in greater detail, and may include the forms used by the Technical Evaluation Board in reviewing proposals. Despite these variations, both documents are intended to operate in harmony.  If any Offeror discovers an actual conflict between the provisions of the SSP and the Solicitation, this matter must be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer before the proposal submission date.  Please keep in mind that a conflict involves provisions that are inconsistent or mutually exclusive, not merely containing more detailed or additional information.  In the event that the SSP and the solicitation are in direct conflict, the provisions of the solicitation will apply, except for those matters referenced in the SSP that may be mandated by law or regulation.  

N.B.: If the Offeror cannot access the SSP from the address provided above, immediately contact the Contracting Officer or the Governments designated representative identified in. The proposed request for proposals (RFP) N00189-07-R-0032 will be posted on or before 17 August 2007 with a response date of 30 days thereafter. Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  This office no longer issues hardcopy solicitations.  

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price with the offerors at anytime prior to award.  By submitting a proposal, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.   Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that the prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside of the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make the offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   RFQ-OH-07-00149, for the Technical Support Services for Calculating Metrics that Characterize the Sustainability of the San Luis Basin, Colorado will be issued on Thursday August 02, 2007.  If a contractor is interested in receiving the RFQ for this EPA requirement they must submit a request via email for RFQ-OH-07-00149 to Scott Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov.  A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  The performance period will be 13 months from the date of award of the firm fixed price purchase order. The EPA  estimates 420 labor hours will be needed to complete this requirement.  This requirement is a being procured on a full and open competition basis.  The NAICS code is 541990.  The synopsis for this EPA requirement is as follows: Over 50% of the land base in EPA Region 8 is publicly owned; much of  it by the federal government, and many of the environmental management responsibilities of EPA Region 8 involve public lands.  Over the long-term, the maintenance of intact and sustainable regional ecosystems depends on the ability of all land-owning neighbors to manage and utilize their land in a  sustainable manner. Under the guidance of two Executive Orders, the EPA has been tasked by Congress to provide direction and assistance to Federal agencies to help them comply. These orders are: Executive Order 13150:  "Federal Workforce Transportation" Executive Order 13423:  "Strengthening  Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management" The implementation of these Executive Orders requires an understanding of the effects of built environments, human activities, and management decisions on the landscape.  Successful implementation of these orders is essential to the  work of the Regions, and this establishes a need for scientifically sound sustainability metrics that will assist scientists and engineers in making these decisions. The EPA has started collecting data from the SLB region.  The purpose of the work covered by RFQ-OH-07-00149 is to obtain Contractor  services to fully understand the SLB Region, by filling in the data gaps, validating and verifying the data and calculations of the metrics, and review research products. The performance period will be 13 months from the date of award of the firm fixed price purchase order. Quotations are due  August 17, 2007 at 4:00 PM (EDT) to Scott A. Fogle, at fogle.scott@epa.gov or via fax at 513 487-2107.  Technical Questions or comments may also be directed to Scott A. Fogle, at 513 487-2049, or at fogle.scott@epa.gov NLT 12:00 PM (EDT) August 09, 2007.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in equal order of importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Innovativeness of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require up to a TS/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access up to TS/SCI information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror?s will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical points of contact, as specified below:

<CONTACT>James McLaughlin, Contract Specialist, Phone 719-556-3849, Fax 719-556-7396, Email james.mclaughlin@peterson.af.mil
<DESC>Air Force Space Command has started the preliminary planning process (P3) required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 and the 1 Jan 05 USAF Commercial Activities A-76 Preliminary Planning Guidebook for space control operations, Air Force Space Surveillance Sensor (AFSSS) data computation, and mission systems support at 20th Space Control Squadron, Detachment 1 (20 SPCS, Det 1), Dahlgren VA.  As part of P3, the team conducts preliminary market research to determine the existence of viable commercial source(s) capable of providing the necessary services and to determine the appropriate groupings of activities as business units.  (Extensive market research necessary to support acquisition strategy decisions will be conducted if/after a streamlined or standard competition is announced in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.)  

The scope of the required services is threefold:  space control operations, AFSSS data computation, and mission systems support for 20 SPCS, Det 1 within Government facilities at Dahlgren, VA.  First, space control operations services support the 20 SPCS, Det 1 mission as the Alternate Space Control Center (ASCC)—the alternate processing center, command, control, and communications interface for the Joint Space Control Center located in Cheyenne Mountain Air Station.  Space control operations include detecting, tracking, identifying, cataloging, and maintaining accurate identification of all man-made objects in space; providing collision avoidance for the International Space Station and space shuttle; and providing space-related operational intelligence using government-furnished mission systems and all in accordance with STRATCOM Directive (SD) 505-1, Volumes I and II.  The assets in the space surveillance network (SSN) are the source for all of the raw data facilitating space control operations.  Specialized knowledge and developed analytical skills are necessary to perform space control operations to include an understanding of the SSN; an understanding of orbital mechanics; an understanding of the functionality and by-products of optical sensors, phased-array radars, and space-based radars; and an understanding of launch vehicles, payloads, and launch facilities.  Second, services include data computation for the six AFSSS receiver sites.  Both the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services involve processing, manipulating, interpreting, and analyzing all space events (domestic and foreign) such as launches, maneuvers, deorbits, separations, conjunction analysis, reentry assessments, break-ups, and decays.  Specialized knowledge and developed analytical skills are necessary to perform AFSSS data computation to include an understanding of orbital mechanics; an understanding of the fixed-radar functionality; and an understanding of launch vehicles, payloads, and launch facilities.  Third, mission systems support includes operating, administering, monitoring, and maintaining (organizational/user-lever maintenance only) the Mission Processing System (MPS) at Dahlgren, VA.  The MPS consists of multiple networked processors and associated mission system equipment using a UNIX-based operating system.  The network consists of CISCO routers and hubs.  The system is designed with redundant processing capability and back-up systems to ensure operational availability.  The core of the MPS is two multi-node IBM towers that perform the majority of the computational processing.  Other key MPS components include a high-availability cluster of three IBM servers that provide database and file systems services.  There are also approximately 90 workstations for application processing by the operational users.  The MPS software consists of over two hundred applications including communications and data processing applications that operate continually for real-time processing.  The service includes monitoring the real-time execution of these applications.

All services are required twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  Service provider employees must be U.S. citizens with either a secret or top-secret/sensitive-compartmented information security clearance.  

This sources sought synopsis is published under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541513 with an associated Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of $21 million.  The 541513 NAICS code best describes the mission system support and a portion of the space control operations and AFSSS data computation.  Another sources sought synopsis is also published under the NAICS code 541690 with an associated size standard of $6 million.  The 541690 NAICS code best describes a good portion of the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services.  If as a result of the P3 report a standard competition is announced and the services are solicited as a whole, a single NAICS code will be selected that best describes the overall acquisition based on value.  

Request companies that are interested in performing the services described above provide an electronic capabilities package to the contracting officer not later than 23 Sep 05.  In addition to describing capability to provide the service, ensure the package addresses the following:  (1) Provide a summary and customer points of contact on past contracts for similar services.  (2) Discuss the appropriate groupings of business activities.  For example, is it logical to group the space control operations, AFSSS data computation, and mission system support together in one effort/contract or should they be split as separate requirements and why?  (3)  Which, if any, parts of the effort would you likely subcontract rather than using in-house resources and why?  (4) Discuss your ability and sources to obtain and retain qualified personnel.  (5) Address recommendations regarding selection of NAICS code.  (6) Address business size status (to include specific identification as an 8a, HUBZone, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based on proposed and your recommended NAICS codes.  (7) Provide a point of contact for follow-up questions.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management on behalf of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for one base year plus four (4) option years with the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) to provide dental homes for Head Start and early Head Start Children.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), only one responsible source and  no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   The Office of Head Start has determined there is a need to establish a national network of dentists that will serve as quality dental homes for Head Start and Early Head Start Children.  Limited access to oral health services continues to be identified by the Office of Head Start (OHS), ACF Regional Office, Head Start, grantee and delegate agencies as the top health issue impacting Head Start children and families.  The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry is uniquely qualified to fulfill the tasks of this contract, and we do not believe that there are other potential organizations that possess the skills and resources to perform the tasks that are required for the following reasons: AAPD is the membership organization in the United States representing the specialty of pediatric dentistry, the only recognized dental specialty that focuses exclusively on children.  The AAPD represents the oral health interests of children.  The pediatric dentist is a recognized primary oral health care provider and resource for specialty referral for young children needing specialized oral health services.  The AAPD i advocates policies, guidelines and programs that promote optimal oral health and oral health care for children. The AAPD serves and represents its membership in the areas of professional development and governmental and legislative activities. It is a liaison to other health care groups and the public.   AAPD also offers an affiliate membership category for other types of dentists and non dental health care providers interested in oral health care for children, and works closely with other health professional and child advocacy organizations. This contract will establish a National and Regional Oral Health Consultant Pool and Oral Health Expertise to the OHS to develop a national network of pediatric and general dentists comprised of pediatric dentists, general dentists with Head Start experience, or dental hygienists with Head Start experience that will provide dental homes for Head Start and Early Head Start children and families.  Additionally, establish a national and regional oral health consultant pool that will provide on-site technical assistance to Head Start grantees and the ACF Regional Offices to: 1)develop a strategy for recruiting and training dentists, and provide on-site oral health expertise, including policy analysis and development, to the Office of Head Start, 2) develop and Implement a Head Start Dental Training Program to train dentists about the oral health requirements of the Head Start program and on working with young children from low-income, culturally diverse families, and 3) develop Oral Health Policy Analysis and Development issues impacting Head Start and Early Head Start children and families. Vendors who are interested in this acquisition should submit a statement of capabilities including detailed documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement.  The statement of capabilities must specifically demonstrate the following: 1. Ability to provide oral health consultant pool comprised of pediatric dentists, general dentists with Head Start experience, or dental hygienists with Head Start experience, that will provide technical expertise to Head Start grantees; 2. Ability to establish a national network of dentists that will serve as quality dental homes for Head Start children; 3. Ability to provide staff that has proven successful academic and professional work experience in the filed of pediatric dentists, general dentists and dental hygienists; and 4. Ability to Develop and Implement a Head Start Dental Training Program suitable for language translation; proven experience in providing and coordinating training and technical expertise to Head Start grantees and the ACF Regional Offices. Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. Responses must be submitted within 45 days from the date of publication of this notice. No solicitation is available. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The contractor will provide vegetation control services to the Trident and Poseidon Berms within the boundaries of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.  Herbicides will be applied to grassland/shrubland areas of 142.7 and 50 acres respectively, to control invasive vegetation including Brazilian Pepper, Cogon Grass and to a lesser extent other woody species encroaching on the interior and on the exterior of these dredge spoil deposition berms.

Since the area on the interior of the berm is very inaccessible to vehicular application methods, aerial application is preferred and it will incorporate GPS assisted swath placement.  The application equipment will provide GPS guidance information to be extracted into GIS and analyzed.  The contractor will need to develop a Flight Plan and obtain approval from Base Operations and Air Traffic Control.  Any equipment, whether aerial or ground, will be transported in accordance with Florida DOT regulations.  Areas on the outside of the berm, including the exterior face and the base, will be treated with hand held equipment or vehicle mounted units.  GPS data will be generated for these areas as well.  The contractor will support this SOW by providing a post-herbicide application assessment up to two times per year and continuing for up to two years following application to ensure that the treatment is efficacious and meets the goals and objectives set forth.

The requirement is for the creation of 2007 seagrass and mangrove GIS maps that depict trends in habitat coverage over a 2001-2007 time series for the Lake Worth Lagoon within Palm Beach County, Florida.  This project is part of a larger, on-going effort partially funded by the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) in coordination with the Palm Beach County Department of Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to map seagrass and mangrove habitat.  Specifically, this project will provide funds for the creation of trends analysis GIS maps.  The data layers produced as part of this project will be used by ERM and NOAA Fisheries and other state, federal, and local agencies to affect scientifically-sound management and monitoring of the resources within the Lake Worth Lagoon.  This project is being initiated as a component of NOAA Fisheries Service efforts on behalf of the Coral Reef Task Force established by President Clinton in June 1998 through Executive Order #13089.  The Executive Order, identified as Coral Reef Protection, seeks to ?preserve and protect the biodiversity, health, heritage, and social and economic value of U.S. coral reef ecosystems and marine environment.? 
	The GIS data layers that will be created as part of this project will be the intellectual property of the Palm Beach County ERM.  The GIS data layers of seagrass and mangrove coverage that will be used to create the trends maps are the property of ERM and contain proprietary information.  ERM has the technical capability, staff, administrative resources, equipment, and additional funding, such as from donors like the Lake Worth Lagoon Grant Partnership Program, to complete this project.  Further, ERM has the knowledge and experience with environmental resource issues in Palm Beach County that is necessary to ensure the project is successfully executed. Finally, Palm Beach County is contributing $80,000 in in-kind services in the form of software, work station computers, a boat for field verification of GIS maps, and staff time.

<DESC>Air Force Space Command has started the preliminary planning process (P3) required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 and the 1 Jan 05 USAF Commercial Activities A-76 Preliminary Planning Guidebook for space control operations, Air Force Space Surveillance Sensor (AFSSS) data computation, and mission systems support at 20th Space Control Squadron, Detachment 1 (20 SPCS, Det 1), Dahlgren VA.  As part of P3, the team conducts preliminary market research to determine the existence of viable commercial source(s) capable of providing the necessary services and to determine the appropriate groupings of activities as business units.  (Extensive market research necessary to support acquisition strategy decisions will be conducted if/after a streamlined or standard competition is announced in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.)  

The scope of the required services is threefold:  space control operations, AFSSS data computation, and mission systems support for 20 SPCS, Det 1 within Government facilities at Dahlgren, VA.  First, space control operations services support the 20 SPCS, Det 1 mission as the Alternate Space Control Center (ASCC)—the alternate processing center, command, control, and communications interface for the Joint Space Control Center located in Cheyenne Mountain Air Station.  Space control operations include detecting, tracking, identifying, cataloging, and maintaining accurate identification of all man-made objects in space; providing collision avoidance for the International Space Station and space shuttle; and providing space-related operational intelligence using government-furnished mission systems and all in accordance with STRATCOM Directive (SD) 505-1, Volumes I and II.  The assets in the space surveillance network (SSN) are the source for all of the raw data facilitating space control operations.  Specialized knowledge and developed analytical skills are necessary to perform space control operations to include an understanding of the SSN; an understanding of orbital mechanics; an understanding of the functionality and by-products of optical sensors, phased-array radars, and space-based radars; and an understanding of launch vehicles, payloads, and launch facilities.  Second, services include data computation for the six AFSSS receiver sites.  Both the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services involve processing, manipulating, interpreting, and analyzing all space events (domestic and foreign) such as launches, maneuvers, deorbits, separations, conjunction analysis, reentry assessments, break-ups, and decays.  Specialized knowledge and developed analytical skills are necessary to perform AFSSS data computation to include an understanding of orbital mechanics; an understanding of the fixed-radar functionality; and an understanding of launch vehicles, payloads, and launch facilities.  Third, mission systems support includes operating, administering, monitoring, and maintaining (organizational/user-lever maintenance only) the Mission Processing System (MPS) at Dahlgren, VA.  The MPS consists of multiple networked processors and associated mission system equipment using a UNIX-based operating system.  The network consists of CISCO routers and hubs.  The system is designed with redundant processing capability and back-up systems to ensure operational availability.  The core of the MPS is two multi-node IBM towers that perform the majority of the computational processing.  Other key MPS components include a high-availability cluster of three IBM servers that provide database and file systems services.  There are also approximately 90 workstations for application processing by the operational users.  The MPS software consists of over two hundred applications including communications and data processing applications that operate continually for real-time processing.  The service includes monitoring the real-time execution of these applications.

All services are required twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  Service provider employees must be U.S. citizens with either a secret or top-secret/sensitive-compartmented information security clearance.  

This sources sought synopsis is published under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541513 with an associated Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of $21 million.  The 541513 NAICS code best describes the mission system support and a portion of the space control operations and AFSSS data computation.  Another sources sought synopsis is also published under the NAICS code 541690 with an associated size standard of $6 million.  The 541690 NAICS code best describes a good portion of the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services.  If as a result of the P3 report a standard competition is announced and the services are solicited as a whole, a single NAICS code will be selected that best describes the overall acquisition based on value.  

Request companies that are interested in performing the services described above provide an electronic capabilities package to the contracting officer not later than 23 Sep 05.  In addition to describing capability to provide the service, ensure the package addresses the following:  (1) Provide a summary and customer points of contact on past contracts for similar services.  (2) Discuss the appropriate groupings of business activities.  For example, is it logical to group the space control operations, AFSSS data computation, and mission system support together in one effort/contract or should they be split as separate requirements and why?  (3)  Which, if any, parts of the effort would you likely subcontract rather than using in-house resources and why?  (4) Discuss your ability and sources to obtain and retain qualified personnel.  (5) Address recommendations regarding selection of NAICS code.  (6) Address business size status (to include specific identification as an 8a, HUBZone, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based on proposed and your recommended NAICS codes.  (7) Provide a point of contact for follow-up questions.

<DESC>The US Forest Service is interested in finding potential sources to provide Type 1 infrared services used to detect and map wildland fires. The government intends to set up multiple basic ordering/purchase agreements (BOA/BPA) with qualified vendors to provide these services on an as needed basis. Type 1 infrared systems are utilized to detect small heat sources distributed over large geographic areas and to map large wildland fires. Type 1 systems are capable of imaging large wildland fire incidents quickly to provide data for the Situation Unit Leader (SITL).  The information is used to help in the development of the Incident Action Plan (IAP).  Type 1 infrared systems are mounted on twin-engine or jet aircraft and can cover large geographic areas quickly. The government would require the contractor to be on call and provide the aircraft, pilot, Type 1 sensor system, associated support equipment and sensor operator. The contractor will be responsible for providing the sensor output (data) in a format that is compatible with the Forest Service and Department of Interior Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The government base of operations for these services will be the National Interagency Fire Center located in Boise, ID.

If you have any interest in providing these services to the government please contact Matt Olson, Contracting Specialist, by 26 June 2007 in order to discuss the possibility of setting up a BPA with your company.

<SUBJECT>R--Enterprise Risk Assessment Methodology (ERAM) and Business Life Cycle (BCL) Risk Management Support for the Business Transformation Agency (BTA)
<SOLNBR>W91QUZ
<RESPDATE>081007
<ARCHDATE>10092007
<CONTACT>stephanie benger, 703-325-5457
<DESC>Background/Overview of Requirement: Over the course of the last year, The Business Transformation Agency (BTA) has been conducting risk assessments on selected Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS) in the Business Mission Area. The purpose of these assessments have been to help speed th e fielding of business capabilities through the early identification of risk and to develop mitigation strategies to address this risk. Depending upon policy decisions, there is a high likelihood that in October 2007, these assessments will become an integ ral part of a new governance construct for oversight, investment and acquisition of MAIS level business systems in the DoD.  These assessments are conducted by 8-13 member teams utilizing the Enterprise Risk Assessment Methodology (ERAM) developed by BTA. An assessment, which lasts 6-8 weeks, and resembles a commercial consulting engagement in intensity and execution, normally c onsists of three main elements: (a) 2-3 weeks of detailed review of program documents; (b) 2-3 days of on site face-to-face interviews (up to 100 interviews) with all key program personnel, key stakeholders, and a broad and deep cross section of all other program personnel or user community; and (c) 2-3 weeks of the creation and socialization of a detailed deliverable with clear concise statements of risk, mitigation actions and follow-up activities, as needed. At the conclusion of the assessment, an on-goi ng relationship is established, as needed, to assist in the mitigation of risk, resolution of issues, removal of barriers, etc. It is anticipated that at least 9-12 ERAMs will be conducted over the course of the next year. An ERAM assessment identifies risk in seven different risk areas. These are: * Strategy (e.g. time line, business process re-engineering, implementation approach, data conversion, etc) * People (e.g. leadership, experience of Govt. personnel, experience of integrator personnel, etc) * Technology (e.g. architecture, scalability, performance, platforms, tools, etc) * Contract (e.g. software license, use of appropriate contract type, well defined requirements in contract, service level agreements, etc) * Process (e.g. plans, change management, testing approach, charters, issue management, risk management, etc) * Scope/Requirements (e.g. requirements traceability, scope management, clarity of requirements, etc) * External (e.g. OSD mandates, policy changes, BTA, congress) The ERAM Final Deliverable is developed in collaboration with the Program Office and consists of: (a) detailed Risk Descriptions; (b) Risk Mitigation Recommendations; and (c) a Risk Mitigation Action Plan. This deliverable will be briefed to the Investment  Review Boards (IRB), Defense Business Systems Management Committee (DBSMC), Components and Program Managers.   As a result of anticipated policy changes in October 2007, the demand on the ERAM teams is expected to grow and BTA is investigating the potential for supporting the core ERAM teams with 2-4 contractor support personnel who would:  * Work with the programs being assessed to collect all documentation to be reviewed by the ERAM teams. * Conduct thorough and detailed reviews of the documentation provided by the program in order to understand the risk profile of the program. * Develop risk hypotheses and candidate questions to be used in interviews of program personnel after reviewing the documentation in order to validate or invalidate these risk hypotheses. * Prepare Government staff to lead interviews of program personnel. * Assist matrixed Government personnel in conducting interviews of program leadership * Capture detailed notes during the interview process. * Conduct analysis and synthesis of the captured notes in a workshop setting to create a comprehensive assessment of the risks facing the program. * Assist in the creation of potential risk mitigation strategies for identified program risks. * Prepare draft documentation of ris k findings for the programs to use as part of their risk mitigations efforts. * Assist the Government lead in briefing the risk findings to the program leadership and stakeholder community. * Work with the assessed programs to finalize and execute a risk mitigation strategy to address identified risks. * Engage with assessed programs on an ongoing basis to advise and monitor their risk mitigation efforts. * Advising the Government on commercial best practices in the implementation of commercial off the shelf (COTS) products, ERPs and other software systems. * Assist the functional community in defining business cases where that help is requested of the BTA. * Assist the Government in further development and refinement of ERAM as part of the due diligence mechanism of the Business Capability Lifecycle (BCL). * Support the Government in education efforts to ensure that BCL and ERAM is well understood across the DoD. * Assist and supporting formal education efforts related to BCL and ERAM through DoD acquisition schoolhouses such as DAU and NDU. In order to provide meaningful assistance to the ERAM teams, contractor personnel would have to be highly skilled and well experienced.  Personnel should be able to quickly identify areas of risk to a program and able to provide credible guidance to progra ms on how best to mitigate identified risks such as cost and schedule overrun, scope creep, business process re-engineering or failure of a program to deliver promised capabilities. They should have a very strong understanding of best practices in commerci al off-the-shelf business software application program management and commercial off-the-shelf business software application risk management as defined by commercial and Government best practices.  It is anticipated therefore that to effectively support the ERAM team, personnel at a minimum would have:  * Full life-cycle program management experience in oversight and/or direct program management roles (10 year minimum). * Broad experience in multiple roles both in direct program management, direct execution roles or in risk assessment roles for commercial off-the-shelf business applications. * Experience in Microsoft Office applications including Word, Excel and PowerPoint. * Bachelors degree in business, management or a technical discipline (engineering, computer science or similar), Masters preferred. * Extensive prior experience in the external assessment of risk to multiple programs (3 years experience and  review of a minimum of 7 programs).  * Broad experience with both Government and commercial IT programs including ERP implementation, custom software development and other COTS package implementations. Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI):  Conducting ERAM assessments poses a significant risk of Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCIs), as discussed in FAR Subpart 9.5.  In particular, a contractors judgment and objectivity in performing the contract requirements may be impaired if the sub stance of its performance has the potential to affect other activities and interests of the contractor.  For example, a contractors judgment and objectivity may be impaired if it provides evaluations, advice, recommendations, guidance, or oversight in con nection with MAIS level business systems to include enterprise business system development efforts, implementation efforts, or related activities, in which it participated or is currently participating.  The below programs are currently anticipated to be assessed under this effort; however, the list is subject to change.   * Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIHMRS) * General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) * Integrated Data Environment initiative and Global Transportation Network Convergence (IGE/GTN) * Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) * Global Combat Support System - Army (GCSS-A) * Global Combat Support System  Marine Corps (GCSS-MC) * Logisti cs Modernization Program (LMP) * Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) * Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) Another example of  risk for impaired objectivity is the contractor providing evaluations, advice, recommendations, or guidance regarding its competitors, as discussed in FAR 9.505-3.   Through this effort, the contractor may gain access to non-public information that creates an unfair competitive advantage in connection with future competitive procurements. Neither the award of a contract, nor the Governments tasking for contractor serv ices thereunder, shall constitute or be interpreted as a determination that the contractor is eligible to participate in future procurements for MAIS level business system development efforts, implementation efforts, or related activities. In fact, perform ance under this anticipated contract may render the contractor ineligible for future awards.  Only Contracting Officers for such efforts, applying the rules, principles and procedures of FAR Subpart 9.5 have the authority to determine whether an OCI exists  in connection with such procurements.  To mitigate the risks of potential OCIs, the following types of safeguards are envisioned to be used by the contractor for any potential contracts that result for ERAM: * The contractor shall not provide any services under this contract that relate to MAIS level business systems in which the contractor is participating as a prime contractor, team member, consultant or subcontractor at any tier.  * The contractor will be required to propose an OCI Mitigation Plan, in response to an RFP, to be incorporated into any resulting contract. It is conceivable, however, even with the OCI Mitigation Plan, that some contractors will have OCIs that cannot be mitigated.  Those contractors will be ineligible for award. Points of Contact (POCs): BTA is seeking information on whether companies are interested in and are capable of providing 2-4 personnel with the types of skills, qualifications and experience needed to provide meaningful contract support to the ERAM teams described above, in light o f the technical requirements as well as the OCI  restrictions.  Please submit your capabilities to Kathie Jones at Kathleen.jones@conus.army.mil or Stephanie.benger1@conus.army.mil by August 10.  Contractors interested in obtaining additional information t hrough an Industry Day event should annotate that in their capabilities submission. Please note: The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information solicited.  This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contra ct.  Do not provide any costing data with your submission.  This RFI shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the government to acquire any products or services.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect c osts or charges by the government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the governments use of such information.

<SUBJECT>70 -- KenCast Maintenance Support
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  

The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) requires the continued maintenance support of the FAZZT Digital Delivery System Software Suite.  The maintenance support includes software upgrades, 24/7 telephone and technical assistance for the FAZZT Enterprise Server, FAZZT Power Publisher and the FAZZT Enterprise Client.  KenCast is the exclusive provider of the FAZZT Digital Delivery System Software Suite.  No other vendor is authorized to distribute these services.  Interested parties may e-mail joyce.wright@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, Joyce Wright, not later than Tuesday, 21 August 2007, 9:00 a.m. EST.

Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:    

22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by Tuesday, 21 August 2007, 9:00 a.m. EST will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

V.  	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)

The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) requires the continued maintenance support of the FAZZT Digital Delivery System Software Suite.  KenCast is the exclusive provider of the FAZZT Digital Delivery System Software Suite.  No other vendor is authorized to distribute these services.  The FAZZT Digital Delivery System Software Suite is integrated into and supports the JCSE Global Broadcast System (GBS) Theater Insertion Point (TIP) equipment.  The GBS TIP was implemented by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) Operational Support Office (OSO) and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and is responsible for the accurate and secure transmission of intelligence, weather, and other information through computers, handheld devices, live streams, wireless devices, and satellites.  Failure to maintain the FAZZT software will result in mission failure of the JCSE GBS TIP.  The only other option would be to purchase another software suite.  To purchase another software suite would entail approvals, absorbing $3M in the current equipment investments, absorbing the costs of the new equipment investments, time to employ new equipment, and training of personnel.  Employing another software suite is neither rational nor reasonable when it too would require upgrades and continued maintenance support.   

NOTE:  52.232-18 -- Availability of Funds is in effect for this requirement. 

52.232-18 -- Availability of Funds (Apr 1984)

Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Air Sampling Cylinders
<DESC>NOAA?s Acquisition & Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Essex Cryogenics of Missouri for 12 each Department of Transportation (DOT) approved stainless steel gas cylinders for the storage of trace gases related to research on climate change and atmospheric chemistry.  

The sole source determination is based on the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) Global Monitoring Division?s requirement for cylinders in their research on the global distribution and trends of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric trace species.  The cylinder requirements are as follows:  1) Internal Volume:  25-40 liters; 2) Material: 304 stainless-steel; 3) Service Pressure: 900 psia (or greater); 4) DOT Certification: for a period of at least 5 years; 5) Valve: DOT-approved, stainless steel valve with metal seat and stem; 6) Internal Surface: chemically inert (electro-polished or Summa treated to near-mirror finish); and 7) Cleaning: halogen-free cleaning (no chlorinated solvents).  The interior finish of the cylinder is most critical to NOAA?s research.  DOT approval means that a cylinder can be transported containing approximately 20 times more air than one that is not DOT-approved.  Essex Cryogenics is the only company that manufactures a stainless steel sampling cylinder approved and certified by the Department of Transportation (DOT).  These cylinders were developed by Essex through the cooperative efforts between Essex engineers and scientists from NOAA and the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide cylinders that fully meet the Government?s requirements as indicated above may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Documentation shall include evidence that their product can meet requirements 1-7 stated above and the DOT number that identifies the category and the service pressure.  For example, the Essex Cryogenics cylinders are certified as DOT # 4DS900.   Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<SUBJECT>--Request For Information (RFI): Commercial Sensors Requirement for the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) BEING RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) PART 10 MARKET RESEARCH.  This RFI is issued solely for informational, market research, and planning purposes only. It does not con stitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or  administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. At this time, proprietary information is not being requested, and respondents shall refrain from provi ding proprietary information in response to this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any f urther RFP, if any is issued. In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor these sites for  additional information pertaining to this RFI. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. The United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) is conducting a Market Survey to acquire commercial sensors that are currently available as a commercial item.  The sensors that are currently being utilized are the FLIR System Model AN/AA Q-22 StarSAFIRE III Airborne Thermal Imaging System.  The supplier must provide a minimum of 325 sensors between 1 Oct 2007 and 30 Sep 2008. The  requirement is for an optical sensor with 360 degree field of coverage capable of detecting and providing geo location data on man size targets (2 meters by 1 meter) out to a range in excess of 10 kilometers.  Visible and infrared capabilities are req uired for day and night time use.  Visible sensor shall include full color and spotter scope capability for zooming in on distant targets of interest and obtaining maximum discriminatory information on those targets.  Visible and infra red sensors shall be  bore sighted together such that switching from one sensor to the other will result in looking at the same location. A laser range finder (or equivalent geo location device) will also be bore sighted to the visible and infrared sensor look angles for accur ate computation of the location of the object being viewed.  Sensor housing shall be actively stabilized to insure that distant targets, regardless of their relative motion with respect to the sensor, can be viewed for extended periods of time without resu lting in excessive strain on the operator viewing the image.  Visible and infra red sensors shall have multiple fields of view to allow for wide angle panning of the area followed by an instantaneous switching to a narrow or super narrow field of regard fo r rapidly assessing distant targets of interest.  Sensor shall also have a laser pointer and auto tracking capability.  Laser pointer shall provide a beam of light visible only through night vision goggles.  That beam of light will originate at the sensor and be bore sighted such that it will terminate at the target of interest as soon as it is activated (i.e. no searching for the target will be required). The control and display functions of this sensor suite (i.e. visible sensor, IR sensor, spotter scope, laser pointer, etc.) shall be well documented in an interface control document.  This interface control document shall be used to assess the level of sof tware modifications that will be required to interface these control and display functions with existing map overlay software.  Hardware mounting documentation shall also be provided for a determination of the lev el of effort that will be required to mount the selected sensor to existing platforms (towers, masts, etc.).  The level of software and hardware rework required will have a bearing on the sensor selected. The sensor suite shall have a minimum mean time between failure (MTBF) of 2,000 hours under harsh environments and 24/7 usage. Back up data to justify the advertised sensor suite MTBF may be requested.  The sensor vendor shall also be required to demonstra te a rapid mean time to repair capability.  Adequately trained technical repair staff along with repair facilities and sufficient on-hand spare parts shall be required to handle the expected number of sensor repairs over a given period of time.   DESIRED INFORMATION:   Documentation may be submitted at any time after issuance of this RFI up to the expiration date of the RFI.  1) The vendor should submit capability documentation of its ability to fulfill the requirement.  The vendor should summarize  their skills and experience in supporting similar requirements. This summary should also include any teaming or subcontracting arrangements in which the vendor participated in providing services for a requirement of this magnitude. 2) The vendor should pr ovide a customer point of contact (name, address, telephone number) for each experience described and indicate whether the vendor performed as a prime or subcontractor. 3) Vendors should identify any contract vehicles (GSA/FSS, GWACs, etc) that are current ly available that can support the requirements contained herein.  4) Certification that this is a Commercial off the shelf product. This may be in the form of catalog listing for the item. Documentation showing which (if any) of the desired features are in cluded.  This may be in the form of technical or operating manuals/documentation. SUBMISSION:  All responses should be submitted by email.  Telephone requests will not be honored. No additional data will be provided in support of this RFI.  All information in responses should be unclassified.  Responses should include the vendors busin ess size status based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334220.  The response format should be MS Word documents (12 point font) or PDF files readable by Adobe Acrobat  sent via email.    Email submissions/inquiries should b e directed to Patricia J. Vail, Contract Specialist, at Patricia.Vail@smdc.army.mil.  Vendor information must be received by 12 August 2007.  Responses received after this date will not be considered.

<CONTACT>Debra J. Peterson, (612) 713-5188 Contract Specialist 6127135188 Debra_Peterson@fws.gov;
<DESC>(i)   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. (ii)   Solicitation Number 301817Q329 is being issued in a Request For Quotations (RFQ) format.  (iii)   This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-18.  (iv)   This is a 100% Small Business Set Aside (SBSA) under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2 only on condition that at least one responsible small business submits a responsive quote with a grand total price of less than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 212319, with a corresponding small business size standard of 500 employees.  All bidders must disclose their appropriate size standard in the submitted quotation(s) in order for the quotation to be considered responsive to this solicitation.  (v)   Line Item 0001:  Supply and Delivery of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Approved RR3 Riprap.  Quantity is 6,400 Tons.  Quotes are to indicate the unit price and extended amount.   (vi)  The riprap to be delivered shall be durable and of a suitable quality to ensure performance in structure and in the climate in which it is to be used.  It shall be free from cracks, seams, and other defects that would tend to increase unduly its deterioration from natural causes.  The inclusion of objectionable quantities of dirt, sand, clay, and rock fines will not be permitted. (vii)   Delivery of the riprap shall be made F.O.B. Destination to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge, Savanna District.  The delivery site is the Spring Lake Management Unit, located approximately two miles south of Savanna, Illinois, off of Hwy 84 and then two miles (gravel road) west of Hwy 84.  The delivery site is a newly rehabilitated earthen levee, so delivery is dependent upon weather, i.e. wet conditions will delay delivery.  The earthen levee is 12 feet wide, thus restricting the truck size to the delivery site, i.e., an 18 ton tandem truck load may be the maximum size that can maneuver due to the narrow access; there is not enough room on the levee for access by a semi-trailer.  The levee is 3,200 lineal feet in length that will require the delivery truck to back in reverse gear along the levee and dump each load, progressing along the entire levee.  FWS staff will spread the rock with heavy equipment as each load is dumped.  A minimum of one hour is needed between each truck load in order for the rock to be spread on the shoulder of the levee.  The riprap is to be delivered between the period of September 1 through September 30, 2007, as coordinated with the USFWS Savanna District Manager.   (viii)   The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition (FAR provisions and clauses are available for review at http://www.arnet.gov/far).  (ix)   Quotes will be evaluated and award will be made to the lowest responsive, responsible offeror submitting a fair and reasonable price and meeting the terms of this solicitation.    (x)   Each offeror shall complete, and include with its quotation, FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items. Failure to submit this provision, properly completed, may result in a non-responsive quotation.  (xi)   The FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  (xii)   FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items pertains as applicable to this acquisition.  The following FAR clauses cited in the clause are applicable to this solicitation:  52.219-6, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-1, 52.225-13, 52.232-33, and 52.232-36.    (xiii)   Contract Clause 52.211-16, Variation in Quantity, is incorporated into this solicitation.  The permissible variation is a 15% Increase/15% Decrease and is applicable to Line Item 0001. (xiv)  [N/A]  (xv)   [N/A]  (xvi)   Quotes are due to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 3, Contracting and Facilities Management Office, 1 Federal Drive, Fort Snelling, Minnesota 55111-4056 by 4:30 p.m. CDT on August 13, 2007.

All work shall be  accomplished in Building 353, Vehicle Maintenance Facility, Altus AFB OK.  

2.  PRINCIPAL FEATURES:  The work to be accomplished consists, in general, of the following principal items.  This does not mean that the work consists only of these items, but that it consists of these principal items along with all incidental minor work which becomes necessary to complete in order to accomplish the overall project in a satisfactory and workmanlike manner meeting the approval of the Contracting Officer. 

Three lifts and two maintenance bays are involved in required work plan. Three lifts and their current locations, with required work to be accomplished by the contractor are explained in the following paragraphs.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[JUN 2006] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 

Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

Inverted Domestic Corporation.  A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held? 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a  Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when
determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted

control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a  Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Background

Although the deployment of biometric technologies such ads fingerprints is becoming more widespread , little attention is being paid to the human-computer interaction that such technologies  involve. The use of biometrics will be unfamiliar to many users, who will not understand the technology, nor be comfortable with using it. Sine user behavior can affect both throughputs of the system as well as the quality of the captured images, guidelines for developing interactions with biometric applications that increase throughput and image quality would be valuable to the biometric community. This would help them develop hardware, software, and interaction techniques that would produce good quality biometrics. Designs that help end users understand the biometric hardware and process for both the participant and the operator.
The Visualization and Usability Group within the Information Access Division of The Information Technology Laboratory at NIST has established a Biometrics Usability program and had identified a number of usability factors that require verification on larger data sets to identify operational parameters for fingerprint systems. 
The contractor must have a strong technical background in fingerprint analysis and matching and the mathematics that defines fingerprint matching algorithms. A strong background in statistics and hypothesis testing in the fingerprint environment and familiarity with the previous fingerprint studies in this area is also necessary, in addition to strong technical writing ability. NIST will provide biometric source materials to the Contractor including the datasets.

The required Contract line Items s (CLINS) are:
Line Item 0001: Contractor performance and completion of Statement of Work (SOW) requirements including travel cost (if any):
Quantity: 1;  unit: Job 

Statement of Work (SOW)
The Habituation Study NIST IR 7271 (http://zing.ncsl.nist.gov/biousa/docs/WP302_theofanos/pdf demonstrated that feedback can cause major improvement in fingerprint image quality. The goats study (http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.03/pact/ir_7271.pdf)) demonstrated that frequent users of US-VISIT can usually provide matchable fingerprints. The study will test the hypothesis that the success of the Goats Study is caused by habituation.

The Contractor shall compare the match scores of each of the ten sets of fingerprints for the 6,000 subjects used in the goats study with subjects selected by the COTR with similar demographics with match scores form the NIST SDK tests. If the proposed hypothesis is true the match scores from the first use by Goats subjects should be similar to the SDK scores for users with similar demographics. This would explain the observations that repeat US-VISIT user have better image quality than first time users and should allow US-VISIT match thresholds to be modified to reduce false non-match failures for frequent users. It will also confirm the applicability of the Habituation study results to large scale operational fingerprint processing and demonstrate the importance of provided good user feedback to users of verification systems such as PIV.
The Contractor shall develop a report that describes the analysis and results of the two datasets including the mathematics and statistics that prove or disprove the described hypothesis.

The Contractor will need expertise in the following:
1. computer modeling
2. pattern recognition
3. conforming testing
4. statistical analysis of fingerprint image quality
5. biometric interoperability and accuracy testing
6. NIST/ANSI-ITL-2007 fingerprint data exchange standard
7. MINEX: performance and interoperability in INCIT 378 fingerprint templates
8. biometric data specification for personal identity verification, special publication 800-76
9. NIST software development kit testing of fingerprint matching
10. effect of image size and compression on one-to-one fingerprint matching.
11. NISAT fingerprint image quality algorithm
12. fingerprint technology evaluation 2003.     
13.matching performance for the US-VISIT-IDENT system 
14. NIST/ANSI-ITL-2000 fingerprint data exchange standard.

II.                   STATEMENT OF WORK:     
A. Purpose and Background - The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain food aid commodity and warehouse inspection services in Djibouti, Djibouti.  The government of the United States seeks a licensed contractor able to provide inspection, sampling, lab analysis and reporting services to determine the condition of food aid commodities and the effectiveness of warehouse services. 

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) procures packaged food commodities for use in export food aid programs.  The packaged commodities are transported and delivered to a warehouse facility where they are stored, pending re-delivery to a Private Voluntary Organization (PVO), UN organization or cooperating country government. The purpose of this commodity and warehouse inspection service contract is to ensure that USAID commodities are stored, and remain, in excellent condition until they are re-delivered or shipped from our contract warehouse facility. Given the inherent nature of food aid commodities, their shelf life and their storage conditions, there is a potential for loss or damage. To address this risk, the U. S. government is seeking to contract with a commodity and warehouse inspection company to provide inspection services at USAID warehouse locations.  The contractor will witness and examine stored commodities, the warehouse space and storage techniques, document the count and condition of these food aid commodities and provide a written report to the government providing the findings. The inspections performed, and reports issued, by the contractor will be used by the government to assure the proper care and storage of our commodities.  The inspections are intended to preserve the excellent condition of food aid commodities and to prevent loss, damage or infestation of food aid commodities.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Electronic Proving Ground, Fort Huachuca, Arizona is soliciting proposals for the following requirement:  Locate transmitters of RF Energy, specifically those that are potentially impa cting our authorized use of the electromagnetic spectrum and interfering with the operation of communications systems or radars and other RF sensors we use in the course of our mission.  The problem is that  traditional - direction-finding (DF) equipment requires a high duty cycle (transmitting most of the time) signal of constant power in order to triangulate and find the transmitter.  They also require that the transmitter broadcast its  energy in a relatively narrow part of the spectrum as they have a limited bandwidth in which to - tune-in -  the signal.  The problem is that most modern radio systems now use spread spectrum signals with complex, power varying modulations or pulse coding  which makes the application of these simple direction finders problematic.  Given that the RF Spectrum is a finite resource (only so many transceivers in a given area can allocated RF Frequencies until they simply run out) it can be assumed that the numbe r of RF interference incidents will continue to grow as  - wireless - devices proliferate both commercially and in the military inventory.  The ability to identify the emitter generating the interference is the first step in resolving the problem, as in th e future we will not longer be able to simply move to another  - unoccupied -  frequency. As a result EPG needs a direction finding system that is able to acquire an  instantaneous -  line of bearing (direction) on an intermittent, spectrum hopping signal  without relying on moving, directional antennas, rather using an  - Adcock -  array of elements or similar time-of-arrival or interferometer based approach.  This kind of a DF system has the ability to  - catch -  short duration spread-spectrum hopping sy stems, and provide  - real-time -  DF capabilities, allowing on-the-move collection to rapidly triangulate a given position using a single mobile DF system.  This system must also be able to  -  search -  across broad portions of the RF spectrum and automa tically identify (classify) all transmission above a certain level and export the meta-data about the identified signals (frequency, emission types, levels and bearings) to file for further analysis.  Requirements:   a mobile direction finding system that can:  Scan from 30Mhz to 3GHz Minimum, with 6GHz or higher adding value; Digitize the spectrum using a real time bandwidth of 10MHz or more; Includes an antenna array covering the full frequency range mounted on a vehicle such as a van or SUV and rated for wind speeds up to 150mph; Scan either a specific list of frequencies or set of frequencies ranges or monitor a single fixed frequency window in real-time; Be remotely controlled to allow  - command center -  to automatically configure the DF mission; Display th e spectral data in  - real-time -  showing frequency, power, time and bearing in a graphical display that integrates the data visually and allows the operator to quickly identify key signal characteristics and  - refocus -  the DF mission on potential inte rfering signals; Operate either stand-alone, combining multiple bearings over time into a triangulated fix or in conjunction with similar units to perform  -  instant -  triangulation.  Display the lines-of-bearing on a map display along with triangulated  - fixes - ; Integrate GPS Timing and Positioning from an on-board GPS system into the data collection so that multiple units can integrate their data; Classify received signals and reco rd their meta-data (frequency, emi ssion type, bandwidth, amplitude and bearing for example) into files or over a streaming connection to allow further analysis; The vehicle should be 4-wheel-drive capable of driving through rough terrain. Preferably a diesel power train; Vehicle should inc lude native electrical power generation sufficient to power all instrumentation for at least a 24hr period; Vehicle must be able to run from  - Shore Power -  or externally provided AC power source 110v and/or 220v; Vehicle must include air-conditioning an d heating to allow operation in extreme environments; Vehicle must include a class III trailer hitch to allow it to tow when required.   FOB DESTINATION:  Fort Huachuca, Arizona.  Payment will be made by Government credit card under Net 30 Terms. Offers ar e due no later than 12 noon, Mountain Standard Time, Wednesday, 8 August 2007.

<DESC>****Amendment 01 is to add the Model number for the Vacuum Gravity microcomputer-controlled Steam Sterilizer. The Model number is Model 533LS. All questions about this solicitation should be in writing and sent to London.Johnson@fda.hhs.gov*****

The United States Food and Drug Administration?s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)/Division of Product Quality in the Office of Vaccines Research and Review is seeking offers for a vacuum/gravity, microcomputer-controlled steam sterilizer.  The procurement should be delivered as a unit. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items (as defined by FAR 2.101) prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  A written request for quotations will not be issued.  This acquisition is subject to FAR Subpart 13.5 regarding the application of simplified acquisition procedures.  This acquisition is issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) FDA-SOL-07-00338. All responsible business sources may submit an offer that will be considered.  The NAICS code is 334516. The small business size standard is 500 employees. This is NOT a small business set-aside.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18.  Offers in response to this RFQ shall be submitted by 3:00 p.m. EDT, August 13, 2007.  Quotes and questions shall be submitted via electronic mail to: Mrs. London Johnson. The email address is London.Johnson@fda.hhs.gov. This is an unrestricted solicitation. Offerors shall bid on ALL or NONE of the items identified in this solicitation.  The following information contains notations regarding special features of this unit.  A) TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: the chamber inside, which should be a measurement of 21" x 21" x 38" is required to accommodate trays of vials for reagent preparation.  This unit must have multiple pre-programmed cycles and vertical sliding door to accommodate space limitations in the Reagent Preparation area.  The unit must be equipped to perform cycles that include gravity, vacuum, liquid cycles and a Vacuum Leak Test cycle.  The unit must have operating displays that are easily understood and visible in the controlled environmental area.  Programmed cycle settings are protected with only authorized supervisors having access control.  The size is critical at this time, as a limited amount of space in new construction has been allocated for the unit; the unit must have a vertical sliding door that minimizes space requirements for the door swing in a controlled environmental area.  This unit shall be microprocessor-controlled, automatic steam sterilizer designed to sterilize heat and moisture-stabile laboratory, research and animal care supplies using gravity or downward displacement with positive pulsing conditioning for dynamic air removal, and sterilize liquids in self-venting or unsealed containers using controlled exhaust for linear and consistent cool down.  The temperature range is selectable from 110C to 135C (230F to 275F), for liquid cycles from 104C to 135C(219F to 275F.) which is necessary to sterilize many types of packaged goods such as vials, stoppers and instruments. Construction of this unit is of 316Ti stainless steel sectional U channels (jacket) welded around the 316Ti stainless steel inner chamber vessel.  The vessel can withstand working pressure of 45 psig and full vacuum.  Welded construction complies with ASME Code Section VIII division 1, U1 stamped vessel to allow installation into renovated area.  A stainless steel frame will rigidly support the pressure chamber and allow for some variance in height as the unit has adjustable feet; this will be a distinct advantage in the incorporation of the unit into the construction. The unit is equipped with a safety valve (ASME approved and so stamped) for pressure vessel which is set at the approved maximum operating pressure of the vessel.  The valve is sealed so that setting cannot be altered, and will blow down at least 2 psig before closing.  The valve is sized so that pressure in vessel will not rise more than 10 percent over the set pressure.  This unit as described is equipped with a Cross Contamination Barrier (CCB) designed to maintain air differential between the controlled environment where vials are prepared and the outside service areas.  A steel flange will be fully welded to load side of the sterilizer. The manufacturer of the unit supplies stainless steel sheet metal paneling to span distance from flange plate to wall opening and seals the flange plate/wall junction with silicone caulking compound, creating the required barrier separation.  The unit is also equipped with a safety and cross contamination door interlock to prevent the door from opening until successful completion of cycle. This unit is equipped with a vertical sliding Manual Door with the following properties to conserve space in the controlled environment where the vials are packaged.  Additionally, the door is constructed of 316Ti Stainless Steel plate and reinforced to withstand pressure and vacuum without deflection or leakage. A silicon rubber O ring gasket is self compensating and housed in a 316Ti stainless steel channel as part of chamber end ring. Gasket shall be easily replaced without the use of tools. The vertical sliding door is counterbalanced for ease of operation.  When open, it is totally out of the way, allowing safe and complete access to the chamber with the trays of vials.  Opening or closing the manual door requires only gentle upward or downward hand pressure. The installer insures that the exterior of the sterilizers and door(s) shall be covered with a minimum of 1.5" fiberglass insulation. Sterilizer is equipped with one standard chamber instrumentation port so in-house validation can be performed as needed.  This port is provided to facilitate insertion of test equipment and instrumentation leads. Microcomputer controls are PACS 3000 with cycles preprogrammed specifically designed for clean room facilities.  Controls are fabricated using state-of-the-art PLC technology.  The PACS 3000 controller incorporates F sub 0 functions as part of the software base and utilizes connected printed circuit boards (Control and Printer). The control side is provided with OP30 operating panels; the display is a 5.7 inch diagonal color screen.  Control panel(s) with touch pads and digital printer are located above  the chamber. Program control is subject to Cycle Backup so that, in case of a power failure, the back-up system holds cycle in phase for up to 1 minute until power is restored from Generators at the NLRC facility.  When power returns, event is recorded on printout and cycle resumes or restarts, depending on what phase cycle was in at time of power failure. The program microcomputer monitors and controls all phases of separate steam sterilizing cycles. Temperature display on the printer and and printout units may be recorded or observed either degrees F or degrees C; pressure display in psig/in Hg or Bars, and time either standard AM/PM or Military format.  In the laboratory mode of operation, sterilize temperature overdrive, over-temperature point, under-temperature point and chamber pressure points can be set by the operator. The printer must be capable of providing a duplicate print switch to furnish a duplicate printout of entire cycle data (when unit is not in cycle) or of current cycle status (during a cycle).  For validation purposes, the printout must have the with date, cycle count, daily cycle number, starting time of each cycle, sterilize temperature selected, sterilize and dry time selected, key transition points in the cycle, and any deviations which may jeopardize sterilization process. Piping used must be copper and brass threaded with standard National Pipe Thread and sealed with pipe sealant prior to tightening. Piping, fittings and connections required to connect the sterilizer to building supply lines are by others. B) INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS: The installer shall provide the following with the unit: 1) Wall trim panels 2) Boiler Control and Safety Device (CSD-1). Satisfies state ASME requirements for secondary low water cut-off as required by local jurisdiction.), 3) 304 Stainless Steel piping for clean steam Tissue Culture applications.  (Required house steam to jacket) 4) Thermocouple Gland, 5) Load RTD for temperature control of a liquid load, 6) Vacuum Pump (533LS w/ house steam only), and 7) Automatic Steam Boiler Blowdown C) UTILITY REQUIREMENTS: 1) Plant Steam Supply: 3/4 inch (19) NPT, 40-50 psig, 96 lbs/hr, 2) Cold Water: 3/4 inch (19) NPT, 30-60 psig, 6 gpm, 3) Compressed Air: 1/4inch(7) NPT, 70-100 psig dynamic, 1 SCFM, 4) Drain:1/2 inch (38) ODT, 5) Electric:1/2 inch (13), 115V, 50/60 Hz, and 6) Hot Water:1/2 inch (13) NPT, 20-50 psig (min.), 0.4 gpm. The unit shall carry a one (1) year warranty for parts and labor and the ASME pressure vessel will carry a fifteen (15) year warranty for workmanship or structural failure.  D) LINE ITEMS AND COST REQUIREMENTS: 1) INSTALLATION, 2) PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PLAN, 3) TOTAL CARE PLAN, 4) STEAM FILTER PACKAGE, 5) VACUUM GRAVITY MICROCOMPUTER-CONTROLLED STEAM STERILIZER.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the due date and time for the receipt of proposals and past performance questionnaires and to respond to questions submitted by potential offerors.  

1. The due date and time for the receipt of proposals and past performance questionnaires is extended to 8/6/07 at 10:00 a.m. EST.  

2. Responses to questions are provided below.

Question 1: Will a separate CLIN be established for Task D.1 (Project Management)?

Response:  No. Any anticipated costs associated with the Project Management task should be factored into the firm fixed price proposed for CLINs 0001 and 0101.

Question 2: According to the RFP, CLIN 0001 will be firm fixed price and CLIN 0002 will be labor hours.  Is the Government asking for an hourly rate to be quoted for both? Please clarify if possible.  

Response: The Government is not asking for an hourly rate for CLINs 0001 or 0101, which are firm fixed priced.  In proposing pricing for performance under these CLINs the offeror will identify a firm fixed unit price per month and multiply the unit price by 12.  The Government IS asking for an hourly rate for CLINs 0002 and 0102, which are labor hour CLINs.  In proposing pricing for performance under these CLINs the offeror will identify an hourly rate and multiply it by 960 hours.

Question 3: Is [this] solicitation a new requirement or is there an incumbent?  Also, is there a contractor currently performing similar work?

Response: There is an incumbent currently performing this work.

All other terms and conditions of the solicitation remain unchanged.

The respose date for this combined synopsis/soliciation is extended to 7 Aug 2007 NLT 1600 hrs. The following were questions submitted after site visit:
Q.  Do the walls have to be vacuumed each visit? It is normal and customary practice to brush walls as needed and vacuum the floor of the pool if debris is visible. 
A The pool sides and floor will require periodic brushing in addition to the cleaning the robotic cleaner performs. The floor and walls will be scrubbed by the robotic cleaner once it is received. Anything missed by the robotic cleaner or stains beyond the cleaner's ability will require cleaning. This applies to both the floor and walls of the pool. The gutters will need to be cleaned and the scum line at water level scrubbed. Any accumulated debris will also have to be removed. Any debris on pool deck i.e. pine needles would also need to be cleared up and the pool deck swept
Q.  If the pool is to be chlorinated by tablet feeders which tablets will be used, stabilized or non-stablized? (since the facility has 2 tower chlorinators it is possible to use both)
A.  The Government plans on supplying the chemicals needed.  The contractor will be required to provide a listing and estimated quantities of chemicals required each month.
Q.  Will you require bids for one, two and three visits per week?
A.  Bids should be made for once and twice a week. Once the robotic cleaner is in place only one cleaning per week will be required. 
Q.  What chemicals is the pool contractor required to supply?
A.  The Government plans on supplying the chemicals needed.  The contractor will be required to provide a listing and estimated quantities of chemicals required each month. 
Q.  Does it matter what time of day the pool is serviced?
A.  The pool will need to be serviced in the afternoon as training is always conducted in the morning. We may need to be flexible, at some point in the future there might be larger classes and training might occur later in the day. 
Q.  Is there a requirement for liability insurance and pool/spa operator certification?
A.  The Contractors will need liability insurance.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number N860010-7-05927rs is issued as a request for quotation. No set-aside is identified for this RFP. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541990. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has a requirement for technical support services described below.  The Performance Based Statement of Work is as follows:

I.	BACKGROUND:
The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) studies building materials; computer-integrated construction practices; fire science and fire safety engineering; and structural, mechanical, and environmental engineering. Products of the laboratory's research include measurements and test methods, performance criteria, and technical data that support innovations by industry and are incorporated into building and fire standards and codes. One of BFRL?s major program areas is Healthy and Sustainable Buildings, to which the Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability (BEES) software project is a major contributor.  BEES uses the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach to evaluate the environmental performance of products based on life-cycle inventory (LCI) data compiled by LCA practitioners for more than 500 environmental flows including raw materials and energy use, air emissions, water effluent, and solid waste. 

NIST takes a lead role, with its BEES software, database, and methods, in providing guidance to the building community on the life cycle environmental and economic performance of products.  Reliable, consistent LCI data are key to BEES success. 

II.	SCOPE OF WORK:
With this contract, NIST seeks to take a first step beyond evaluation of building products and simple building product systems toward evaluation of entire facilities. The scope of this contract is limited to commercial and residential buildings. 

The primary objective of this contract is for a Contractor to develop a mapping framework to directly connect an existing, or readily-adaptable, Input/Output (I/O)-based LCI framework with the fixed, BEES-based LCI framework.  The Contractor is encouraged to propose an innovative and effective methodology to map BEES life cycle flows.

The deliverable for this contract is a spreadsheet indicating how to convert I/O-based LCI results into the BEES impact assessment framework. This deliverable will be reviewed and incorporated by the NIST COTR in the research activities of the BFRL Metrics and Tools for Sustainable Buildings Program. The Contractor may propose and justify an alternative deliverable for Government approval.  The goal of the deliverable is to effectively and efficiently convert I/O LCI results into the BEES-based LCI framework.  The objective is to enable evaluation I/O LCI results through the twelve BEES impact assessment methods.

The expected outcome is the ability to estimate, in a consistent, transparent manner, the environmental performance of commercial and residential buildings 

Period of Performance - The period of performance is from date of award through 29 FEB 2008.

III.	SPECIFIC TASKS:
The Contractor shall develop a mapping framework for converting I/O-based LCI results into the BEES impact assessment framework. Specific tasks include:

1.	Select a robust, transparent U.S. IO-LCA database.  Publicly or commercially available documentation shall exist for the selected database that provides detailed, transparent information on its compilation.  Robustness shall be demonstrated by reference to at least two independent, 3rd-party reviews of the selected database. 

2.	Map the LCI flows produced as output of the selected IO-LCA database to the BEES LCI flows. Attached is an Excel file (PWS Attachment #1) giving the fixed BEES LCI flow list, the environmental media to which they refer, and the units in which they are expressed. 

3.	Document matched flows. For IO-LCA database flows with direct, or convertible, mappings to BEES flows, document the match. See the ?Matched Flows? tab of  PWS Attachment #2; the cells highlighted in yellow are those that are to be completed for all matched flows. As shown in the attachment, for each matched flow, list the corresponding flow from the selected IO-LCA database. Provide the units in which the IO-LCA database reports these corresponding flows, as well as their CAS Registry numbers if they exist.

4.	Document unmatched flows. For IO-LCA database flows without direct or convertible mappings to BEES flows, document the matching failure. See the ?Unmatched Flows? tab of  PWS Attachment #2; the cells highlighted in yellow are those that are to be completed for all unmatched flows. As shown in the attachment, documentation includes type of mismatch between BEES flows and IO-LCA flows and suggested work-around, other suggestion as to how to handle the unmatch, or justification for ignoring the BEES flow (e.g., insignificant--x %- contribution to all 12 BEES environmental impacts)


NOTE: For PBSW attachments # 1 & #2 may be obtained by sending an e-mail request to thee acquisition specialist identified below.


IV.	DELIVERABLES AND REPORTS: 
Report outputs?describe what is to be included in the reports: 
The deliverable for Task 1 is a 1-page written summary, provided as an electronic MS Word document, justifying the IO-LCA database selection. Any external, written reviews of the detailed data shall be provided. 

The deliverable for Tasks 2 through 4 is PWS Attachment # 2, with cells highlighted in yellow on the ?Matched Flows? and ?Unmatched Flows? tabs completed. PWS Attachment # 2 shall be provided as an electronic MS Excel file. An alternative deliverable for Tasks 2 through 4 may be submitted upon Government?s approval of the Contractor?s proposal.

V.	DELIVERABLE DUE DATES AND/OR PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:

Tasks 1 through 5: MS Word document justifying IO-LCA database selection and MS Excel spreadsheet documenting the BEES vs. IO-LCA database matching tasks due within 5 months of contract award

Period of Performance for this task: Date of award through February 2008.

VI.	EXHIBITS AND ATTACHMENTS:
Two MS Excel files, Attachment #1 illustrating the BEES LCI flow list and Attachment #2 showing the format of the deliverable for Tasks 2 through 4, are available via e-mail.  Contact Ray Staniewski at raymond.staniewski@nist.gov and reference this solicitation number and simply request the two additional excel spreadsheets for this solicitation.

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted.  The due date for quotations, 3:30 PM Local Time on August 3, 2007, remains unchanged.

QUESTION: The section regarding EXPOSURE OPTICS references the system, "Must be capable of achieving at least a 600 nanometer diameter spot size at the wafer plane."
  In relation to requested exposure wavelength of 450 nanometers, can more details be provided to clarify the relationship between the two requirements.  The 600nm number is very small for the requirement as the mathematical workings of the wavelengths are not working.

RESPONSE: In a general sense, the minimum spot size diameter is proportional to the laser wavelength times the focal length divided by the beam diameter.  The requested exposure wavelength merely indicates the desire for a laser diode which currently have minimum wavelengths at 405 nm.

The request is therefore that the optical train used for the system be designed to minimize the focal length while maximizing the beam diameter to the lens in order to achieve a spot size of at least 600 nm.  Of course using a laser with shorter wavelength would be beneficial, but currently I believe the minimum wavelength available is the 405 nm stated in the RFQ.

Question 13:  CLIN 0005 states 400HZ/208V/15KW as a minimum.  This is a 3 phase not to be confused with a 60HZ, single phase.  Rationale for this size is that the government requests one ECU versus multiple ECU's per shelter.
