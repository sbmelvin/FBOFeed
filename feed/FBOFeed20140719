Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for a commercial acquisition. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice or reimburse the costs incurred by potential offerors in providing the information requested herein.<br /><br />
<p>Accordingly, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Coast Survey, Navigation Services Division, and Eastern Acquisition Division is conducting market research to determine potential sources capable of scientific research into bathymetric radar and the Variational Assimilation Algorithm as detailed herein:</p>
<p>The intent of this announcement and the information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in identify <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL </span></strong>potential sources to include small businesses and socio-economic sources that are capable and qualified to furnish the required boats identified in the Requirements section of this announcement. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences. The small business size standard for this NAICS code is 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>NOAA is trying to understand the potential for its mission of the Variational Assimilation Algorithm approach to X-Band bathymetric radar.  Contractor is to investigate the physics and mathematics of the algorithm using analysis and/or experimentation as appropriate in order to assess its performance as a means of determining water depth from X-Band radar data for use in nautical charting.  In order to thoroughly investigate the Varitation Assimilation algorithm potential contractors must have the knowledge, skills and abilities to accomplish the following:</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1.	Compare the performance of the variational assimilation algorithm with existing, bathymetric radar data extraction algorithms for depth and position.<br /><br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2.	Determine the actual performance of the variational assimilation algorithm using bathymetric radar data depth and position algorithms over a range of algorithm parameters, e.g. signal-to-noise ratio, environmental, and radar parameters.<br /><br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3.	Determine the theoretical and practical limits of horizontal resolution and accuracy of bathymetric radar retrievals assuming linear wave dispersion and compare it to that of the variational assimilation algorithm.<br /><br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>4.	Determine the suitability of exploiting time-averaged radar backscatter intensity fields to identify the location of obstructions and shallow bathymetric features, e.g. shoals.<br /><br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>5.	Characterize the depth and position measuring performance of bathymetric radar for long dwell times.<br /><br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>6.	Hypothesize, develop and characterize additional depth and position measuring algorithms and models for using X-Band radar as a hydrographic surveying tool as indicated from the research performed here.</p>
<p>Firms who believe they have the capabilities to provide the required research, <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">MUST</span> furnish detailed information concerning their capabilities. Submitted Capability Statements shall include the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>(1) Company name and address<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>(2) DUNS number<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>(3) Type of business (e.g., large business, small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and/or women owned small business, as validated via the System for Award Management (SAM))<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>(4) Company point of contact - name, phone and email address<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>(5) Demonstration of the capabilities for providing the required research as detailed herein.</p>
<p>Standard brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this notice.</p>
<p>Interested sources shall submit an electronic copy of their Capability Statement to Robin Resweber, Contract Specialist, via email at Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov, no later than 10:00 AM. Eastern Standard Time (EST) July 28, 2014. Responses will not be returned.

However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE:</p>
<p>A security pre-clearance must be performed for any employees referred to HIS through this contract.<br />Fingerprints must be completed and adjudicated prior to services being performed under this contract.<br />No contract award shall be made to any vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov throughout the duration of the contract. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the acquisition official if there is a change in provider.<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer. In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.<br />The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.<br />Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>
