<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA ombudsmen, Air Force Test Center Vice Commander, 1 South Rosamond Blvd, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-3784, phone number (661) 277-2810, facsimile number (661) 277-7593. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA level, may be brought by the interested party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (571) 256-2397, facsimile number (571) 256-2431.<br /><br />(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. <br /><br />(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>This is a market survey/sources sought for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey/sources sought or otherwise pay for information solicited. The Government will utilize the information provided only to develop the acquisition strategy for future requirements. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources, specifically small business sources, capable of manufacturing and delivering the following item: M22 Simulator, Cartridge, ATWESS (Anti-Tank Weapons Effect Signature Simulator), NSN: 1370-01-085-2601, DODIC: L367. <br>  <br> The M22 ATWESS consists of a percussion primer, first fire composition, flash composition, plastic case and other plastic parts. This simulator is used to replicate anti-tank guided missile and rocket launches when used in conjunction with a launching apparatus in a training environment. Upon ignition, the cartridge will produce a bright flash, loud report and smoke. The following functional characteristics are required for the M22 ATWESS: Temperature: shall function between 125 5 F and -25 5 F; Flash: flash signature shall be a minimum of six feet in length and two feet in width with duration of 40 to 500 milliseconds; Sound: sound intensity shall be 134 +6 -7 decibels for a maximum duration of 15 milliseconds with a rise time of 5 milliseconds. The flash composition currently contains 75% magnesium powder, 10% PTFE and 15% fluoroelastomer; however, the Government is pursuing a moisture resistant non-magnesium based flash composition for permanent replacement. The pyrotechnic composition is enclosed in a plastic tube inside a plastic case and sealed off with an end plate and a switch closure at either side. Top level drawing 12953563 is being provided with this sources sought/market survey. No further drawings or specifications will be provided at this time. <br>  <br> Interested companies should respond by providing the Government the following information in the time-frame established below: a brief summary of the company's capabilities; description of facilities, business size as it applies to NAICS code 325920, Explosives Manufacturing - size standard 750 employees; personnel and related manufacturing experience; estimated minimum and maximum monthly production quantities with associated prices and lead-times; whether any of the items are currently in production or when last produced; the minimum procurement quantity (MPQ) required for economical production; and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for a quantity of 130,000 M22 ATWESS. Additionally, interested companies should note if manufacturing resources are shared with other item/production lines and identify the approximate amount shared. A respondent to this market survey must have available a majority of the skills that are required to manufacture these items. If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate and should describe his or her ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria. All contractors interested in this potential future solicitation must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) Database.  <br>  <br> Potential Production Concern: The composition of the pellet assembly is currently under reformulation and will be provided with the release of the Request for Proposal (RFP). While completing the R&D portion of the product improvement effort, a production concern surfaced with regard to the composition blending process.  During small scale production, the new composition proved successful and the simulator performed according to the specifications. However, when moving to a larger production batch there appeared to be issues with uniform pellet density and homogenous blending, which led to simulator degradation. The simulator did not function properly, causing excess venting which ultimately broke the launching device. This blending/venting issue may simply have been an anomaly caused by an unknown variable in the R&D environment. However, the Government is bringing the concern to the attention of potentially interested parties in an effort to ascertain whether it has any impact on willingness to bid on the RFP. <br>  <br> Interested firms have 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to submit information to be considered in the development of the acquisition strategy for this item. Any response to this market research should reference the following: M22 Simulator, Cartridge, ATWESS (Anti-Tank Weapons Effect Signature Simulator) Market Survey. Please submit to Kurt L.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research. This is a Request for Information only. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified 8(a) small business sources. This work was previously competing in the 8(a) small business environment and must remain with an 8(a) contractor.</p>
<p>Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) Program is one of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) quality improvement programs that serves to improve the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries. One of the primary statutory missions of the Program, as set forth in the Social Security Act (referred to as the "Act") is to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, economy, and quality of services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>As a general matter, Section 1862(g) of the Social Security Act mandates that the Secretary enter into contracts with the QIOs, private businesses, for the purpose of determining that Medicare services are reasonable and medically necessary, for the purposes of promoting the effective, efficient, and economical delivery of health care services, and of promoting the quality of services of the type for which payment may be made under Medicare.</p>
<p>To meet these goals, QIOs, review health care services funded under Title XVIII of the Act (Medicare) to determine whether those services are reasonable, medically necessary, furnished in the appropriate setting, and meet professionally recognized standards of quality. Additionally, QIOs conduct reviews in response to Medicare beneficiaries' (or their representative) complaints about their quality of care or when appealing the termination of Medicare covered services or hospital discharge.</p>
<p>One method CMS has used to measure whether the QIOs are effectively meeting their mission is to survey Medicare beneficiaries directly served by the QIO. CMS will again utilize a contractor to conduct the Medicare beneficiary experience survey activity. This includes sharing QIO-specific survey data with the QIOs for use in their on-going quality improvement efforts to better serve Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p><br />The Medicare beneficiary experience survey measures the beneficiaries' experience with the QIO for quality of care and appeals' of termination of services or discharge and provides CMS with a formal method to obtain direct feedback from beneficiaries regarding the effectiveness of the QIO program. More specifically, the surveys measure how satisfied Medicare beneficiaries (or their representative) are with the services performed by the QIO, particularly services and or duties preformed during the beneficiary complaint and/or appeals process.</p>
<p>II. OBJECTIVES</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI): <br />Electronic Warfare Infrastructure Improvement Program (EWIIP)<br />Decision Analysis Support (DAS)<br />
<p>SPR 2013-793<br /><br />I. SUMMARY</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes (FAR 15.201(e)) as part of a market survey led by the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Warfare Analysis and Integration Department (AIR-4.10). Under the PSC Code of AC64, for R&amp;D- Defense System: Electronics/Communication Equipment (Engineering Development) and NAICS code of 541330 for Engineering Services with a Size Standard of $14.0M. This is NOT a Request for Proposals. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>In May 2013 OSD (AT&amp;L) signed an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) assigning the Secretary of the Navy to serve as lead for a joint project, which will operate under the auspices of the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program's Enhanced Electronic Warfare (EW) Test Resource Project. The project is to provide upgraded open-loop and closed-loop threat simulator test assets. Direction was provided so the project could be managed and structured with a "strong sense of urgency". Additionally in May 2013, the Test Resource Management Center directed the Navy to develop a draft Test Capabilities Requirements Document for both open-loop and closed-loop simulator devices.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) established the Electronic Warfare Infrastructure Improvement Project (EWIIP) Advanced Development Project Office (ADPO). In support of the EWIIP ADPO, AIR 4.10 was engaged to execute a Decision Analysis Support (DAS). Objectives of which include, but are not limited to: (1) generate and record a decision making process, (2) gather and assess technical and engineering data, (3) assist with refinement of cost estimates, and (4) survey industry's ability to meet requirements. This support will assist with determining: "What is an affordable threat simulator design that satisfies developmental and operational testing requirements and meets schedule needs for multiple acquisition programs across their acquisition cycles and also addresses projected training capability needs to the maximum extent practical?"</p>
<p>The DAS Team is aware of previous industry engagement efforts and currently has access to, among other things, the February 2013 Advanced Radar Threat System Variant 1 (ARTS v1) RFI and the 2012 effort entitled "High-Power Ground Radar Emulator (HPGRE) Trade Study" responses from industry. The DAS Team will fully leverage the data on file related to these efforts. Additionally, the Navy will monitor the ongoing High Power Ground Threat Emitter (HPGTE) Analysis of Alternatives for open-loop solutions chartered by the Threat Systems Management Office.</p>
<p>Due to the "strong sense of urgency", the timeline for this information request is knowingly aggressive.</p>
<p>The RFI objectives include, but are not limited to: alignment of industry knowledge with current requirements for both open and closed-loop systems, allow industry to modify/update existing proposed solutions, as deemed necessary, and provide industry with additional programmatic (cost and schedule) and technical information.</p>
<p>Responses are encouraged from industry, academia, and any other government organizations.</p>
<p>Responses should provide data regarding a complete system descriptor that addresses the primary requirements discussed below. Responses should also address enabling technologies at the subsystem level for potential integration with other developer's subsystems based on their ability to meet the final system requirements.</p>
<p>The EWIIP ADPO primary requirements include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and field 20 Open-Loop RF Signal Emulators at Open Air Test Ranges <br />o High-power, re-programmable, re-locatable systems<br />o Emulate S, C, X-Band threats <br />o 6 "S-Band" Electronically Scanned Arrays (ESAs), 6 "C-Band" ESAs, 8 Wide-Band Dish (ESAs can be either Passive or Active, but need to emulate a Passive ESA, or the ESAs could be replaced with available technologies that can emulate execution of electronic beam steering)<br />&bull; Develop and field 3 "Multi-threat" C-Band ESA (ESA can be Passive or Active, but need to emulate a Passive ESA) Closed-Loop SAM Simulators at Open Air Test Ranges<br />o Very high fidelity detect and track capabilities</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the EWIIP ADPO is also specifically interested in other technology options for the execution of electronic beam steering.</p>
<p>Within these primary requirements, the EWIIP DAS team will be assessing the tradespace between cost, capability, and schedule.</p>
<p>Respondents are strongly requested to delineate clearly in the response (especially the data templates in the Government Furnished Information (GFI) package described in the below section) which concept option(s) the data corresponds to. This will allow the EWIIP DAS study team to swiftly utilize the respondent's information and accurately characterize tradespace options.</p>
<p>We cannot over emphasize the sense of urgency with this effort. To that end, extensions on the deadlines will not be granted.</p>
<p>The EWIIP DAS team will be hosting an industry day on October 3rd and 4th to answer any questions and to provide further information.</p>
<p><br />II. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED INFORMATION (GFI)</p>
<p>More comprehensive information including the following will be provided in two separate correspondences after receipt of the letter of intent (LOI) and a signed GFI Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is returned as provided with this FEDBIZ OPS announcement. Please see Section IV Response, Submittal, and Instructions for more information on the LOI. The first correspondence package will be unclassified and will be sent via FEDEX on approximately 16 September 2013. It will include:</p>
<p>&bull; Supplemental Questions (Technical, Cost, Schedule, CONOPS)<br />&bull; EWIIP Draft OV-1<br />&bull; Acquisition Strategy Options<br />&bull; DD-254 with the appropriate Security Classification Guides (SCGs). Please see Section IV. Response, Submittal, and Instructions for more information on timelines/cases for use<br />&bull; Templates for Cost &amp; Technical data to assist the EWIIP DAS team to quickly summarize the concept(s) information<br />&bull; Technology Maturity Assessment (TMA) Technology Maturity Self-Assessment (TMSA) Technical Work Breakdown Structure (TWBS) Template (see below for explanation).</p>
<p>For each System Concept, we request the respondent to provide a fully-populated self-contained Critical Technology Element (CTE) TMSA TWBS. This Government provided, via the unclassified GFI, Excel-based template is a tool by which the NAVAIR Independent Technical Review Office (ITRO) will conduct a TMA on each identified System Concept provided in response to this RFI. The TMSA TWBS tool defines a methodical approach to decompose each identified System Concept into various lower levels of indenture to identify those subsystems, components, and even devices that may contain enabling technologies that may be considered a CTE. Each identified candidate CTE is subsequently assessed a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) in accordance with the DoD approved System/Hardware TRLs and Software TRLs, which are provided in a separate tab in the TMSA TWBS spreadsheet. Guidance for populating the TMSA TWBS is also provided in another tab in the spreadsheet. For each identified candidate CTE, a Technology Maturation Plan (TMP) is required in the space provide at the bottom of the spreadsheet. The TMP identifies those test events and demonstrations required to mature the immature technologies as well as a time line when the TRL will be expected to progress from the originally assessed TRL to higher TRL levels.</p>
<p>The team will also provide a second classified GFI package that will include:</p>
<p>&bull; Relevant intelligence technical data<br />&bull; Requirements white paper template</p>
<p>This package will be mailed on or about 19 September via FEDEX.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager for Combat Training Instrumentation Systems (PM CTIS), has a validated requirement to field an additional 1700 Data Communications Interface (DCI) devices and associated cables to the U.S. Army's Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC) at Hohenfels, Germany.    <br>  <br> A CTIS project team fielded the initial capability of DCIs to JMRC in 2009.  The DCI is a device that links (interfaces) the fielded Precision Real-Time Location System (PRTLS) radio, i.e., a Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA)-based, Sepura Model 8000 radio with tailored firmware specific for JMRC use, with Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) Tactical Engagement Simulation System (TESS) devices.   <br>  <br> Together, the PRTLS radio and DCI form a Player Unit (PU) that can determine and transmit its player's position location data to the JMRC Instrumentation System (JMRC-IS) .  In addition, when connected to a dismount or vehicle mount TESS device, MILES event data is relayed to the JMRC-IS. For a complete system description and cable diagram refer to the attached Interface Control Document (ICD) 706014-G. <br>  <br> Accordingly, the  PRTLS-DCI PUs are an integral part of the JMRC-IS which collects, processes, displays, and stores training performance data from Soldiers performing live, collective training at the JMRC.  The PUs perform an essential function in these training exercises by collecting training data from vehicles and dismounted Soldiers, and relaying that information to the Core of the JMRC-IS for use in monitoring the training exercise and providing After Action Review (AAR) feedback to the Soldiers in training.    <br>  <br> The DCI is a unique item developed to work specifically with the fielded PRTLS radio on the JMRC-IS's TETRA-based Range Data Measurement Subsystem (RDMS) network.  The original contractor, Raytheon Technical Services Company (RTSC), executed the 2009 project to adapt the Sepura radio for use as the PRTLS and also developed the compatible DCIs to provide an affordable and effective solution that operates on the existing communications network to satisfy the JMRC requirements for training performance data from the exercise players. <br>  <br> The Government plans to procure 1700 DCIs plus accessories as detailed below: <br>    <br> (1)	1700 total DCI device assemblies and associated cables/mounts, compatible with the JMRC Instrumentation System in the following quantities: <br>  <br> a.	1,000  Solider Individual Weapons Systems (IWS) <br> b.	700 Vehicle Detection Device (VDD) <br>  <br> (2)	1,000 cables to connect DCI to dismounted-Soldier IWS and battery. <br> (3)	1,000 cables to connect DCI to PRTLS radio in IWS configuration. <br> (4)	700 cables to connect DCI to VDD. <br> (5)	700 cables to connect DCI to PRTLS radio in vehicle configuration. <br> (6)	700 cables to connect PRTLS radio to its antenna while radio is emplaced in the mounting container.  <br> (7)	700 vehicle mounting containers. <br> (8)	One-year DCI warranty; options for two and three additional years. <br> (9)	10% Spares of DCI's device assemblies and associated cables/mounts in both IWS and VDD configurations <br>  <br> DCI form factor and performance requirements: <br>  <br> (a)	Maximum dimensions - 1.5in (H) x 5in (W) x 3in (L)  <br> (b)	Maximum weight - 0.5 pounds  <br> (c)	Minimum Processor -  800Mhz   <br> (d)	Minimum memory - 512MB SDRAM and 512MB Flash  <br>  <br> Other Requirements: <br>  <br> (a)	Delivery Schedule/Period of Performance:  Delivery to JMRC, Hohenfels, Germany no later than (NLT) nine months after award.  Approximately 10 percent of the units will be delivered to the Government as a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) within four months after contract award.  <br>  <br> (b)	The DCI devices and associated cables shall be backwards compatible with the existing PRTLS and communication infrastructure.    <br>  <br> (c)	The DCI assembly shall be mountable inside the tactical vehicle upon vehicle form fit inspection. <br>  <br> (d)	The installation and testing of the equipment at the JMRC cannot interfere with the training operations; therefore, the vendor will need to work around the training rotation schedule.  The vendor should consider the need to work with the JMRC Life Cycle Contractor Support (LCCS) contractor, Hohenfels, Germany.  The LCCS contractor is the Subject Matter Expert (SME) for the JMRC-IS, including the fielded PRTLS and the communications infrastructure. The LCCS contractor also maintains the JMRC-IS software, and is the only one allowed to modify the software.  If any software documentation must be modified, such as Interface Control Documents, the vendor must work with the LCCS contractor to update these documents. <br>  <br> (e)	The contractor will prepare test plans and conduct Government-witnessed testing to verify correct functionality and compatibility of the DCI with the fielded PRTLS radio and JMRC-IS. <br>  <br> (f)	The vendor will be required to provide Logistics Product Data for the solution provided and to update existing technical documentation or prepare new documentation as appropriate. <br>  <br> (g)	The vendor will prepare New Equipment Training (NET) documentation for delivery to the Government and will conduct NET at the JMRC.  <br>  <br> (h)	The vendor will host one-day Program Management Reviews (PMRs) roughly about every two months to discuss status of program, issues, cost, schedule, and performance factors: Technical Interface Meetings (TIMs) in conjunction with PMRs to discuss technical requirements and issues and Test Readiness Reviews (TRRs) before any testing is executed.  All of these meetings are normally held at the location where the work is being accomplished. <br> 		 <br> (i)	All software and hardware developed and/or modified under this effort shall become the property of the Government with unlimited rights.  The vendor shall upload the software and hardware specifications to the Live Training Transformation (LT2) Portal. <br>  <br> Software shall be a reuse component under LT2, using the definitions (LT2-2006-0001), LT2 Reuse Plan (CTIA-TS-0003), and LT2 Component Agreement Template. When developing software, the vendor shall also adhere to the LT2 Operational Procedures Guide. In doing so, the vendor's development process shall incorporate features that promote development of open source software products, ease of operation, ease of software maintenance, and ease of future updates and modifications.  <br>  <br> The LT2 documents can be viewed on the LT2 Portal under the References tab and then clicking on the LT2 Document Library.  The web address to login is https://www.lt2portal.org/.  Industry can view LT2 documents by establishing an account within the LT2 Portal to view the documentation.  If you do not have an account, view the following web address to register: https://www.lt2portal.org/Support/ManageMyAccount.aspx  <br>  <br> (j)	The vendor shall comply with all German Labor Laws, including the requirements in Army Europe Regulation (AER) 715-9, Contractor Personnel in Germany-Technical Expert, Troop Care, and Analytical Support Personnel.  Section V, paragraph 23a states: <br>  <br>  quote mark a. An arrangement has been made with the German Federal Ministry of Labor to allow certain DOD contractor employees to enter Germany with a minimum of bureaucratic delay to work in a temporary duty (TDY) status. These employees may remain for up to 90 days in a calendar year starting with their first day of entry into Germany. The process is referred to as a Request for Confirmation of Exemption from the Requirement to Obtain a Work Permit and is commonly called the  quote mark fax-back quote mark  process. Application under the fax-back process is mandatory for contractor employees performing work in Germany in a TDY status. quote mark  <br>  <br> (k)	The vendor shall also comply with DoD, Service, and Installation-specific access regulatory doctrine or directives at the fielding site. If required by the Installation, the vendor shall also arrange for their personnel to obtain the required post access and necessary local badges. This process normally requires the vendor personnel to provide at least two weeks in advance a copy of the approved faxback, a copy of the picture page of the passport, and other pertinent vendor information such as company name, address, etc.  The Government will use these documents and information to process the vendor personnel for placement on the installation access roster. Vendor personnel shall process the required security level clearance through the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) prior to assignment to a specific task and fielding site in order to effectively perform assigned work. <br>  <br> All vendor employees, to include subcontractor employees, requiring access to Army installations, facilities and controlled access areas shall complete AT Level I awareness training and SERE training within 90 calendar days after contract award. AT Level I awareness training is available at the following website: https://atlevel1.dtic.mil/at.  SERE Training is available through Army Knowledge Online (AKO). <br>  <br> ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government anticipates that the program requirement will be fulfilled via North Atlantic Treaty Organization Consultation, Command, and Control Agency (NATO C3A) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) 11498 in accordance with FAR Part 16.505.  The Government anticipates a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Order.  The period of performance will be for no more than nine months after award.  <br>  <br> ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $4.2M <br>  <br> RESPONSES:  Responses shall include a capabilities statement (limited up to 10 pages including the cover sheet) that includes company information to include: name, address and URL, whether the company is a manufacturer or distributor, business size and a description of the product detailing how the offered product meets the above requirements.

<DESC><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background/Objectives<br /></span>The Department of Defense (DoD) Health Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program is conducting market research in accordance with FAR Parts 10 to assess the current state and capabilities of electronic health record (EHR) products. DoD is contemplating an effort to replace its legacy EHR systems (i.e., Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA), Composite Health Care System (CHCS), Essentris, and the EHR component of the Theater Medical Information Program (TMIP)) with an "off-the-shelf" enterprise Electronic Health Record System (EHRS). Additional announcements may be posted to accommodate further market research activities. <br />For this specific announcement, DoD is interested in the current state and capabilities of an enterprise EHRS which are available "off-the-shelf" including VistA solutions. Enterprise EHRS are those product(s) or system(s) which provide a patient-centric, point-of-care system for use by clinicians and clinical staff throughout a patient's lifetime healthcare experience. DoD is interested in learning about product(s) that address all patient needs and include EHRS management, patient care plan, decision support, order management, medication, workflow, and documentation management which are positioned to support clinicians in all care environments to include outpatient, inpatient, emergency, intensive, specialty (e.g. OB/GYN, pediatrics, surgical and medicine specialties and subspecialties) and disconnected or remote care. <br /><br />The DoD is also interested in whether an EHRS product has been recognized or rated by third-party commercial research firms such as KLAS or Gartner, whether the product has attained certification and are listed on the Office of the National Coordinator Certified Health IT Product List, if the product has attained at least Stage 1 of Meaningful Use, possesses substantial commercial market share, or has been recognized by third party user surveys as relatively easy to learn, adopt, use and maintain. Interested vendors will be invited to provide an overview and demonstration to the Government of their EHRS product(s) which have been successfully deployed to large-scale, geographically-distributed medical systems and facilities. The purpose of this event is to gather information regarding commercial EHRS capabilities; the information may be utilized in the development of future DoD requirement(s) and/or solicitation(s). <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions for Interested Parties<br /></span>The Government plans to host demonstrations during the week of 21 October 2013 in the Greater Metropolitan Washington D.C. area. A completed application is required to be considered for vendor participation. There is no application fee; however, all costs incurred in responding to this announcement will be solely the responsibility of each individual vendor. Facilities with projection capability will be used; all other materials to include computers, software, and wireless internet must be provided by each individual vendor. Vendors interested in participating should provide a completed application form in accordance with the guidelines outlined to Jake Lewis at Jake.Lewis@tma.osd.mil no later than 5pm Eastern Standard time on 9 October 2013. Any questions to be addressed must be submitted prior to closing of application. They must be submitted to Jake. Lewis@tma.osd.mil. Vendors who do not participate in this Demonstration will not be excluded from any resulting solicitation. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Demonstration <br /></span><br />Upon receipt of the vendor application package, qualified applicants will receive an invitation to participate with detailed instructions. Vendors are requested to provide an overview briefing and product demonstration which addresses the topics above for a primary audience that includes end users and representatives from the requirements community. All proprietary information must be clearly marked IAW FAR Part 15. A summary of the session structure is provided in the attachment and subject to change based on Government discretion. <br />
<p>Demonstrations will be conducted in a one-on-one environment to ensure protection of any proprietary information. A Contracting Officer and Legal Counsel will be present during all demonstrations to ensure procurement integrity and equal treatment of all parties in accordance with the Competition in Contracting Act (10 U.S.C. &sect; 2304). Information or term and conditions for any future contracting vehicle(s) will not be discussed. <br /><br />This announcement is not a solicitation and issued solely for market research and planning purposes. It does not constitute a RFP or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This invitation does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Participation is not mandatory, required or a prerequisite for any future procurement activities. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. You are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred or associated with this invitation. All costs associated with this invitation will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>

<CONTACT>Rashurn Harrison, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014471136, Email rashurn.harrison@fema.dhs.gov
<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to award a non-competitive contract to Sesame Workshop, located at One Lincoln Plaza, New York, NY 10023.
<p>The United States Fire Administration (USFA), in coordination with fire service organizations, has maintained a continuous program of support to develop and distribute fire safety educational resources for caregivers and teachers of the at-risk population of children.</p>
<p>The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Sesame Workshop, a non-profit organization, holds a unique place as a leader and innovator in early education. The iconic Sesame Street characters engage both children and adults, and serve as communicators and positive role models. These trusted characters have the capacity to communicate effectively with both children and adults and to inspire parents' confidence in exploring educational content with their child. Sesame Street's content intentionally models effective interactions between adults and children, depicting concrete examples of how adults can encourage children's learning. For over four decades, Sesame Workshop has continued to find new ways to teach critical knowledge and skills to the youngest learners-particularly those from our most vulnerable families-using innovative, engaging educational content delivered through a variety of platforms. Their mission is to maximize the educational power of media assets to help all children reach their highest potential.</p>
<p>Sesame Workshop reaches millions of children in more than 150 countries. Using the latest developmental research, culturally relevant content and decades of proven experience, they help children learn, grow and contribute to their communities by creating and distributing life lessons through a wide variety of media platforms.</p>
<p>The purpose of the contract is to procure services to update the Sesame Street Fire Safety Station Kit Curriculum originally developed by Sesame Workshop and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's United States Fire Administration under contract number EMW-95-C-4702. The Sesame Street Fire Safety Station project began in 1979 and has been well-recognized for its effectiveness in reaching and teaching preschoolers. These bi-lingual fire safety education materials crafted with the Sesame Street signature language, characters, and style form the core of a preschool fire safety educational program. The teaching booklet, coloring book, poster, and CD that comprise the Kit are designed to be effective in one-time teaching situations or on an ongoing basis. <br />The contractor must be able to meet the following core capabilities required for this requirement. The contractor must have:</p>
<p>&bull; Copyright/proprietary authority for the use of the iconic Sesame Street characters (illustrative and voice talent); and,<br />&bull; Expert knowledge of key educational messaging using the proper Sesame Street voice, Sesame Street caricature artwork, layout and design</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Existing mechanisms/protocols to deliver Sesame Street crafted fire safety messages, information, and materials to preschool aged children <br />&bull; Experience in assessing learning needs of high-risk populations and in developing materials to target them</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has determined that Sesame Workshop is uniquely qualified to perform this work due to their ability to meet all the requirements listed above and their unique capability to provide Sesame Street branded educational messaging.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is NOT a request for quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes/proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement. However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same services. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) demonstrating their ability to provide these services via email to Rashurn.Harrison@fema.dhs.gov. . Statements are due not later than 1:00 P.M. EST on 10 July 2013. No phone calls accepted.</p>

The NGA Center is the nation's only dedicated organization for governors and their key policy staff to develop and implement innovative solutions to challenges of developing sound and coordinated homeland security policy. As a result of the above capabilities, the NGA Center currently has all the pre-existing relationships/associations unique to this effort already in place.</p>
<p>The NGA Center formed the GHSAC to provide an organizational structure through which the homeland security advisors from each state, territory, and the District of Columbia can discuss homeland security issues, share information and expertise, and keep governors informed about issues affecting homeland security policies in the states. For the continuation of this support, FEMA OCPO intends to award a contract to the NGA Center having a (1) year performance period. The proposed contract is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER and is not a request for competitive proposals. The Department of Commerce/NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service has a requirement for a Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) and accessories, as well as 1 roll of 70 division silk (to be used in the CPR) and intends to negotiate with and issue a sole source, firm-fixed price award to The Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science of The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth, England PL1 2PB. The award will be made using other than full and open competition procedures pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(A), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, and Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(2).
<p>The Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation for Ocean Sciences has been providing CPR bodies and silks to the NEFSC Continuous Plankton Recorder survey since the 1960's. The consistency of bodies, internal mechanisms and silks is critical to the data quality of the CPR program; this data is used widely both within and outside NOAA to understand long-term changes in the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Ecosystem.</p>
<p>The requirement of this purchase order is for a new Continuous Plankton Recorder, Internal mechanism, and division silks for the Ship of Opportunity Program.</p>
<p>The CPR bodies, internal mechanisms, and silks provided by the Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation for Ocean Sciences are the same that are used by the global Continuous Plankton Recorder program, thus the data collected in the Northeast U.S. continental shelf is comparable to that collected globally. This comparability must be maintained. The need for consistency and comparability is only met by ordering the CPR, internal mechanism and silks from the same vendor. These are unique products designed and sold exclusively by the Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation, and no other vendors of similar products have been identified.</p>
<p>The associated North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement or submitting a capabilities statement containing sufficient detail to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements.</p>

<DESC><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%;">USAID/Colombia intends to award a sole source contract modification to Chemonics International, Inc. under contract No. AID-514-C-12-00003. The estimated amount of this modification is USD$4,200,000 and it will extend the contract completion date by six months. The above contract was awarded to Chemonics International, Inc. on a full and open competition basis on March 13, 2012, and the estimated completion date is September 15, 2015. The current total estimated contract amount is USD$21,497,357. The purpose of the above contract is to provide technical assistance to strengthen respect for and protection of human rights in Colombia. The purpose of this modification is to continue to provide specialized technical assistance services and support to both the Government of Colombia (GOC) and civil society to promote human rights, prevent human rights violations, and provide effective and meaningful response to human violations after they have occurred. The new work planned with the additional resources from this modification will allow USAID/Colombia to increase support and fulfill new requests from GOC counterparts, expand technical assistance and grants funding for civil society and key NGO counterparts, and respond to changing opportunities in a fluid and dynamic human rights context. The proposed extension will provide HRP III the opportunity to ensure that new mayors and governors are made aware of human rights commitments by their predecessors, and that human rights continues to be prioritized with clear activities included in their new municipal and departmental development plans and budgets.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%;">Those plans and budgets will guide and fund municipal and departmental-level efforts to protect human rights over the following four-year period (2016-2020). USAID intends to negotiate this modification with only one source under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70 (b)(5), where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays. The required services include continuation and expansion of services of the same nature as described in the original statement of work of the original contract. This notice is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government&rsquo;s requirement. Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government.</span></div>

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, MD intends to issue a sole source award utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Life Technologies Corporation for a Life Technologies EVOS FL Auto with accessories. <br>  <br>      The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) has a requirement for a Life Technologies EVOS FL Auto with accessories. Life Technologies is the sole manufacturer of a fully automated microscopy system that can image in color and fluorescent mode and accommodate a wide variety of plastic and glass growing vessels such as Petri dishes, slides, and 6 to 96 well plates.  Imaging time is greatly reduced as the image sample is directly focused on and viewed on screen, eliminating the need to first focus by looking into the eyepiece and then refocusing the image on screen.  In addition, the software and image acquisition function is easy to use and good quality images can be captured almost immediately by novice microscopists.  All functions are automated so that imaging on a 96 well plates, for example, can be set up and performed without the presence of personnel. Finally, the system is configured with an LED light source that has a lifetime of 50,000 hrs and built into the filter cubes, allowing for less bulb changes and alignment issues typically seen in other microscope systems. <br>  <br>      This notice of intent is for information purposes only, therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. All sources eligible to provide this service must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide services outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. If no responses are received, within 15 days, 16 October 2013, after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable supplies and services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. Response to this award is to be sent to roman.e.laterza.civ@mail.mil . <br>  <br>

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1.Technical Acceptability. 2. Price. The Government will evaluate the total price of the offer for the award purposes.</p>
<p>(1) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have "Technical Acceptability" assessment, award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have "Technical Acceptability," the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have "Technical Acceptability." An award, pending availability of funds, will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable, responsible offeror who responds to all items included in the solicitation (all or none) and complies with the terms of the Request for Proposal (RFP).<br />(2) These are the technical areas that we will evaluate to determine the technical acceptability:<br />a. Company's three year history of similar projects, including whether any Notices of Violation were received. Receipt of any Notice of Violations will not alone disqualify quotes.<br />b. Reasonableness of proposed schedule. The Air Force estimates a period of performance of 154 days from Notice to Proceed.<br />(3) The offers will be evaluated by key government personnel, rating the aforementioned technical areas on a pass or fail basis. Any offer receiving a "fail" rating on any of the technical areas will be ineligible and not considered for contract award.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are EQUAL. However, quotes which are not rated as Technically Acceptable will be eliminated from the competition and receive no further consideration.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Thoracic Catheters. Vendors who qualified for the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MS-1204-40_Thoracic_Catheters are eligible for participation. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong></p>
<p>These Thoracic Catheter products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This RFIAQ is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MS-1204-40_Thoracic_Catheters. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from DAPA prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<strong> Anticipated selection date is November 2013. Among vendors who are on the QSL MS-1204-40_Thoracic_Catheters, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Thoracic Catheters.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Thoracic Catheters. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $138,706.89 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the QSL MS-1204-40_Thoracic_Catheters who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this RFIAQ via e-mail to the POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO South via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>Vendor must complete and submit the FBO Package Worksheet</strong>. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO South POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MHS. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br />Thoracic Catheter pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full by the response date of this RFIAQ. <strong>Vendors not currently on the QSL for Thoracic Catheters will not be considered for an IA.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed/renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy Installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract.

<p>Addendum to 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Jul 2013) is tailored in accordance with FAR 12.302:</p>
<p>(a) Inspection/Acceptance: "Government inspection" shall mean inspection by the Seller's representative qualified to perform such inspection in accordance with Seller's customary commercial practice. "Acceptance" will be based on submission of 1) a Seller certificate of conformance, and 2) Seller's issuance of a Memo of Shipment document. The Government's post acceptance rights are defined in FAR 52.246-2 (AUG 1996), paragraphs (k) and (l). These paragraphs are hereby added to the end of FAR 52.212-4(a) as shown below. "(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract." "(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or (2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in paragraph (l)(1) or (l)(2) of this clause and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby."</p>
<p>(h) Patent Indemnity: is hereby replaced in its entirety with the following text: <br />A. If the Government receives a claim that any Product or part thereof manufactured by the Contractor, without further combination, infringes a United States patent, the Government shall notify the Contractor promptly in writing and give the Contractor all available information to evaluate such claim and, at the Government's discretion, the Contractor may be permitted to assist the Government in its defense and/or seek an equitable settlement with the patent infringement claimant. The Contractor shall then at its own expense and option (i) pay the reasonable and entire compensation pursuant to 28 USC &sect;1498, or (ii) procure for the Government the right to use such Product, or (iii) replace or modify the Product to avoid infringement, or (iv) assist the Government in defending against such claims in the US Court of Federal Claims. If the US Court of Federal Claims holds such Product to constitute infringement, the Contractor shall take at its option one or more of the actions under (i), (ii), or (iii) above. With respect to any Product not manufactured by the Contractor, the patent indemnity, if any, given by the manufacturer thereof shall apply.<br />B. The rights and obligations of the parties with respect to patents are solely and exclusively as stated herein. C. This Patent Indemnity clause shall not apply to claims related to the contractor's performance at the Government's direction, such as the contractor's implementation of DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation. The Government's configuration control of items to be delivered under this contract, standing alone, shall not be interpreted to mean "performance at the Government's direction."<br />D. The patent obligations recited above are in lieu of all other patent obligations whatsoever, whether oral, written, express or implied.</p>
<p>(j) Risk of Loss: The contract shall state FOB Origin.</p>
<p>(l) Termination for the Government's Convenience: The Government reserves the right to terminate the contract, or any part hereof, for its' sole convenience provided the end user customer (or Government's customer's) contract is terminated.</p>
<p>(m) Termination for Cause: In the event of the Government decides to terminate under this paragraph, the Contractor shall be paid the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. Additionally, the Government shall: (1) provide written notice of default to the Contractor, (2) identify in the notice the bases for the Government's termination decision, and (3) provide the Contractor with an opportunity to cure such failure within (15) days after receipt of the Contracting Officer's written notice.</p>
<p>(n) Title: "Acceptance" will be based on the submission of 1) a Seller certificate of conformance, and 2) Seller's issuance of a Memo of Shipment document. The Government's post acceptance rights are defined in FAR 52.246-2 (AUG 1996), paragraphs (k) and (l) and are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

This warranty does not cover normal wear and tear and shall be void if the Goods have not been used, handled, stored, maintained, installed or operated in accordance with sound aviation practice including any instructions issued by Dowty.<br />The Government is requested to return to Dowty any item found to be defective under warranty. Dowty shall without charge, at its option, either repair or replace any item found to its satisfaction to be defective and under this warranty.</p>
<p>(p) Limitation of Liability: The liability of Dowty to the Government arising out of or connected with or resulting from the manufacture sale, possession, use or handling of any Goods whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise shall not in any event exceed the purchase price of the Goods giving rise to the Government's claim. The foregoing shall constitute the sole remedy of the Government and the sole liability of Dowty. In no event shall supplier be liable for indirect, incidental or consequential losses or damages. The warranties of merchantability and expressed or implied, are disclaimed. In such cases, the contracting officer shall ensure that the express warranty provides for repair or replacement of defective items discovered with a reasonable period of time after acceptance.</p>

<p>252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal <br />Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to <br />ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br /><br />(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>

<p><strong>Addendum to 52.212-2 - EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br /><br /></strong>(a) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(<strong>1) PRICE<br />(2) TECHNICAL<br />(3) PAST PERFORMANCE</strong></p>
<p>Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price when being evaluated.<br />(b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(d). This acquisition will utilize a best value approach, in which the Government seeks to award to an offeror who provides the greatest confidence that they will meet the Government's requirements affordably. The Best Value technique chosen for this particular acquisition will be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT).<br />(e). The PPT approach permits tradeoffs between price/cost and past performance, and will include an evaluation for technical acceptability. All proposals shall first be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the first five (5) of the lowest priced proposals shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. In the event that the first five (5) evaluated proposals do not yield an offer with an acceptable technical rating, the evaluation process will continue one offer at a time, until a technically acceptable proposal is identified. Contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements, is considered technically acceptable, and will provide the best value to the Government, considering price and past performance. For this acquisition, technical and past performance, when combined, significantly more important than price/cost.<br />(f). Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical acceptability or price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. Discussions or negotiation may be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the 1st Special Operations Contracting Squadron, 350 Tully Street, Hurlburt Field, FL.<br />(g). Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers.<br />(h). Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.<br />(i). To assure timely and equitable evaluation of the proposal, the offeror must follow the instructions contained herein. Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The response shall consist of three (3) separate parts; Part I - Price Proposal, Part II - Technical Proposal, and Part III - Past Performance Information.<br />(j) The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price.<br />(k). Price/Cost Evaluation. Initially proposals shall be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the lowest priced proposal shall be evaluated, including any option prices (if applicable). Each offerors' price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness. Unrealistically low proposed costs/prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that either the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal. <br />(l). Technical Evaluation. Offers shall be evaluated independently of the cost/price proposal evaluation to determine the offerors compliance with the technical requirements of this solicitation. The government may make a final determination as to the rating of an offer based on the proposal as submitted without requesting any further information. <br />Technical proposals will be evaluated against the following factors:<br />(a). Project Schedule - as outlined in section C of 52.212-1 paragraph 2.(a)(i).<br />(b). Equipment Submittal - Documentation in the form of the manufacturer's literature or other fully descriptive literature detailing the type/model number low gravity equipment to be used to clear and cut the wetlands on this project. The specifications must include the required &le;2 PSI per sq ft specifications of the equipment. <br />(b). Evaluators shall assign a rating, which falls within one of the following ranges according to the degree to which the offeror meets the minimum requirements described above:<br />(i). ACCEPTABLE - Meets evaluation criteria and minimum requirements. Proposal is acceptable.<br />(ii). UNACCEPTABLE - Fails to meet minimum requirements. Deficiencies are significant and require major revisions to the proposal to make it acceptable. If determined to be unacceptable, this will render the entire proposal as technically unacceptable and eliminate the offeror from further consideration.<br />(c). If all offerors are deemed unacceptable, the government may establish a competitive range and enter into discussions.<br />(m). Past Performance Evaluation: Using data provided by the offeror, the contracting officer shall seek performance information for only those offerors rated technically acceptable.</p>
<p>(1). Each proposal shall provide current and RELEVANT information regarding an offerors actions under previously awarded contracts. Offerors shall identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, local government, and private) for efforts similar to the Government requirement as stated in this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the offerors previous performance in the following areas: Adherence to progress schedules; provide management, technical, and administrative experience; effective quality control; timely submission of submittal data; approach to problem solving; timely resolution of punch list items; and ability to meet contract performance schedule. The Government may evaluate information on problems identified and encountered on previous contracts and corrective actions taken by the offeror. In the case of an offeror without a record of RELEVANT past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>(2). Performance Confidence will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2). Performance confidence ratings assess the probability of the offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offerors past performance. In assessing past performance confidence, the evaluators will primarily rely on information provided by offerors &lsquo;completed past performance questionnaires. However, the Government may use data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources to be used in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>(3). The Government will evaluate the offerors ability to successfully complete projects based on demonstrated past and present experience under RECENT and RELEVANT contracts. <br />(a). Recency is defined as projects performed in the last three (3) years. <br />(b). Relevancy is defined as contracts involving cutting and clearing wetlands of similar size to that of this project.<br />(c). The following relevancy definitions, apply:<br />(i). VERY RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(ii). RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(iii). SOMEWHAT RELEVANT: Past/present performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities that this solicitation requires.<br />(iv). NOT RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(4). The process will result in an overall performance rating as defined below. This performance assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offerors demonstrated past and present performance. The ratings are defined as follows:<br />Rating and Description:<br />(i). SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(ii). SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(iii). LIMITED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(iv).NO CONFIDENCE Based on the offerors performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br />(v).UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable or the offerors performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br />(5). If the lowest priced evaluated offer has been determined technically acceptable and is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.<br />(6). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.<br />Additionally, the offeror shall submit <br />5. Documentation in the form of the manufacturer's literature or other fully descriptive literature detailing the type/model number low gravity equipment to be used to clear and cut the wetlands on this project. The specifications must include the required &le;2 PSI per sq ft specifications of the equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum to 52.212-2 - EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br /><br /></strong>(a) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(<strong>1) PRICE<br />(2) TECHNICAL<br />(3) PAST PERFORMANCE</strong></p>
<p>Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price when being evaluated.<br />(b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(d). This acquisition will utilize a best value approach, in which the Government seeks to award to an offeror who provides the greatest confidence that they will meet the Government's requirements affordably. The Best Value technique chosen for this particular acquisition will be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT).<br />(e). The PPT approach permits tradeoffs between price/cost and past performance, and will include an evaluation for technical acceptability. All proposals shall first be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the first five (5) of the lowest priced proposals shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. In the event that the first five (5) evaluated proposals do not yield an offer with an acceptable technical rating, the evaluation process will continue one offer at a time, until a technically acceptable proposal is identified. Contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements, is considered technically acceptable, and will provide the best value to the Government, considering price and past performance. For this acquisition, technical and past performance, when combined, significantly more important than price/cost.<br />(f). Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical acceptability or price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. Discussions or negotiation may be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the 1st Special Operations Contracting Squadron, 350 Tully Street, Hurlburt Field, FL.<br />(g). Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers.<br />(h). Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.<br />(i). To assure timely and equitable evaluation of the proposal, the offeror must follow the instructions contained herein. Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The response shall consist of three (3) separate parts; Part I - Price Proposal, Part II - Technical Proposal, and Part III - Past Performance Information.<br />(j) The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price.<br />(k). Price/Cost Evaluation. Initially proposals shall be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the lowest priced proposal shall be evaluated, including any option prices (if applicable). Each offerors' price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness. Unrealistically low proposed costs/prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that either the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal. <br />(l). Technical Evaluation. Offers shall be evaluated independently of the cost/price proposal evaluation to determine the offerors compliance with the technical requirements of this solicitation. The government may make a final determination as to the rating of an offer based on the proposal as submitted without requesting any further information. <br />Technical proposals will be evaluated against the following factors:<br />(a). Project Schedule - as outlined in section C of 52.212-1 paragraph 2.(a)(i).<br />(b). Equipment Submittal - Documentation in the form of the manufacturer's literature or other fully descriptive literature detailing the type/model number low gravity equipment to be used to clear and cut the wetlands on this project. The specifications must include the required &le;2 PSI per sq ft specifications of the equipment. <br />(b). Evaluators shall assign a rating, which falls within one of the following ranges according to the degree to which the offeror meets the minimum requirements described above:<br />(i). ACCEPTABLE - Meets evaluation criteria and minimum requirements. Proposal is acceptable.<br />(ii). UNACCEPTABLE - Fails to meet minimum requirements. Deficiencies are significant and require major revisions to the proposal to make it acceptable. If determined to be unacceptable, this will render the entire proposal as technically unacceptable and eliminate the offeror from further consideration.<br />(c). If all offerors are deemed unacceptable, the government may establish a competitive range and enter into discussions.<br />(m). Past Performance Evaluation: Using data provided by the offeror, the contracting officer shall seek performance information for only those offerors rated technically acceptable.</p>
<p>(1). Each proposal shall provide current and RELEVANT information regarding an offerors actions under previously awarded contracts. Offerors shall identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, local government, and private) for efforts similar to the Government requirement as stated in this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the offerors previous performance in the following areas: Adherence to progress schedules; provide management, technical, and administrative experience; effective quality control; timely submission of submittal data; approach to problem solving; timely resolution of punch list items; and ability to meet contract performance schedule. The Government may evaluate information on problems identified and encountered on previous contracts and corrective actions taken by the offeror. In the case of an offeror without a record of RELEVANT past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>(2). Performance Confidence will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2). Performance confidence ratings assess the probability of the offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offerors past performance. In assessing past performance confidence, the evaluators will primarily rely on information provided by offerors &lsquo;completed past performance questionnaires. However, the Government may use data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources to be used in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>(3). The Government will evaluate the offerors ability to successfully complete projects based on demonstrated past and present experience under RECENT and RELEVANT contracts. <br />(a). Recency is defined as projects performed in the last three (3) years. <br />(b). Relevancy is defined as contracts involving cutting and clearing wetlands of similar size to that of this project.<br />(c). The following relevancy definitions, apply:<br />(i). VERY RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(ii). RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(iii). SOMEWHAT RELEVANT: Past/present performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities that this solicitation requires.<br />(iv). NOT RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(4). The process will result in an overall performance rating as defined below. This performance assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offerors demonstrated past and present performance. The ratings are defined as follows:<br />Rating and Description:<br />(i). SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(ii). SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(iii). LIMITED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(iv).NO CONFIDENCE Based on the offerors performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br />(v).UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable or the offerors performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br />(5). If the lowest priced evaluated offer has been determined technically acceptable and is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.<br />(6). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.<br />Additionally, the offeror shall submit <br />5. Documentation in the form of the manufacturer's literature or other fully descriptive literature detailing the type/model number low gravity equipment to be used to clear and cut the wetlands on this project. The specifications must include the required &le;2 PSI per sq ft specifications of the equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum to 52.212-2 - EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br /><br /></strong>(a) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(<strong>1) PRICE<br />(2) TECHNICAL<br />(3) PAST PERFORMANCE</strong></p>
<p>Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price when being evaluated.<br />(b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(d). This acquisition will utilize a best value approach, in which the Government seeks to award to an offeror who provides the greatest confidence that they will meet the Government's requirements affordably. The Best Value technique chosen for this particular acquisition will be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT).<br />(e). The PPT approach permits tradeoffs between price/cost and past performance, and will include an evaluation for technical acceptability. All proposals shall first be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the first five (5) of the lowest priced proposals shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. In the event that the first five (5) evaluated proposals do not yield an offer with an acceptable technical rating, the evaluation process will continue one offer at a time, until a technically acceptable proposal is identified. Contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements, is considered technically acceptable, and will provide the best value to the Government, considering price and past performance. For this acquisition, technical and past performance, when combined, significantly more important than price/cost.<br />(f). Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical acceptability or price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. Discussions or negotiation may be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the 1st Special Operations Contracting Squadron, 350 Tully Street, Hurlburt Field, FL.<br />(g). Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers.<br />(h). Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.<br />(i). To assure timely and equitable evaluation of the proposal, the offeror must follow the instructions contained herein. Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The response shall consist of three (3) separate parts; Part I - Price Proposal, Part II - Technical Proposal, and Part III - Past Performance Information.<br />(j) The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price.<br />(k). Price/Cost Evaluation. Initially proposals shall be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the lowest priced proposal shall be evaluated, including any option prices (if applicable). Each offerors' price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness. Unrealistically low proposed costs/prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that either the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal. <br />(l). Technical Evaluation. Offers shall be evaluated independently of the cost/price proposal evaluation to determine the offerors compliance with the technical requirements of this solicitation. The government may make a final determination as to the rating of an offer based on the proposal as submitted without requesting any further information. <br />Technical proposals will be evaluated against the following factors:<br />(a). Project Schedule - as outlined in section C of 52.212-1 paragraph 2.(a)(i).<br />(b). Equipment Submittal - Documentation in the form of the manufacturer's literature or other fully descriptive literature detailing the type/model number low gravity equipment to be used to clear and cut the wetlands on this project. The specifications must include the required &le;2 PSI per sq ft specifications of the equipment. <br />(b). Evaluators shall assign a rating, which falls within one of the following ranges according to the degree to which the offeror meets the minimum requirements described above:<br />(i). ACCEPTABLE - Meets evaluation criteria and minimum requirements. Proposal is acceptable.<br />(ii). UNACCEPTABLE - Fails to meet minimum requirements. Deficiencies are significant and require major revisions to the proposal to make it acceptable. If determined to be unacceptable, this will render the entire proposal as technically unacceptable and eliminate the offeror from further consideration.<br />(c). If all offerors are deemed unacceptable, the government may establish a competitive range and enter into discussions.<br />(m). Past Performance Evaluation: Using data provided by the offeror, the contracting officer shall seek performance information for only those offerors rated technically acceptable.</p>
<p>(1). Each proposal shall provide current and RELEVANT information regarding an offerors actions under previously awarded contracts. Offerors shall identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, local government, and private) for efforts similar to the Government requirement as stated in this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the offerors previous performance in the following areas: Adherence to progress schedules; provide management, technical, and administrative experience; effective quality control; timely submission of submittal data; approach to problem solving; timely resolution of punch list items; and ability to meet contract performance schedule. The Government may evaluate information on problems identified and encountered on previous contracts and corrective actions taken by the offeror. In the case of an offeror without a record of RELEVANT past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>(2). Performance Confidence will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2). Performance confidence ratings assess the probability of the offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offerors past performance. In assessing past performance confidence, the evaluators will primarily rely on information provided by offerors &lsquo;completed past performance questionnaires. However, the Government may use data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources to be used in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>(3). The Government will evaluate the offerors ability to successfully complete projects based on demonstrated past and present experience under RECENT and RELEVANT contracts. <br />(a). Recency is defined as projects performed in the last three (3) years. <br />(b). Relevancy is defined as contracts involving cutting and clearing wetlands of similar size to that of this project.<br />(c). The following relevancy definitions, apply:<br />(i). VERY RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(ii). RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(iii). SOMEWHAT RELEVANT: Past/present performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities that this solicitation requires.<br />(iv). NOT RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(4). The process will result in an overall performance rating as defined below. This performance assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offerors demonstrated past and present performance. The ratings are defined as follows:<br />Rating and Description:<br />(i). SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(ii). SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(iii). LIMITED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(iv).NO CONFIDENCE Based on the offerors performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br />(v).UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable or the offerors performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br />(5). If the lowest priced evaluated offer has been determined technically acceptable and is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.<br />(6). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.<br />Additionally, the offeror shall submit <br />5. Documentation in the form of the manufacturer's literature or other fully descriptive literature detailing the type/model number low gravity equipment to be used to clear and cut the wetlands on this project. The specifications must include the required &le;2 PSI per sq ft specifications of the equipment.</p>

<p>&emsp;<br /><strong>Addendum to 52.212-2 - EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br /></strong>(a) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br /><strong>(1) PRICE<br />(2) TECHNICAL<br />(3) PAST PERFORMANCE</strong></p>
<p>Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price when being evaluated.<br />(b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(d). This acquisition will utilize a best value approach, in which the Government seeks to award to an offeror who provides the greatest confidence that they will meet the Government's requirements affordably. The Best Value technique chosen for this particular acquisition will be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT).<br />(e). The PPT approach permits tradeoffs between price/cost and past performance, and will include an evaluation for technical acceptability. All proposals shall first be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the first of the lowest priced proposals shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. In the event that the first evaluated proposal does not yield an offer with an acceptable technical rating, the evaluation process will continue one offer at a time, until a technically acceptable proposal is identified. Contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements, is considered technically acceptable, and will provide the best value to the Government, considering price and past performance. For this acquisition, technical and past performance, when combined, significantly more important than price/cost.<br />(f). Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical acceptability or price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. Discussions or negotiation may be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the 1st Special Operations Contracting Squadron, 350 Tully Street, Hurlburt Field, FL.<br />(g). Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers.<br />(h). Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.<br />(i). To assure timely and equitable evaluation of the proposal, the offeror must follow the instructions contained herein. Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The response shall consist of three (3) separate parts; Part I - Price Proposal, Part II - Technical Proposal, and Part III - Past Performance Information.<br />(j) The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price.<br />(k). Price/Cost Evaluation. Initially proposals shall be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the lowest priced proposal shall be evaluated, including any option prices (if applicable). Each offerors' price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness. Unrealistically low proposed costs/prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that either the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal. <br />(l). Technical Evaluation. Offers shall be evaluated independently of the cost/price proposal evaluation to determine the offerors compliance with the technical requirements of this solicitation. The government may make a final determination as to the rating of an offer based on the proposal as submitted without requesting any further information. <br />Technical proposals will be evaluated against the following factors:<br />(a). Project Schedule - as outlined in section C of 52.212-1 paragraph 2.(a)(i).<br />(b). Equipment Submittal as outlined in section C of 52.212-1 paragraph 2.(b) - Documentation in the form of the manufacturer's literature or other fully descriptive literature detailing the type/model number documentation describing specific type/model asphalt cutting/demolishing equipment to be used to cut and clear the asphalt on this project. Specifications must include the capability of cutting/clearing the 12" deep asphalt to be used to. <br />(b). Evaluators shall assign a rating, which falls within one of the following ranges according to the degree to which the offeror meets the minimum requirements described above:<br />(i). ACCEPTABLE - Meets evaluation criteria and minimum requirements. Proposal is acceptable.<br />(ii). UNACCEPTABLE - Fails to meet minimum requirements. Deficiencies are significant and require major revisions to the proposal to make it acceptable. If determined to be unacceptable, this will render the entire proposal as technically unacceptable and eliminate the offeror from further consideration.<br />(c). If all offerors are deemed unacceptable, the government may establish a competitive range and enter into discussions.<br />(m). Past Performance Evaluation: Using data provided by the offeror, the contracting officer shall seek performance information for only those offerors rated technically acceptable.</p>
<p>(1). Each proposal shall provide current and RELEVANT information regarding an offerors actions under previously awarded contracts. Offerors shall identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, local government, and private) for efforts similar to the Government requirement as stated in this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the offerors previous performance in the following areas: Adherence to progress schedules; provide management, technical, and administrative experience; effective quality control; timely submission of submittal data; approach to problem solving; timely resolution of punch list items; and ability to meet contract performance schedule. The Government may evaluate information on problems identified and encountered on previous contracts and corrective actions taken by the offeror. In the case of an offeror without a record of RELEVANT past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>(2). Performance Confidence will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2). Performance confidence ratings assess the probability of the offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offerors past performance. In assessing past performance confidence, the evaluators will primarily rely on information provided by offerors provided Past Performance information and of that provided to the Govt by the past performance POCs. However, the Government may use data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources to be used in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>(3). The Government will evaluate the offerors ability to successfully complete projects based on demonstrated past and present experience under RECENT and RELEVANT contracts. <br />(a). Recency is defined as projects performed in the last three (3) years. <br />(b). Relevancy is defined as contracts involving cutting and clearing asphalt of similar size and depth to that of this project.<br />(c). The following relevancy definitions, apply:<br />(i). VERY RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(ii). RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(iii). SOMEWHAT RELEVANT: Past/present performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities that this solicitation requires.<br />(iv). NOT RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(4). The process will result in an overall performance rating as defined below. This performance assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offerors demonstrated past and present performance. The ratings are defined as follows:<br />Rating and Description:<br />(i). SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(ii). SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(iii). LIMITED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(iv).NO CONFIDENCE Based on the offerors performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br />(v).UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable or the offerors performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br />(5). If the lowest priced evaluated offer has been determined technically acceptable and is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.<br />(6). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) Technical capability (ii) Price. Technical capability is approximately equal to price. <br />The Government will award a FFP contract to the technically-acceptable and responsible offeror with the lowest priced offer. <br />Technical acceptability will be determined by the following:</p>
<p>Offerors shall submit past performance documentation showing experience demolishing and clearing asphalt. The offeror shall include their CAGE and DUNS with their offer. To be considered technically acceptable, the contractor shall provide documentation on two or more (not more than five) past or current projects of similar size and complexity (within 25% the size of this project, or larger). This document may be in the form of a listing of prior contracts (commercial or Government) and state at a minimum the following information:<br />1. The contract number &amp; customer POC name and number<br />2. The approximate area of asphalt demolished and cleared<br />3. The contract dollar amount<br />4. Specific type/model number information for the asphalt cutting/demolishing equipment used on the contract<br />Additionally, the offeror shall submit:<br />5. Documentation in the form of the manufacturer's literature or other fully descriptive literature detailing the type/model number of the asphalt cutting/demolishing equipment to be used to cut and clear the asphalt on this project. The specifications must include the required 12" deep asphalt cutting capability of the equipment.</p>

<p>&emsp;<br /><strong>Addendum to 52.212-2 - EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br /></strong>(a) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br /><strong>(1) PRICE<br />(2) TECHNICAL<br />(3) PAST PERFORMANCE</strong></p>
<p>Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price when being evaluated.<br />(b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(d). This acquisition will utilize a best value approach, in which the Government seeks to award to an offeror who provides the greatest confidence that they will meet the Government's requirements affordably. The Best Value technique chosen for this particular acquisition will be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT).<br />(e). The PPT approach permits tradeoffs between price/cost and past performance, and will include an evaluation for technical acceptability. All proposals shall first be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the first of the lowest priced proposals shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. In the event that the first evaluated proposal does not yield an offer with an acceptable technical rating, the evaluation process will continue one offer at a time, until a technically acceptable proposal is identified. Contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements, is considered technically acceptable, and will provide the best value to the Government, considering price and past performance. For this acquisition, technical and past performance, when combined, significantly more important than price/cost.<br />(f). Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical acceptability or price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. Discussions or negotiation may be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the 1st Special Operations Contracting Squadron, 350 Tully Street, Hurlburt Field, FL.<br />(g). Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers.<br />(h). Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.<br />(i). To assure timely and equitable evaluation of the proposal, the offeror must follow the instructions contained herein. Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The response shall consist of three (3) separate parts; Part I - Price Proposal, Part II - Technical Proposal, and Part III - Past Performance Information.<br />(j) The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price.<br />(k). Price/Cost Evaluation. Initially proposals shall be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the lowest priced proposal shall be evaluated, including any option prices (if applicable). Each offerors' price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness. Unrealistically low proposed costs/prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that either the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal. <br />(l). Technical Evaluation. Offers shall be evaluated independently of the cost/price proposal evaluation to determine the offerors compliance with the technical requirements of this solicitation. The government may make a final determination as to the rating of an offer based on the proposal as submitted without requesting any further information. <br />Technical proposals will be evaluated against the following factors:<br />(a). Project Schedule - as outlined in section C of 52.212-1 paragraph 2.(a)(i).<br />(b). Equipment Submittal as outlined in section C of 52.212-1 paragraph 2.(b) - Documentation in the form of the manufacturer's literature or other fully descriptive literature detailing the type/model number documentation describing specific type/model asphalt cutting/demolishing equipment to be used to cut and clear the asphalt on this project. Specifications must include the capability of cutting/clearing the 12" deep asphalt to be used to. <br />(b). Evaluators shall assign a rating, which falls within one of the following ranges according to the degree to which the offeror meets the minimum requirements described above:<br />(i). ACCEPTABLE - Meets evaluation criteria and minimum requirements. Proposal is acceptable.<br />(ii). UNACCEPTABLE - Fails to meet minimum requirements. Deficiencies are significant and require major revisions to the proposal to make it acceptable. If determined to be unacceptable, this will render the entire proposal as technically unacceptable and eliminate the offeror from further consideration.<br />(c). If all offerors are deemed unacceptable, the government may establish a competitive range and enter into discussions.<br />(m). Past Performance Evaluation: Using data provided by the offeror, the contracting officer shall seek performance information for only those offerors rated technically acceptable.</p>
<p>(1). Each proposal shall provide current and RELEVANT information regarding an offerors actions under previously awarded contracts. Offerors shall identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, local government, and private) for efforts similar to the Government requirement as stated in this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the offerors previous performance in the following areas: Adherence to progress schedules; provide management, technical, and administrative experience; effective quality control; timely submission of submittal data; approach to problem solving; timely resolution of punch list items; and ability to meet contract performance schedule. The Government may evaluate information on problems identified and encountered on previous contracts and corrective actions taken by the offeror. In the case of an offeror without a record of RELEVANT past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>(2). Performance Confidence will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2). Performance confidence ratings assess the probability of the offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offerors past performance. In assessing past performance confidence, the evaluators will primarily rely on information provided by offerors provided Past Performance information and of that provided to the Govt by the past performance POCs. However, the Government may use data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources to be used in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>(3). The Government will evaluate the offerors ability to successfully complete projects based on demonstrated past and present experience under RECENT and RELEVANT contracts. <br />(a). Recency is defined as projects performed in the last three (3) years. <br />(b). Relevancy is defined as contracts involving cutting and clearing asphalt of similar size and depth to that of this project.<br />(c). The following relevancy definitions, apply:<br />(i). VERY RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(ii). RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(iii). SOMEWHAT RELEVANT: Past/present performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities that this solicitation requires.<br />(iv). NOT RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(4). The process will result in an overall performance rating as defined below. This performance assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offerors demonstrated past and present performance. The ratings are defined as follows:<br />Rating and Description:<br />(i). SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(ii). SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(iii). LIMITED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(iv).NO CONFIDENCE Based on the offerors performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br />(v).UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable or the offerors performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br />(5). If the lowest priced evaluated offer has been determined technically acceptable and is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.<br />(6). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>Additionally, the offeror shall submit:<br />5. Documentation in the form of the manufacturer's literature or other fully descriptive literature detailing the type/model number of the asphalt cutting/demolishing equipment to be used to cut and clear the asphalt on this project. The specifications must include the required 12" deep asphalt cutting capability of the equipment.</p>

<p>&emsp;<br /><strong>Addendum to 52.212-2 - EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br /></strong>(a) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br /><strong>(1) PRICE<br />(2) TECHNICAL<br />(3) PAST PERFORMANCE</strong></p>
<p>Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price when being evaluated.<br />(b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(d). This acquisition will utilize a best value approach, in which the Government seeks to award to an offeror who provides the greatest confidence that they will meet the Government's requirements affordably. The Best Value technique chosen for this particular acquisition will be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT).<br />(e). The PPT approach permits tradeoffs between price/cost and past performance, and will include an evaluation for technical acceptability. All proposals shall first be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the first of the lowest priced proposals shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. In the event that the first evaluated proposal does not yield an offer with an acceptable technical rating, the evaluation process will continue one offer at a time, until a technically acceptable proposal is identified. Contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements, is considered technically acceptable, and will provide the best value to the Government, considering price and past performance. For this acquisition, technical and past performance, when combined, significantly more important than price/cost.<br />(f). Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical acceptability or price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. Discussions or negotiation may be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the 1st Special Operations Contracting Squadron, 350 Tully Street, Hurlburt Field, FL.<br />(g). Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers.<br />(h). Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.<br />(i). To assure timely and equitable evaluation of the proposal, the offeror must follow the instructions contained herein. Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The response shall consist of three (3) separate parts; Part I - Price Proposal, Part II - Technical Proposal, and Part III - Past Performance Information.<br />(j) The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price.<br />(k). Price/Cost Evaluation. Initially proposals shall be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the lowest priced proposal shall be evaluated, including any option prices (if applicable). Each offerors' price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness. Unrealistically low proposed costs/prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that either the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal. <br />(l). Technical Evaluation. Offers shall be evaluated independently of the cost/price proposal evaluation to determine the offerors compliance with the technical requirements of this solicitation. The government may make a final determination as to the rating of an offer based on the proposal as submitted without requesting any further information. <br />Technical proposals will be evaluated against the following factors:<br />(a). Project Schedule - as outlined in section C of 52.212-1 paragraph 2.(a)(i).<br />(b). Equipment Submittal as outlined in section C of 52.212-1 paragraph 2.(b) - Documentation in the form of the manufacturer's literature or other fully descriptive literature detailing the type/model number documentation describing specific type/model asphalt cutting/demolishing equipment to be used to cut and clear the asphalt on this project. Specifications must include the capability of cutting/clearing the 12" deep asphalt to be used to. <br />(b). Evaluators shall assign a rating, which falls within one of the following ranges according to the degree to which the offeror meets the minimum requirements described above:<br />(i). ACCEPTABLE - Meets evaluation criteria and minimum requirements. Proposal is acceptable.<br />(ii). UNACCEPTABLE - Fails to meet minimum requirements. Deficiencies are significant and require major revisions to the proposal to make it acceptable. If determined to be unacceptable, this will render the entire proposal as technically unacceptable and eliminate the offeror from further consideration.<br />(c). If all offerors are deemed unacceptable, the government may establish a competitive range and enter into discussions.<br />(m). Past Performance Evaluation: Using data provided by the offeror, the contracting officer shall seek performance information for only those offerors rated technically acceptable.</p>
<p>(1). Each proposal shall provide current and RELEVANT information regarding an offerors actions under previously awarded contracts. Offerors shall identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, local government, and private) for efforts similar to the Government requirement as stated in this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the offerors previous performance in the following areas: Adherence to progress schedules; provide management, technical, and administrative experience; effective quality control; timely submission of submittal data; approach to problem solving; timely resolution of punch list items; and ability to meet contract performance schedule. The Government may evaluate information on problems identified and encountered on previous contracts and corrective actions taken by the offeror. In the case of an offeror without a record of RELEVANT past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>(2). Performance Confidence will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2). Performance confidence ratings assess the probability of the offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offerors past performance. In assessing past performance confidence, the evaluators will primarily rely on information provided by offerors provided Past Performance information and of that provided to the Govt by the past performance POCs. However, the Government may use data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources to be used in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>(3). The Government will evaluate the offerors ability to successfully complete projects based on demonstrated past and present experience under RECENT and RELEVANT contracts. <br />(a). Recency is defined as projects performed in the last three (3) years. <br />(b). Relevancy is defined as contracts involving cutting and clearing asphalt of similar size and depth to that of this project.<br />(c). The following relevancy definitions, apply:<br />(i). VERY RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(ii). RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(iii). SOMEWHAT RELEVANT: Past/present performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities that this solicitation requires.<br />(iv). NOT RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(4). The process will result in an overall performance rating as defined below. This performance assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offerors demonstrated past and present performance. The ratings are defined as follows:<br />Rating and Description:<br />(i). SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(ii). SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(iii). LIMITED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(iv).NO CONFIDENCE Based on the offerors performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br />(v).UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable or the offerors performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br />(5). If the lowest priced evaluated offer has been determined technically acceptable and is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.<br />(6). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>Additionally, the offeror shall submit:<br />5. Documentation in the form of the manufacturer's literature or other fully descriptive literature detailing the type/model number of the asphalt cutting/demolishing equipment to be used to cut and clear the asphalt on this project. The specifications must include the required 12" deep asphalt cutting capability of the equipment.</p>

<p>&emsp;<br /><strong>Addendum to 52.212-2 - EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br /></strong>(a) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br /><strong>(1) PRICE<br />(2) TECHNICAL<br />(3) PAST PERFORMANCE</strong></p>
<p>Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price when being evaluated.<br />(b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(d). This acquisition will utilize a best value approach, in which the Government seeks to award to an offeror who provides the greatest confidence that they will meet the Government's requirements affordably. The Best Value technique chosen for this particular acquisition will be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT).<br />(e). The PPT approach permits tradeoffs between price/cost and past performance, and will include an evaluation for technical acceptability. All proposals shall first be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the first of the lowest priced proposals shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. In the event that the first evaluated proposal does not yield an offer with an acceptable technical rating, the evaluation process will continue one offer at a time, until a technically acceptable proposal is identified. Contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements, is considered technically acceptable, and will provide the best value to the Government, considering price and past performance. For this acquisition, technical and past performance, when combined, significantly more important than price/cost.<br />(f). Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical acceptability or price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. Discussions or negotiation may be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the 1st Special Operations Contracting Squadron, 350 Tully Street, Hurlburt Field, FL.<br />(g). Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers.<br />(h). Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.<br />(i). To assure timely and equitable evaluation of the proposal, the offeror must follow the instructions contained herein. Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The response shall consist of three (3) separate parts; Part I - Price Proposal, Part II - Technical Proposal, and Part III - Past Performance Information.<br />(j) The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price.<br />(k). Price/Cost Evaluation. Initially proposals shall be ranked in order of price from lowest to highest. Then, the lowest priced proposal shall be evaluated, including any option prices (if applicable). Each offerors' price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness. Unrealistically low proposed costs/prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that either the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal. <br />(l). Technical Evaluation. Offers shall be evaluated independently of the cost/price proposal evaluation to determine the offerors compliance with the technical requirements of this solicitation. The government may make a final determination as to the rating of an offer based on the proposal as submitted without requesting any further information. <br />Technical proposals will be evaluated against the following factors:<br />(a). Project Schedule - as outlined in section C of 52.212-1 paragraph 2.(a)(i).<br />(b). Equipment Submittal as outlined in section C of 52.212-1 paragraph 2.(b) - Documentation in the form of the manufacturer's literature or other fully descriptive literature detailing the type/model number documentation describing specific type/model asphalt cutting/demolishing equipment to be used to cut and clear the asphalt on this project. Specifications must include the capability of cutting/clearing the 12" deep asphalt to be used to. <br />(b). Evaluators shall assign a rating, which falls within one of the following ranges according to the degree to which the offeror meets the minimum requirements described above:<br />(i). ACCEPTABLE - Meets evaluation criteria and minimum requirements. Proposal is acceptable.<br />(ii). UNACCEPTABLE - Fails to meet minimum requirements. Deficiencies are significant and require major revisions to the proposal to make it acceptable. If determined to be unacceptable, this will render the entire proposal as technically unacceptable and eliminate the offeror from further consideration.<br />(c). If all offerors are deemed unacceptable, the government may establish a competitive range and enter into discussions.<br />(m). Past Performance Evaluation: Using data provided by the offeror, the contracting officer shall seek performance information for only those offerors rated technically acceptable.</p>
<p>(1). Each proposal shall provide current and RELEVANT information regarding an offerors actions under previously awarded contracts. Offerors shall identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, local government, and private) for efforts similar to the Government requirement as stated in this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the offerors previous performance in the following areas: Adherence to progress schedules; provide management, technical, and administrative experience; effective quality control; timely submission of submittal data; approach to problem solving; timely resolution of punch list items; and ability to meet contract performance schedule. The Government may evaluate information on problems identified and encountered on previous contracts and corrective actions taken by the offeror. In the case of an offeror without a record of RELEVANT past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>(2). Performance Confidence will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2). Performance confidence ratings assess the probability of the offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offerors past performance. In assessing past performance confidence, the evaluators will primarily rely on information provided by offerors provided Past Performance information and of that provided to the Govt by the past performance POCs. However, the Government may use data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources to be used in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>(3). The Government will evaluate the offerors ability to successfully complete projects based on demonstrated past and present experience under RECENT and RELEVANT contracts. <br />(a). Recency is defined as projects performed in the last three (3) years. <br />(b). Relevancy is defined as contracts involving cutting and clearing asphalt of similar size and depth to that of this project.<br />(c). The following relevancy definitions, apply:<br />(i). VERY RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(ii). RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(iii). SOMEWHAT RELEVANT: Past/present performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities that this solicitation requires.<br />(iv). NOT RELEVANT: Past/present performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />(4). The process will result in an overall performance rating as defined below. This performance assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offerors demonstrated past and present performance. The ratings are defined as follows:<br />Rating and Description:<br />(i). SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(ii). SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(iii). LIMITED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offerors performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(iv).NO CONFIDENCE Based on the offerors performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br />(v).UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable or the offerors performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br />(5). If the lowest priced evaluated offer has been determined technically acceptable and is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.<br />(6). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>Additionally, the offeror shall submit:<br />5. Documentation in the form of the manufacturer's literature or other fully descriptive literature detailing the type/model number of the asphalt cutting/demolishing equipment to be used to cut and clear the asphalt on this project. The specifications must include the required 12" deep asphalt cutting capability of the equipment.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>FAR 52.252-2  Clauses Incorporated By Reference (FEB 1998)

Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing. (f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data.  To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.  Updating information in SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(Part 3/3) FAR 52.252-2 SAM Registration (SEP 2012)
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name of its intention to-- (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible     	 Contracting Officer.

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-866-606-8220 or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<DESC>Market Survey for: <br> Cartridge, 105mm: Illuminating, M314A3 Visible Light (VL) and Cartridge, 105mm: Illuminating, M1064 Infrared (IR) <br>  <br> The US Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, IL, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM CAS), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources that are capable of supplying the following items:  <br>  <br> Cartridge, 105mm: Illuminating, M314A3 Visible Light (VL); NSN: 1315-01-527-4400 Cartridge, 105mm: Illuminating, M1064 Infrared (IR); NSN: 1315-01-562-3730 <br>  <br> The 105mm M314A3 and M1064 are identical illuminating cartridges differing only in the performance of their Illuminating Candles.  While the M314A3 utilizes a visible light illumination composition, the M1064 provides enhanced night time performance by using an infrared composition.  Both cartridges are fired with the M762 series Electronic Time Fuze from the M119 series Howitzer.  They are a ballistic match to one another and use the same firing solutions.   <br>  <br> The United States Government (USG) anticipates using a best value strategy to award a single Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract with five one-year ordering periods with multiple ordering range quantities. The expected period of performance is FY 2015 through FY 2019.  The USG expects to restrict this effort to the National Technology Industrial Base.  The contractor will be responsible for M314A3/M1064 Cartridge production to include Load, Assemble and Pack; quality control, component acquisition; integration and testing; storing; and shipping each cartridge.  Respondents shall have the capability to build a combined quantity of 7,000 (M314A3 and/or M1064) cartridges per ordering period.   <br>  <br> The respondent shall be responsible for providing M314A3 and M1064 Illuminating Cartridges to the USG in accordance with Combination of Adopted Items drawing 13010082 and 13021503 respectively. The USG will provide as Government Furnished Material: the 105mm M14 Cartridge Case (7548409), Candle Assembly (13009272), and Candle Assembly (13020795) as noted on drawing 9206821 (Cartridge, 105mm: Illuminating M314A3) and 13020797 (Cartridge, 105mm, Infrared Illuminating M1064).  A Technical Data Package will not be available until a formal solicitation is announced; however these drawings may be obtained by submitting a signed and completed Non-Disclosure Agreement Form 1350 and a valid DD2345. These documents may be obtained via e-mail by sending a request electronically to the Point of Contact (POC) listed below.   <br>  <br> Interested respondents should provide the USG with the following information about themselves and their primary subcontractors: <br>  <br> a)	Summary of capabilities, description of facilities and equipment relevant to 105mm Artillery munitions production. <br> b)	Description of Quality Management System. <br> c)	Past experience on 105mm Artillery munitions, to include component testing, integration and coordination of necessary activities in support of production. <br> d)	Estimated min/max monthly production rates. <br> e)	Ability to manage technical performance issues with end item and associated sub-assemblies. <br> f)	Whether the company is a Large or Small Business, and CAGE Code.        <br>  <br> Responses to this Market Survey shall be submitted electronically to John Purcell, e-mail john.a.purcell15.civ@mail.mil, no later than 30 days from this publication.  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The USG will accept written questions by e-mail. E-mail your questions directly to POC: John Purcell. All information should be submitted no later than 10/31/ 2013 at no cost or obligation to the USG; information provided will not be returned and will be held as contractor confidential information.

This Request for Information is a call to industry to provide your input to the specification.  The development of the open standard architecture will need to take into account the Army's goals for performance, integration and cost.  <br>  <br> PROBLEM STATEMENT <br>  <br> Program Manager Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (PM WIN-T) Increment 3 is currently developing a product line that will include the capability of full networking on-the-move.  One of the challenges they face is the integration of a SOTM terminal onto ground vehicles such as the  quote mark heavy quote mark  PEO Ground Combat Systems (GCS) / PM Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) vehicles.  Distributed aperture terminals were identified as a technology that will help address this challenge. <br>  <br> Heavy vehicles present several unique integration challenges that can be mitigated by the use of distributed aperture terminals.  Typically, heavy vehicles have turreted weapon systems.  The turret has limited space (both interior and exterior) and power available for integration of a traditional SOTM terminal.  In this respect, a distributed aperture terminal offers additional integration flexibility in that the antennas can be mounted on the sides of the turret or some other suitable location on the exterior of the vehicle, thus presenting a distinct advantage over traditional terminals which must be mounted on the top of the turret.   <br>  <br> One of the main problems with mounting a traditional SOTM terminal on top of the turret is its close proximity to exposed turret personnel.  The SOTM terminal can present a radiation safety hazard to the commander, gunner or any other operator in close proximity to the SOTM terminal.   Distributed aperture terminals can mitigate this radiation hazard because the antennas can be mounted on the sides of the turret (or the sides of main vehicle body) and direct the radiation way from the vehicle hatch, or any other designated area. <br>  <br> When mounting a traditional SOTM terminal on the main body of a turreted vehicle, several other challenges arise.  The line of sight to the satellite can be blocked by the turret, significantly limiting the performance of the SOTM system.  Additionally, traditional SOTM systems also block sight lines and firing lines of the vehicle's own weapon systems.   <br>  <br> Traditional SOTM terminals require a minimum of 400 to 900 square inches of continuous vehicle surface area for antenna placement.  Distributed aperture SOTM terminals may require a similar aggregate area, but without the condition that it be continuous.  For distributed aperture terminals, both the top and the sides of the vehicle may be considered.   <br>  <br> Additional multifaceted challenges include: Functional layout of components that perform down/up conversion, analog to digital conversion, GPS and inertial navigation as well as control and tracking functions can cause difficulties and excessive costs when determining terminal design and placement of distributed SOTM terminal components on the inside or outside of the vehicle.  Additional cable runs and vehicle penetration points may be needed for the distributed aperture solution.  In the case of Heavy vehicles, it will be very restricted, if not forbidden, to add additional breaches to the vehicle hull.  A single entry point is likely required. <br>  <br> BACKGROUND <br>  <br> For several years CERDEC STCD has been developing the concept of distributed aperture SOTM terminals to address the challenges of integrating traditional SATCOM terminals in to vehicles with turrets and large weapon systems.  One of the Government funded Research and Development (R&D) efforts was the  quote mark Small Aperture X-Band Antenna - Distributed Broadband quote mark  or SAXBA BB. <br>  <br> The SAXBA BB terminal was designed and demonstrated to prove the concept of a distributed aperture SOTM terminal at reasonable unit production cost for PM WIN-T (~$150k, in quantities  greater than  100 was an objective for this program).  The SAXBA program was successful in meeting a reasonable unit cost for PM WIN-T.   <br>   <br>   <br> Figure 1.   SAXBA BB Terminal.  Four antenna <br>  subsystems,  and one core terminal subsystem shown. <br>  <br> Another lesson learned from the SAXBA broadband terminal effort has been continued support for the distributed aperture terminal concept.  This support has included funding throughout the life ( greater than  4 years) of the program from PM-WIN-T, as well as great interest from the heavy platform PM community (PEO GCS).    <br>  <br> While many lessons were learned from CERDEC's SAXBA and other Distributed Aperture SOTM research efforts, one question that remains unanswered is: What is the most effective Distributed Aperture SOTM terminal architecture that will allow performance (platform integration, flexible, modular, RF performance, etc) and cost goals to be met in all three frequency bands (X, Ku and Ka)?  <br>  <br> PM-WIN-T has an immediate need to integrate a SOTM terminal onto the heavy vehicles.  As such, CERDEC S&TCD has initiated a four year technology development program entitled, Low Observable Communications - Distributed / Embedded Standard SOTM Terminal Architecture (DESSTA) which started in FY 13. The DESSTA program will answer this need in the near term, but will also keep an eye on the long term goal of developing a family of cost effective terminals.  <br>  <br> The DESSTA program is intended to be a collaborative effort involving CERDEC S&TCD, PM WIN-T and select commercial/non-commercial partners.   DESSTA will first develop a baseline open standard architecture for distributed aperture SOTM terminals in X, Ku and Ka bands, and then develop a Ku band distributed aperture SOTM terminal prototype to align with the needs of the WIN-T program.   <br>  <br> The DESTA open standard architecture development effort for X/Ku and Ka bands will last over a 3-4 year period starting in FY13.  However, a baseline standard architecture for Ku band will be required by the end of FY13.  The baseline standard architecture will be updated as necessary throughout the period of the open standard development.   <br>  <br> The objective of the open standard is to reduce the cost of the distributed aperture terminal by promoting more modular terminal designs.  The standard will define the components of the distributed aperture SOTM terminal, the functionalities of each component, and the common interfaces between each component.  Within each component vendors will be able to implement their unique proprietary solutions.  <br>  <br> The distributed SOTM open standard architecture will be a standard that is not controlled by a single vendor, is not tied to a specific vendor's platform, is available for implementations by multiple sources, is published, and may be used without royalties or the need for non-disclosure agreements. <br>  <br> The DESSTA Ku band distributed aperture SOTM terminal prototype development effort will initiate in FY14, and adhere to the baseline of the open standard architecture.  The development effort will include, but not be limited to: <br> 1.	To design, implement, test and demonstrate (at TRL 6) a distributed aperture SOTM terminal in the Ku-Band over a 2 year period. <br> 2.	The terminal shall be testable to the baseline open standard distributed architecture, in addition to the relevant MIL-STD tests (MIL-STD-810F,MIL-STD-188 -164B). <br>  <br> SCOPE OF THIS RFI <br>  <br> For the purpose of the RFI CERDEC S&TCD is interested in establishing what each vendor considers as the best implementation of an open standard specification for the  architecture of the distributed aperture SOTM terminals in X, Ku and Ka Bands (Note: this is a single architecture that encompasses all three bands).  Additionally, CERDEC is interested in understanding existing component level technologies (antennas designs, low cost array manufacturing techniques, antenna tracking and control systems, etc) that can be used to develop the intended Distributed SATCOM terminal products. <br>  <br> Description of the open standard architecture should include, but not be limited to:  <br> a. The components of the  quote mark Distributed Terminal quote mark .  <br> b. Functionality of each component within the  quote mark Distributed Terminal quote mark . <br> c. What should be considered  quote mark Additional Components quote mark . <br> d. What interfaces exist in your distributed terminal architecture (internal / external). <br> e. Physical aspect (Ethernet cable, RF Cable, etc.) and functional description of each interface. <br> f. Trades used in making these architecture decisions. See next section for discussion. <br>  <br> Description of the Component Technologies and Capabilities: <br>  <br> a. Component name within your standard architecture <br> b. Functionality of each component within the  quote mark Distributed Terminal quote mark . <br> c. Performance of this component within the  quote mark Distributed Terminal quote mark . <br> d. Description of the component technology.   <br> 	For example: An  quote mark Antenna quote mark  component description may include: <br>  <br>  	Antenna element description <br>  	Aperture size (per quadrant) and thickness <br>  	Gain at boresight <br>  	Beamwidths <br>  	Polarization (fixed, selectable) <br>  	Scan limits/scan loss <br>  	Sidelobes/Backlobes <br>  	G/T <br>  	Taper loss (if any) <br>  	Phase shifter configuration (type, number of bits, etc) <br>  	Feed Network <br>  	Beemsteering Methodology  <br>  	Technology Readiness Level (TRL) <br>  	Level of Ruggedization - Environmental, EMI/EMC, etc. <br>  	Costs <br>  	Any other performance parameters that may impact the other components to which this will interface. <br>  <br> An  quote mark Antenna Control Unit quote mark  component may include: <br>  	Tracking Methods: beacon, monopulse, steptrack <br>  	Frequency and Timing sources <br>  	Tracking Loss <br>  	Cost <br>  	Any other performance parameters that may impact the other components to which this will interface. <br>  <br>  <br> ARCHITECTURE TRADES <br>  <br> Developing an open standard architecture will limit what terminals can be built using that architecture.  As such, it is necessary for the Government to understand what factors you considered in your concept for an Open Standard Architecture.  The government will weigh per unit cost, performance, and integration trades in evaluation of your Open Standard Architecture concept.  At a minimum the following relevant considerations should be addressed:  <br>  <br> Performance/Cost: For a distributed aperture terminal, where the conversion from radio frequency (RF) to an intermediate frequency (IF) is done, will greatly impact both the cost and performance.  Direct RF or IF digitization is of interest to the government. <br>  <br> Performance/Integration/Cost:  Which components that are distributed, and which components are outside and inside of the tactical vehicle will impact performance, cost and integration trades. <br>  <br> Performance/Integration/Cost: Low profile and non-traditional antenna designs.  The integration challenge for the heavy vehicles may require the development of low profile and non-traditional antenna designs to optimize performance in limited space.  The architecture should support these antenna designs.   <br>  <br> Additionally, the number of antennas and capability of the antenna needed to support a particular tactical vehicle may vary.  The integration location and space available for integration will drive this. The architecture should support different numbers of antennas as well as significantly different performance.   <br>  <br> Performance/Cost: Dynamic signal combining is an important aspect of the distribute aperture terminal architecture.  RF signals received on multiple antenna components will need to be combined such that the G/T of the system can be maximized when operating On-The-Move.  The open standard architecture should support this. <br>  <br> Performance/Cost: Control and tracking operations while on the move is a critical aspect of today's Tactical SATCOM terminals. Satellite acquisition, open and closed loop tracking, terminal calibration, OTM operations in the tactical environment (shock, vibe, terminal behavior during blockages, and blockage recovery) are all key elements of the architecture and terminal design.   <br>  <br> Integration: SWAP, EMI/EMC, radiation hazard safety, blockage of firing/sight lines, blockage of LOS to the satellite, vehicle penetrations for cable routing, cable length / loss / durability, and redundancy: single point of failure. <br>  <br> PRODUCTS THE ARMY ANTICIPATES DEVELOPING FROM THE OPEN STANDARD ARCHITECTURE <br>  <br> From this open standard architecture the intent is to build products with the following attributes:   <br>  <br> -	Distributed SOTM terminals which are fully functional and independent of all other systems, with exception to the need for vehicle power, a satellite signal (for receive) and a modem.  These systems are required to acquire, track and pass data to/from the modem.   Additionally, Distributed SOTM terminal will interface with a computer initial control, setup and maintenance of the terminal. <br> -	SOTM products with improved integration viability on heavy tactical vehicles. Specific examples of heavy tactical vehicles are Bradley, Abrams, and Stryker.  Specific examples of integration challenges are provided in the PROBLEM STATEMENT section of this document. <br> -	Antenna components/subsystems will be distributed around the vehicle. <br> -	The number of antennas and performance of the components/subsystems may vary by platform.   <br> -	Line Replaceable Modules (/Components) LRM.  Each component in the architecture shall have an open and standard interface.  Each component shall be replaceable to improve performance and/or reduce cost. <br> -	Dynamic signal combining on receive from multiple antenna components/subsystems when operating On-The-Move. <br> -	Low profile antenna systems: Can be mounted on the top or side of a vehicle.  <br> -	Terminals will be designed to meet PM WIN-T Soldier Network Extension (SNE) (Threshold) and Point of Presence (PoP) terminal requirements. Below are the G/T and EIRP requirements for a phased array antennas to meet the POP objective requirement to close a 512 Kb/s data rate (full duplex) link: <br> X Band, G/T= 2.14/1.81 dB/K, EIRP= 36.69 dBW (Minimum @ 45 degrees). <br> Ku Band, G/T=7.17/5.98 dB/K, EIRP=43.27 dBW (Minimum @ 45 degrees) with size minimized. <br> Ka Band, G/T= 11.858/10.755 dB/K, EIRP= 40.87 dBW (Minimum @ 45 degrees).  <br> 	 <br> Note phased arrays above are assumed to be mounted at 45 degrees to horizon, and angles above reference degrees above the horizon.    Pointing losses of 0.5 dB are included in G/T and EIRP numbers.  All bands assume operation with a 2.4m hub.   <br>  <br> -	Scan angles: The 360 degrees in azimuth is a threshold requirement for most systems.  However, multiple antennas can be used to achieve this.  In elevation, 100 degrees is an objective requirement, 50 degrees is the threshold requirement. <br> -	Products shall be designed such that the unit cost goals can be achieved:  less than $100k (Objective) per terminal, or less than $250k (Threshold) per terminal, in quantities  greater than  100.  This includes all components above the modem in the RF Chain (Assume the RF chain starts at the antenna aperture, and flows down to the modem.)  This unit cost target is typically a single band / single beam system. <br> -	Single and Multi-beam systems. <br> -	Multi-band systems (X/Ku/Ka). <br> -	Bands of interest: X (7.25 -7.75 GHz Rx, 7.9-8.4 GHz Tx), Ku (10.95 -12.75 GHz Rx, 13.75-14.5 GHz Tx) and Ka (19.7-21.2 GHz Rx, 29.5-31 GHz Tx). <br> -	Open and closed loop acquisition and tracking systems. <br> -	Modem agnostic SOTM systems. <br>  <br>  <br> LEVERAGE <br>  <br> CERDEC S&TCD is interested in leveraging any industry efforts currently in the development of a similar interface, and is seeking information in this regard.   One effort that can be leveraged is the Government Reference Architecture (GRA).  The GRA defines a standard SOTM architecture which is applicable for Protected Communications Terminals. While the open standard architecture developed under this RFI does NOT include Protected Communications Terminals, some of the GRA content and concepts may be applicable to X, Ku, Ka band terminals as well.  For example, the GRA provides commands for each interface that may be leveraged in our Distributed Aperture Terminal Interface. GRA documentation is available upon request. <br>  <br> DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS <br>  <br> Interested parties are requested to respond to the RFI by describing their technical capabilities, displaying experience developing similar SOTM terminals and SOTM apertures.

As such, it is necessary for the Government to understand what factors you considered in your concept for an Open Standard Architecture.  The government will weigh per unit cost, performance, and integration trades in evaluation of your Open Standard Architecture concept.  At a minimum the following relevant considerations should be addressed:   <br>    <br>  Performance/Cost: For a distributed aperture terminal, where the conversion from radio frequency (RF) to an intermediate frequency (IF) is done, will greatly impact both the cost and performance.  Direct RF or IF digitization is of interest to the government.  <br>    <br>  Performance/Integration/Cost:  Which components that are distributed, and which components are outside and inside of the tactical vehicle will impact performance, cost and integration trades.  <br>    <br>  Performance/Integration/Cost: Low profile and non-traditional antenna designs.  The integration challenge for the heavy vehicles may require the development of low profile and non-traditional antenna designs to optimize performance in limited space.  The architecture should support these antenna designs.    <br>    <br>  Additionally, the number of antennas and capability of the antenna needed to support a particular tactical vehicle may vary.  The integration location and space available for integration will drive this. The architecture should support different numbers of antennas as well as significantly different performance.    <br>    <br>  Performance/Cost: Dynamic signal combining is an important aspect of the distribute aperture terminal architecture.  RF signals received on multiple antenna components will need to be combined such that the G/T of the system can be maximized when operating On-The-Move.  The open standard architecture should support this.  <br>    <br>  Performance/Cost: Control and tracking operations while on the move is a critical aspect of today's Tactical SATCOM terminals. Satellite acquisition, open and closed loop tracking, terminal calibration, OTM operations in the tactical environment (shock, vibe, terminal behavior during blockages, and blockage recovery) are all key elements of the architecture and terminal design.    <br>    <br>  Integration: SWAP, EMI/EMC, radiation hazard safety, blockage of firing/sight lines, blockage of LOS to the satellite, vehicle penetrations for cable routing, cable length / loss / durability, and redundancy: single point of failure.  <br>    <br>  PRODUCTS THE ARMY ANTICIPATES DEVELOPING FROM THE OPEN STANDARD ARCHITECTURE  <br>    <br>  From this open standard architecture the intent is to build products with the following attributes:    <br>    <br>  -	Distributed SOTM terminals which are fully functional and independent of all other systems, with exception to the need for vehicle power, a satellite signal (for receive) and a modem.  These systems are required to acquire, track and pass data to/from the modem.   Additionally, Distributed SOTM terminal will interface with a computer initial control, setup and maintenance of the terminal.  <br>  -	SOTM products with improved integration viability on heavy tactical vehicles. Specific examples of heavy tactical vehicles are Bradley, Abrams, and Stryker.  Specific examples of integration challenges are provided in the PROBLEM STATEMENT section of this document.  <br>  -	Antenna components/subsystems will be distributed around the vehicle.  <br>  -	The number of antennas and performance of the components/subsystems may vary by platform.    <br>  -	Line Replaceable Modules (/Components) LRM.  Each component in the architecture shall have an open and standard interface.  Each component shall be replaceable to improve performance and/or reduce cost.  <br>  -	Dynamic signal combining on receive from multiple antenna components/subsystems when operating On-The-Move.  <br>  -	Low profile antenna systems: Can be mounted on the top or side of a vehicle.   <br>  -	Terminals will be designed to meet PM WIN-T Soldier Network Extension (SNE) (Threshold) and Point of Presence (PoP) terminal requirements. Below are the G/T and EIRP requirements for a phased array antennas to meet the POP objective requirement to close a 512 Kb/s data rate (full duplex) link:  <br>  X Band, G/T= 2.14/1.81 dB/K, EIRP= 36.69 dBW (Minimum @ 45 degrees).  <br>  Ku Band, G/T=7.17/5.98 dB/K, EIRP=43.27 dBW (Minimum @ 45 degrees) with size minimized.  <br>  Ka Band, G/T= 11.858/10.755 dB/K, EIRP= 40.87 dBW (Minimum @ 45 degrees).   <br>  	  <br>  Note phased arrays above are assumed to be mounted at 45 degrees to horizon, and angles above reference degrees above the horizon.    Pointing losses of 0.5 dB are included in G/T and EIRP numbers.  All bands assume operation with a 2.4m hub.    <br>    <br>  -	Scan angles: The 360 degrees in azimuth is a threshold requirement for most systems.  However, multiple antennas can be used to achieve this.  In elevation, 100 degrees is an objective requirement, 50 degrees is the threshold requirement.  <br>  -	Products shall be designed such that the unit cost goals can be achieved:  less than $100k (Objective) per terminal, or less than $250k (Threshold) per terminal, in quantities  greater than  100.  This includes all components above the modem in the RF Chain (Assume the RF chain starts at the antenna aperture, and flows down to the modem.)  This unit cost target is typically a single band / single beam system.  <br>  -	Single and Multi-beam systems.  <br>  -	Multi-band systems (X/Ku/Ka).  <br>  -	Bands of interest: X (7.25 -7.75 GHz Rx, 7.9-8.4 GHz Tx), Ku (10.95 -12.75 GHz Rx, 13.75-14.5 GHz Tx) and Ka (19.7-21.2 GHz Rx, 29.5-31 GHz Tx).  <br>  -	Open and closed loop acquisition and tracking systems.  <br>  -	Modem agnostic SOTM systems.  <br>    <br>    <br>  LEVERAGE  <br>    <br>  CERDEC S&TCD is interested in leveraging any industry efforts currently in the development of a similar interface, and is seeking information in this regard.   One effort that can be leveraged is the Government Reference Architecture (GRA).  The GRA defines a standard SOTM architecture which is applicable for Protected Communications Terminals.

<p><br />III. CLARIFICATIONS</p>
<p>The following are clarifications from the original RFI Posting:</p>
<p>A. Bullet 8 Under the Letter of Intent (LOI) should state "Describe your company's ability to manage and secure up to SECRET information." The respondent can provide a full response up to SECRET NOFORN that is in compliance with current DoD directives and procedures (i.e. DOD 5200.22-M, SECNAV M-5510.36, DOD 5200.01) as stated in the original posting.<br />B. The GFI NDA shall be signed by an authorized company representative on behalf of both GFI Package 1(Unclassified) and GFI Package 2 (Classified), and this shall be provided with the LOI according to the timelines/directions provided in the original posting. In addition, the employees that view or handle the classified data in GFI Package 2 will need to sign the NDA. The employee level signatures that will view or handle the classified data in GFI Package 2 on the NDA are due via email to Mr. Antoine Mathews (antoine.d.mathews@navy.mil) no later than 5:00 PM EST September 17, 2013. <br />C. For industry day, the signed GFI NDA at the company level is a requirement for attendance of personnel from that company. As classified information will be presented at industry day, a signed GFI NDA is also required for the individual employees that attend Industry day. Industry day attendees must submit their signed GFI NDA via email to Mr. Antoine Mathews (antoine.d.mathews@navy.mil) no later than 5:00 PM EST September 25, 2013. Please note that this does not relax the deadline for GFI NDAs for the employees that will receive (view or handle) the mailed GFI Package 2. This is a separate requirement to protect the information being presented. If the employee has signed and submitted a GFI NDA to view or handle the classified data in GFI Package 2 by the deadline, a second GFI NDA submittal for industry attendance is not required.<br />D. The DD-254 and the Draft Security Class Guide will be provided with the classified information in GFI Package 2 instead of GFI Package 1 that was stated in the original posting.<br />E. The Classified POC that will receive the GFI Package 2 must have at least a Full SECRET clearance. The information regarding the Classified POC can be sent in one of two ways:<br />a. The Classified POC cleared to receive the classified portion of the GFI (GFI Package 2) includes their Social Security Number with the LOI; the LOI is due to Mr. Antoine Mathews (antoine.d.mathews@navy.mil) no later than 5:00 PM EST September 13, 2013. Please note that the Common Access Card (CAC) EDIPI number that was listed in the original posting is no longer an option.<br />b. POC cleared to receive the classified portion of the GFI submits a classified visit request, which can be faxed to (301)995-1018 or sent by encrypted email to ashley.salzman.ctr@navy.mil (cc cindy.febus@navy.mil). Classified Visit Requests need to be on official company letterhead including: name, SSN, DOB, Place of Birth, Date/ Level of Clearance, Date/Purpose of meeting, and signed by the company security representative. The POC for the visit request will be Mr. Antoine Mathews (301) 757-5704. If this option is chosen, the deadline is 5:00 PM EST September 13, 2013.<br />F. Regarding the LOI page limit of 6 pages, the GFI NDA pages will not count towards the page limit.<br />G. Respondents must verify in the LOI that the Classified Mailing Address that is associated with the CAGE Code is able to receive FEDEX packages for the mailing of the Classified GFI Package (GFI Package 2).</p>
<p>IV. FULL RESPONSE SUBMISSIONS UPDATE</p>
<p>As a change from the original posting, full response submissions will no longer be accepted at the unclassified level. Full responses MUST be submitted at the classified level (up to SECRET NOFORN); unclassified responses will be returned without being assessed or considered. The data contained within the response may be unclassified, but the transmittal of the data must be at the classified level (up to SECRET NOFORN) in order to fully protect the information.</p>
<p>Provide classified full responses no later than 5:00 PM EST October 15, 2013 via two hardcopies and CD ROM with electronic media that is Microsoft Office 2010 compatible. The outer envelope addressed to:</p>

<p>This update provides the following files:</p>
<p>(1) Q&amp;A Form,<br />(2) Q&amp;A Log, and <br />(3) DRAFT RFP comprised only of Sections B-K.</p>
<p>Note that Item 1, the Q&amp;A Form, is the requisite tool for communicating to the prescribed contacts any questions regarding this matter.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ORIGINAL POSTING:</p>
<p>This is notice that the Naval Air Warfare Center, Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) intends to solicit proposals for a potential contract award. The underlying subject-matter is the project identified as 'H-53E Enhanced Aircrew Externals Trainers Device 2H162, 2H164-1, and 2H164-2' (Project). This Project primarily requires the production and delivery of three H-53E Enhanced Aircrew Externals Trainers (EAETs). As the name suggests, EAETs provide a platform for aircrew training on procedures and communications in H-53E day and night external cargo operations.</p>
<p>There are different arrangements that apply for the three EAETs that will result from this Project. Two of them are for the United States (US) Marine Corps. These two EAETs have delivery dates set to occur, respectively, at fifteen and seventeen months after the contract award. The Marine Corps installations that will receive them are Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River, North Carolina, and MCAS Miramar, California.</p>
<p>One of the EAETs, an option requirement, is for the US Navy. This one has a prescribed delivery date of twenty-four months after the contract award. The Navy installation that will house this EAET is Naval Station (NS) Norfolk.</p>
<p>The impending contract action will be competed pursuant to FAR 19.502-2, Total Small Business Set-Asides. As such, FAR Clauses 52.219-6 and 52.219-14 will apply. Still, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation (as applicable) which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>This notice is intended to satisfy the requirement at FAR 5.204, Presolicitation Notices. When a solicitation is made available, a subsequent notice will be provided as required at FAR 5.201, making the solicitation available pursuant to FAR 5.102. Please recognize that this notice is not itself a request for proposals (RFP) concerning a competition acquisition; it serves only to raise awareness of a possible contracting opportunity that stands imminent. For questions regarding the matter, contact the responsible Contract Specialist, Mr. La'Venji Daniels, at (407) 380-4762 or lavenji.daniels@navy.mil.</p>

Although this is not an all- inclusive list, the COTS/GFE typically delivered/integrated may consist of sensors, communications equipment, towers, and small shelters.  In some cases, minor construction may be required.  This effort will often involve working in austere conditions in countries that may not have an established infrastructure that can be leveraged during performance of this effort.   This CIIS requirement includes efforts covered under the current multiple award Maritime Surveillance Systems (MSS) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts awarded in September 2008.  The incumbents to the September 2008 MSS award are:  	N00039-08-D-0010 C4 Planning Solutions LLC 	N00039-08-D-0011 Cambridge Communication Systems, Inc. 	N00039-08-D-0012 Forward Slope, Inc. 	N00039-08-D-0013 Management Services Group, Inc.  This CIIS effort will be a multiple award IDIQ contract.  Details on the IDIQ and initial Delivery Order(s) (DO(s)) will be provided in a future update to this release.  A draft IDIQ Statement of Work (SOW) is provided for your information.  A draft of RFP Sections L and M will be provided in the mid- to late-June 2013 timeframe.  It is anticipated that the final RFP will be issued in late 4th quarter FY13 with award within six (6) months of RFP release.  It is SPAWAR's intention to hold an Industry Day/Pre-Proposal Conference with interested small business firms.  This Industry Day/Pre-Proposal Conference will be held in San Diego, CA, during the July/August 2013 timeframe. Specifics on the date and location will be provided as soon as they are finalized.  The purpose of this Industry Day/Pre-Proposal Conference is to discuss the requirements and the proposal format and to also address questions on the contracting strategies being utilized by the Government. All questions MUST be submitted in writing to carla.brown@navy.mil and rachel.jimenez1@navy.mil as soon as possible but no later than COB 18 June 2013. There will also be the opportunity for contractors to ask questions and provide comments in an open forum during the Industry Day/Pre-Proposal Conference; these questions/comments will be addressed by the Government to the degree possible. THERE WILL BE NO ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS FOLLOWING THE GOVERNMENT PRESENTATION.  No cameras, tape recorders, or other reproduction devices are allowed during this meeting. All submitted questions and answers will be made publicly available on the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website (http://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil) following the Industry Day/Pre-Proposal Conference.  Due to possible space limitations, attendance will be limited to two (2) representatives from a small-business contractor; one (1) of these representatives must be from the small business, the other representative is at the small business's discretion.  Details on the RSVP process will be provided at a later date.  For those who are unable to attend, information and instructions to access the briefing material will be available at a later date.

<DESC>The Sacramento District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has an upcoming acquisition to establish contracts to construct cutoff walls using the jet grout method along the waterside slope of the levee in Sacramento, California. <br /><br />Site R3A is located on the right bank of the American River at the Capitol City Freeway Bridge. The gap in the cutoff wall extends approximately 325 feet. The Capitol City Freeway crosses the levee in the north-south direction through the middle of the gap. Using jet grouting, the soil cement cutoff walls will be extended toward the Capitol City Freeway but not completely across the Freeway. The cutoff wall would be installed to within 10 feet of the edge of both sides of Capitol City Freeway, with approximately 88 feet on the upstream side of the freeway and approximately 83 feet on the downstream side. Extending the cutoff wall from the existing limits to within 10 feet of the edge of pavement would capture seepage in this area. <br /><br />Site L10 is located on the left/south bank of the American River at Howe Avenue. A 200-foot window at the site is proposed to be closed with approximately 345 linear feet of cutoff wall using the jet grout method along the waterside slope of the levee. The proposed cutoff walls will begin 15 feet before the end of the existing slurry cutoff wall, running parallel and adjacent to the existing walls for 25 feet. It will then turn at an angle and run down the waterside slope of the levees, then turn and continue parallel to and offset from the levee crown. It will turn at an angle to run up the waterside slope to the levee crown of the levee, and then turn and continue for an additional 24 feet parallel and adjacent to the existing slurry cutoff wall. After the jet grout cutoff wall is installed, a blanket of low permeability material will be placed on the waterside slope of the levee. The blanket will begin 10 feet beyond the cutoff wall centerline, and extend up the slope. Finally, the existing riprap slope protection will be removed and replaced after construction on the waterside slope under the bridges to prevent erosion. In addition, an approximately 175-foot section of the existing levee upstream of Howe Avenue will be raised by approximately 1 foot to provide required flood protection. <br /><br />The Contractor shall use a jet grouting system for constructing cutoff walls at both sites. The Contractor shall also be able to jet grout around existing utilities, to be protected in place. <br /><br />Acquisition Information: <br /><br />This acquisition is proceeding as a Request for Proposals (RFP) using the Trade-off Method. This RFP is a Competitive, Unrestricted Full and Open Competition and all businesses may respond. <br /><br />Estimated Cost Range is between $1,000,000 $5,000,000 <br /><br />Period of Performance for Construction: 120 Days. <br /><br />This Procurement will be conducted under FSC CODE: Z2PZ, SIC CODE: 1629, NAICS Code: 238110. The size standard for this code is $14,000,000. All questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Marsha Sells, at (916) 557-5232, FAX: No.: (916) 557-5278, e-mail marsha.r.sells@usace.army.mil. <br /><br />Information about the time and location of the site visit/pre-proposal conference will be found in Section 00 21 00 of the solicitation. If you need assistance with downloading the plans or specs or registering as an Interested Vendor, please contact the Contract Specialist. <br /><br /><br />It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about September 30, 2013, for downloading at the Government's website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. No paper copies will be issued. <br /><br />The specific date and time will be identified in the solicitation.

The USAMMDA and USAMMA develop new drugs, vaccines, devices and medical support equipment that enhance readiness, ensure the provision of the highest quality medical and preventative care to the DoD, and maximize survival of medical casualties on the battlefield.  The USAMMDA and USAMMA direct, control, manage, and focus the development of medical materiel systems to meet Service-unique and joint Service performance, schedule, and cost requirements.       <br>          <br>   The USAMMDA and USAMMA Project Managers develop and field medical products for the US Armed Forces in conjunction with the Army Medical Department Center and School (the combat developer) and other service inputs (external partners).  Project Manager assigns product development to individual product managers and the product managers (PdMs), with support from the Division of Regulated Activities and Compliance (DRAC) and Clinical Support Services Division (CSSD), take promising new concepts and technologies developed in the USAMRMC laboratories and in the academic and commercial sectors, manage the development and testing of prototypes of these products (as necessary), and manage the products through the development lifecycle, ultimately to achieve US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, licensure and /or clearance, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registration, and/or approval of the developed product, to include post marketing commitments, for use by our Service Members through the requirements defined in the DoD and Army acquisitions processes (DoD 5000 series).  Thus, the USAMMDA and USAMMA product managers are responsible for the success (including cost/schedule/ performance) of the product development effort and must manage Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) through the development and implementation of development plans (and other acquisition requirements, as applicable), to develop and field medical materiel.  The USAMMDA and USAMMA accomplish their respective missions by exercising four core capabilities:  (1) Defense Acquisition and Program Management; (2) Regulatory Affairs (FDA or EPA regulated products); (3) Medical Product Development; and, (4) Coordination of The Surgeon General's Executive Agent management of Force Health Protection's IND products.     <br>          <br>   Depending on the product development strategy, the Office of the Surgeon General (OTSG), Department of the Army, may be the regulatory sponsor.  For these product development efforts, DRAC and CSSD are the regulatory elements responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable regulations.  In these cases, DRAC and CSSD may execute FDA regulated sponsor responsibilities or delegate some or all of these responsibilities to the Prime or its subcontractor and only provide oversight of these activities. In other cases, the product development effort will include industry or academia partners who hold the regulatory Sponsorship, which may also include foreign government marketing strategies.  The DRAC and CSSD may provide oversight of regulated activities sponsored by partners, depending on the capabilities or requests of the partner.  Specific requirements will be variable and included in detail at the task order level.     <br>          <br>   Additionally, DRAC and CSSD provide regulatory affairs and medical product development support for other organizations outside of USAMMDA and USAMMA, including USAMRMC subordinate commands, and the Chemical and Biological Defense Program.  These organizations may utilize this contract vehicle to conduct product development activities, which are being sponsored by OTSG and supported by USAMMDA DRAC and CSSD.     <br>          <br>   The CBMS Joint Project Management Office is responsible for research, development, acquisition, fielding, and life cycle management of FDA-approved medical systems for protection, treatment, and diagnostic capabilities against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat agents.  All CBRN medical countermeasures are approved by and regulated through the FDA.  The CBMS continues to aggressively explore opportunities to partner with other government agencies, industry, academia, and allied countries for all CBRN medical countermeasure efforts.  The CBMS product portfolio includes products spanning the entire acquisition life cycle.       <br>        <br>   Objective:     <br>          <br>   The objective of this requirement is to facilitate the timely and efficient execution of the US Army's medical materiel development program by providing a mechanism for all aspects of medical product/device development and life cycle support, including project management, technical expertise/assistance, strategic planning, market analysis, training, administrative activities, and pharmaceutical manufacturing and testing, assay validation, validated storage and shipment, non-clinical testing, clinical research (to include monitoring, safety pharmacovigilance and surveillance, full data management, and biostatistical support), regulatory writing and submission support, regulatory strategy and consultation, quality, integrated logistics support, equipment maintenance support and information technology in support of each task order.  For example:  a task order may specify that a contractor will conduct clinical trials worldwide (inclusive of pre-trial activities, trial activities and post trial activities),  provide product managers with support services to assist/provide technical guidance and provide independent and objective reviews, site feasibility assessments, prepare and assemble both generic and product-specific US FDA and EPA related documentation, take meeting minutes, provide complete clinical monitoring support including compilation of Sponsor trial master files, provide a data management system , preferably an electronic data capture (EDC) system, compliant with FDA/ICH regulations and guidance, data management, biostatistical evaluation and data analysis, safety pharmacovigilance and surveillance, and complete a final clinical study report compliant with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and/or FDA regulations and guidance.      <br>          <br>   Period of Performance:      <br>          <br>   The Period of Performance for this contract will be a five year base period with five one-year option periods.      <br>          <br>   Response:      <br>          <br>   This notice is for informational purposes only.  No response is required for this presolicitation notice.  Telephone requests in response to this presolicitation notice will not be honored.  Additional information is not available at this time.

<DESC>Develop research tools and methodologies that support early analysis of flight-critical softwareintensive systems whose components, and their functions with respect to the controlled hardware,are composed into verifiable complex systems. This includes a variety of topics: design framework for early combined analysis of software and hardware embedded systems analysis techniques at the system architecture level, generating system-level assumptions for the verification of safety properties at the component level, lifting of component-level safety properties to the system level, composition of results from multiple verification engines into a single, coherent argument, compositional verification for synchronous and asynchronous systems.

Comparison of measurements between the NOAA Baseline Observatory in Barrow, Alaska and the Tiksi HMO will enhance understanding of fundamental Arctic processes and resulting impacts on weather, shipping, human health, and commerce.
<p>The objective of this requirement is to collect quality data and samples from the Tiksi HMO which provides information on greenhouse gases, atmospheric and surface radiation, black carbon, pollutants, winds, temperatures, humidity, and atmosphere/surface exchanges in the near-surface boundary layer, clouds, climate-grade meteorological measurements, and atmospheric aerosol.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide regular on-site operator cleaning and checks of automated data collection systems to ensure quality data collection. The contractor shall report on data collection activities. The contractor will collect and ship physical air samples directly to NOAA laboratories in Boulder, CO. The contractor will deliver metadata on environmental factors such as wind direction, power outages, and burning events that can affect data quality. The contractor will provide shipping and reporting necessary for supporting data collection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />4. Statutory Authority<br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. Section 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."</p>
<p>5. Contractor's Unique Qualifications<br />This contract will support MWCS-28 in its mission to provide reliable unclassified and classified Internet Protocol (IP) telephone services at tactical locations supporting two (2) concurrent operations. Each Company must have the capability to establish one (1) Publisher at their main site and one (1) Subscriber at an alternate site for redundancy for both the unclassified and the classified network platform. One (1) Publisher and one (1) Subscriber comprise one (1) Cluster. With four (4) Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) Clusters for two (2) Companies, each Company will have the capability to employ and control one (1) unclassified and one (1) classified CUCM cluster that will provide reliable/redundant IP telephone services.</p>
<p>MWCS-28 requires the means to provide reliable/redundant unclassified and classified IP telephone services during exercises such as Mailed Fist, Pegasus Flight, MISTEX, MEFEX and 2d MAW operations. This procurement is crucial to meet operational requirements mandated by the Department of Defense (DoD) when conducting exercises or operations in all environments (Contiguous United States (CONUS) and Outside Contiguous United States (OCONUS)). CUCM 8.6 meets all of the critical interoperability requirements, is certified for joint use, and is in compliance with Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) Unified Capabilities (UC) Approved Products List (APL). MWCS-28 will have the capability to conduct IP telephone services independently, conduct two (2) concurrent operations/exercises, and provide redundant IP Telephone Services from two (2) sites in support of Marine Air Command and Control Systems (MACCS) agencies.</p>
<p>MWCS-28 currently deploys CUCM systems to provide voice over internet protocol (VoIP) phone services in a tactical environment. This request will enhance CUCM capabilities and address existing shortfalls. In addition, the CUCM products suite is the default United Communication solutions for the United States Marine Corps in a tactical environment and is currently deployed in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Training is offered by the Marine Corps Communication Electronic School (MCCES) via the Communication Training Centers (CTC) alleviating additional training costs.</p>
<p>The UCS C220 M2 server manufactured by Cisco Systems is the only physical hardware platform that can run an instance of a virtualized CUCM 8.6 while maintaining full Cisco maintenance and configuration support. Instances of virtualized CUCM 8.6 are not supported on any hardware other than Cisco hardware. The Cisco UCS C220 M2 listed in the table above meets the requirement to operate under the JITC certification.</p>
<p>Proficiency to maintain, refresh, configure, and train dictates that Cisco equipment is procured in order to minimize further costs.</p>
<p>6. Competition/Fair Opportunity<br />This procurement will be competed under the GWAC-SEWP IV. Competition Requirements, when using a SEWP contract per FAR 16.505(b)(1), provides that each contractor shall be given fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding 3,000.00. At a minimum, to provide Fair Opportunity, all contract holders within any one of the four individual competed Groups must be provided opportunity. For maximum competition one, two, three or all four Groups can be selected. The SEWP online RFI/RFQ tool is the recommended method to assist in this activity and to augment the required decision documentation.</p>
<p>7. Fair and Reasonable Pricing<br />The SEWP contracts are Part 12 Commercial Contracts and additional price analysis was done in accordance with the following: The price design for SEWP is a negotiated discount off the offeror's commercial list price. Price analysis was conducted in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(1), to ensure that a "fair and reasonable" price is paid by the Government. Reasonableness of proposed prices was established in accordance with 15.403- 1(c)(1)(i)(B) which provides that a price is based on adequate price competition if two or more responsible offerors, competing independently, submit priced offers that satisfy the Government's expressed requirement and there is not any finding that the price of an otherwise successful offer is unreasonable. To verify price reasonableness, offerors were instructed to submit their published price catalog or published schedule of list prices in a form regularly maintained by the manufacturer or offerors, such as a catalog, price list, schedule, or other verifiable and established record. Additionally, each contractor offered a discount off of product categories (such as input-output device) of IT equipment. These discounts remain for the life of the contract. Therefore, when new technology is added or list prices change due to market fluctuations, the SEWP price remains fair and reasonable. One additional piece of information, NASA contracts state that a SEWP Prime Contractor cannot offer prices higher on their SEWP contract than is offered on their GSA contract.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research<br />Market Research was conducted via the SEWP IV "product search" function on the SEWP IV website. CISCO does not quote directly on solicitations; however, there are more than three CISCO authorized partners or resellers on SEWP IV capable of providing this requirement. The Contracting Officer reasonably expects more than three quotations pertaining to this RFQ. A Request for Information was posted in order to notify potential quoters of an expected requirement and obtain sources of supply.</p>
<p>9. Other Fact<br />No additional facts.</p>
<p>10. A statement of actions the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers<br />No actions are currently available to remove or overcome any barriers that preclude the Agency from meeting the requirements, due to the compatibility issues of existing hardware with items being procured. However, before any subsequent acquisitions for this supply are pursued, detailed market research will be performed to determine if any new sources are available for this brand of equipment.</p>
