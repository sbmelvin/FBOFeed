<p><br />WAWF INSTRUCTIONS <br />To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DOD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DOD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact.</p>
<p>For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly:</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<BR><BR>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<BR><BR>(End of clause)<BR><BR><BR><BR>52.212-5 CONTRACTTERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (FEB 2008) <BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:<BR><BR>(1) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553).<BR><BR>(2) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Pub.

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.
Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.
Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Introduction</p>
<p>1. The project is to provide the system and equipment to allow a radio station based at Lashkar Gar to provide sustaining radio audio for multiple remote radio stations in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>2. The proposed system is transmitted by satellite system to the radio stations (Radio in a Box RIAB) situated in remote locations in other parts of Afghanistan. The RIAB service can be un-encrypted on the up-link to the satellite, but on the turn around it should then become encrypted and will only be able to be received by utilizing a smart-card or other such decryption device at the final destinations.</p>
<p>3. All Products and systems provided under this scope shall be fully functioning or capable of functioning at full capacity but for Government action within 12 weeks of the date of contract. All products or systems shall be compatible for use with Ramsey Radio in a box (RIAB) 300W, 110VAC, FM stereo broadcast system model # PXB30010D93S.</p>
<p><br />Vsat Cabin</p>
<p>1. Provide all equipment and a suitable cabin to be based at Lashkar Gah which will house the equipment required to provide the up-link for all the programming that is created in LashKar Gah by the RIAB studio which is to be disseminated to the receivers located in other areas within Afghanistan. The system shall be installed in a modified 10 ft (1/4) ISO container or similar cabin that can be handled by the same equipment as can handle an ISO container. This allows the system to be moved utilizing standard container moving equipment, and the shipping weight should not exceed 2,500 kg. The container is to be placed at a location within Lashkar Gar of military's choosing.</p>
<p>2. All equipment shall be installed inside the container except the dish, which shall be mounted on top of the container. This configuration minimizes local radiation hazard and system ground footprint. Internal mains distribution should be installed, with an internally mounted mains circuit breaker unit, distributing power to the Air-conditioning, the satellite equipment, mains sockets and lighting. The internal equipment should be rack and wall mounted with the required internal/external connections being made via an interface panel in the side of the cabin. An external mains connector should be mounted on the side of the container to which the external supply can be connected. The supply rating is to be 240/220 volt 30 KVA. however:</p>
<p>3. This equipment is to be dual thread, although not necessarily with automatic change-over. The equipment is to be capable of taking a stereo audio feed from the radio station and transmitting it as a satellite carrier. The system should comprise of a single active system alongside a de-activated system within the cabin. This will enable the engineer to change over to the de-activated system upon failure and for maintenance.</p>
<p>4. The cabin is to be fitted with air-conditioning. The container should be air-conditioned employing a split system to reduce dust ingress, the external units being protected by a cage at the rear of the container. There should be two systems with normal operation requiring only one of the systems to be running at any time. During routine maintenance these systems will be changed over to give even wear and tear to both. The military will provide local support and maintenance to the ACU system.</p>
<p>5. When the cabin has been delivered to LashKar Gah, arrangements will then be made for the offeror to install, conduct alignment with the satellite and set to work. The system will be located within a secure military compound, secured by British or US Military security forces and be accessible to staff utilizing civilian Contractors ID's issued to them by the British or US authorities after suitable security checks have been made.</p>
<p>6. Upon completion, the offeror will conduct training in LashKar Gah on the equipment and discuss any local issues that arise. The training should allow the operator to:<br />i. Transfer files from the RIAB studio's recording equipment (or a standard PC/Mac computer) to the uplink<br />ii.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

If requested, an independent review of an Agency Protest decision is available through appeal to the Senior Contracting Official (SCO) in accordance with FAR 33.103. A protest to C3 is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The C3 Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within C3, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the Agency Protest, the Agency Protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>(b) An interested party may file a written protest to the Contracting Officer under the C3 Agency Protest program for contract solicitations issued by C3. Such Agency Protests are limited to objections to any of the following:</p>
<p>(1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.<br />(2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.<br />(3) An award or proposed award of the contract.<br />(4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.</p>
<p>(c) An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this provision for resolution of protests.</p>
<p>(d) For the purpose of filing a C3 Agency Protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.</p>
<p>(e) An Agency Protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number or e-mail address; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of Contracting Officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an Agency Protest for decision by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(f) C3 Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from</p>
<p>CAPT Rodney Lambert<br />RCC Leatherneck<br />FPO AE 09372<br /><br />Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award</p>
<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>EVALUATION STANDARDS</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD<br />1. This evaluation will be conducted using the procedures (as specified herein) from the procedures contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.1, specifically, FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection process shall be applied. Award will be based on LPTA proposals evaluated in order of lowest priced until an offer with acceptable technical capability is identified. Award will be made to the Offeror who is deemed responsible and responsive that reflects a complete understanding of the Request for Proposal and is judged to represent the best value to the Government based on selection of the technically acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to refrain from awarding to any contractor in the event that all Offerors progressing beyond the technically acceptable evaluation are determined to have offered pricing that is not considered realistic, reasonable, or complete. The best value is represented by the lowest priced technically acceptable offer. The factors and sub factors are the uniform baseline against which each offeror's proposal is compared to determine the confidence the government has that the Offeror will be able to satisfactorily accomplish all work required. They establish the level an Offeror's proposal must meet in any area, factor, sub factor, or element in order to be judged acceptable. To be eligible for award, a proposal must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and include all information required.</p>
<p>2. The process of selection will be the following: the Government will evaluate all price proposals first, and determine completeness with regard to price (price proposals will not be evaluated using DBA Insurance). After determination of completeness with regard to price, the Government will rank offerors from lowest price to highest price. Following this step, the Government will take the lowest price offeror with a complete price proposal and evaluate that offeror for technical acceptability. If that offeror is determined to be technically acceptable, the Government will select that offeror as the awardee. If the lowest-price offeror is determined to be technically unacceptable, the Government will evaluate the next lowest offeror's proposal, and will continue this process until an alternate lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal is identified. The Government will continue the aforementioned process until it has identified the lowest-priced, technically acceptable offer, plus an alternate technically acceptable proposal as back-up in case the awardee LPTA offer cannot accomplish the requirement. No award will be offered to an alternate LPTA Offeror unless the lowest priced Offeror rejects the offer to enter into a contract.</p>
<p>3. Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical or price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced or if any single unit price is considered unbalanced, as stipulated in FAR 15.404-1(g).</p>
<p>4. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements.</p>
<p>5. The following factors will be used for evaluation:<br />a. Technical Capability<br />b. Price<br />c. Past Performance</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL EVALUATION<br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation which will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost elements and whose proposal is from a responsible offeror, in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable source selection method. <br /><br />1. Technical capability of the offeror to meet the Government requirement. The following technical capability elements and standards will be considered in determining offeror information to be acceptable:</p>
<p>A) Equipment Configuration and Quality<br />STANDARD: All equipment is properly specified to meet the technical application and is of a quality that will provide sustained performance in the environmental conditions of southern Afghanistan<br />B) Personnel Experience<br />STANDARD: Project Manager and Maintenance Technician have sufficient experience as required in the SOW.</p>
<p>C.) Vsat Cabin<br />STANDARD: Cabin as proposed is configured as per the SOW and provides the necessary components to achieve the performance objectives as described in the SOW. The receiving units are sufficiently robust to meet the environmental rigors of southern Afghanistan and are sufficiently simple to operate that that they can be erected and maintained by military manpower who have completed the in-theatre training package.<br />D.) Delivery Capability<br />STANDARD: Offeror demonstrates an adequate understanding of the process to achieve the required delivery dates, including a feasible plan for logistics management <br />D.) Maintenance Responsiveness<br />STANDARD: Offeror demonstrates an adequate plan for timely response to maintenance calls as identified in the SOW and that technicians can be sufficiently well paced in order that they can respond within the timelines.</p>
<p><br />Offerors are hereby notified that their Volume I Technical Capabilities proposals MUST satisfy ALL of the above listed technical evaluation elements and associated standards of acceptability. Failure to satisfy any one, or combination of, or all of the above listed elements and standards will automatically render the entire Technical Capabilities proposal as "Unacceptable". The Technical Evaluation Team will rate the technical proposals according to the chart listed:</p>
<p>DEFINITION RATING<br />Meets or exceeds minimum standard requirements ACCEPTABLE<br />Fails to meet minimum standard requirements UNACCEPTABLE</p>
<p>PRICE</p>
<p>An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the schedule by the proposed unit price for each item number to confirm the extended amount for each. An offeror's price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness. Unrealistically high or low proposed costs/prices may be grounds for eliminating an offer from competition on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal. The price evaluation will document the offers total price, and determine its reasonableness and affordability. NOTE: DBA Insurance will not be evaluated as part of the pricing evaluation.</p>
<p><br />PAST PERFORMANCE<br />Contractor shall submit relevant experience providing satisfactory or above performance and similar service with similar scope of work. <br />(End)</p>
<p><br />DISPOSITION OF UNSUCCESSFUL PROPOSALS</p>
<p>In compliance with FAR subpart 4.8, the government will retain one copy of all unsuccessful proposals. Extra copies of such unsuccessful proposal will be destroyed by the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONFIDENTIALITY</p>
<p>All pricing information will be treated as confidential and is not releasable to others outside the process required to award a contract. This information will be used only for the purpose intended and under no circumstances will the information be given any other contractor without the written consent of the owner of the information or as is required by the Freedom of Information Act.<br />(END)</p>

QUOTATION EVALUATION: 

Evaluation Factors

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately of equal important to price. 

Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST’s requirements. NIST will give stronger preference to offerors whose quoted equipment includes any or all of the following: a back-illuminated sensor as described in specification 1; cooling below -90 C (absolute) as described in specification 2; a lens and mirror system as described in specification 4. 

Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror’s experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror’s past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.

Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness, in accordance with 52.217-5.  Price will be evaluated based on the cumulative total of all the line item prices.  

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor. 
Non-Governmental Acquisition Support 
The Government may utilize non-Governmental acquisition support for processing of quotations submitted in response to this solicitation. These individual(s) will have access to the quotation information and will be assisting the Contracting Officer in the procurement process by performing services including, but not limited to, preparing the quotations for submission to the technical evaluators, performing past performance checks, and preparing award documents.  The non-Governmental acquisition support will not conduct technical evaluations of any quotation and will not be involved in the final decision as to the awardee under this procurement.

   The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor.

As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers.

If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number.

   (e) Section III, Operation.

For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.
 
   (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section.
 
   (g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.
 
   (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.
 
   (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches.

     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

     (2) __ Outside the United States.

       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

 SECTION C - CONTRACT CLAUSES
 
 
 ADDENDUM to FAR 52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS
 
   Clauses that are incorporated by reference (by Citation Number, Title, and Date), have the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.
 
   The following clauses are incorporated into 52.212-4 as an addendum to this contract:
 
 C.1  VAAR 852.203-70 COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING (JAN 2008)
 
   The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor.
 
                              (End of Clause)
 
 
 C.2  VAAR 852.211-70  SERVICE DATA MANUALS (NOV 1984) ALTERNATE I (JAN 2008)
 
   (a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.
 
   (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.
 
   (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions.
 
   (d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).
 
   (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.
 
   (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section.
 
   (g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.
 
   (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.
 
   (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches.

                            (End of Clause)
 
 C.3  VAAR  852.246-70  GUARANTEE (JAN 2008)
 
     The contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of , said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor.
 
                            (End of Clause)

   (a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.

     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

     (2) __ Outside the United States.
 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.

All privatization projects will be supported by an economic analysis based on accepted life-cycle costing procedures that demonstrate the long-term economic benefit and reduced long-term costs. If the economic analysis determines that privatization is uneconomical, a contract will not be awarded, and proposal costs will not be paid. The resulting contract(s), if awarded, will require the Contractor(s) to furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation and any other incidental services for the complete ownership, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades and improvements to these utility systems.

The Contractor(s) proposal and plans may become a part of the contract upon decision to award. The Government anticipates awarding a Fixed-Price with Economic Price Adjustment Utility Services Contract(s) for a term of 50 years to the Best Value offeror(s). The ability to award individual systems to individual firms will exist. This requirement is unrestricted. All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered.

<DESC>Project P777 is for the Design/Build Wharf Charlie Improvements at Naval Station, Mayport, FL. This project constructs a steel sheet pile bulkhead and tie to existing cellular diaphragm wall structure, place self-hardening flowable fill between existing and new bulkhead, new concrete cap and partial concrete encasement of sheet pile, install new foam filled fenders and provide new asphalt paving. Project will demolish existing cold iron utility structures/connections/laterals back to mains, relocate fuel, water and sanitary utility mains so they are landward of the proposed new second deck, demolish concrete pile cap and fendering face, demolish concrete and asphalt wharf deck paving, remove timber fender piling.
 Install area lighting fixtures on anodized aluminum standards, reconstruct concrete cold iron utility igloos, piping, and wiring (electric, potable water, sanitary, oily waste, fuel, and steam) and install sacrificial cathodic protection system for the steel sheet piling and steel underground utility piping. This project contains one option to construct an elevated second deck with mooring hardware, vehicular access ramps, pedestrian stairways, concrete slab with beams supported by concrete columns, and deep foundations.

THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER: W912PL-10-P-0047<br><br>The purpose of this project is to conduct rare plant surveys of up to 350 abandoned mines targeted for closure and to adequately evaluate and document each site in compliance with this scope of work (SOW).  <BR><BR>Endemic rare plants may occur within numerous habitat types within the project area. Rare plant surveys are required to determine the presence and location of all rare plant species that occur on abandoned mine sites targeted for closure.   These surveys are necessary so rare plants can be protected during subsequent closure activities with a potential for ground disturbance.  A rare plant species is defined as any native vascular or non-vascular plant that, because of its biological characteristics or for some other reason, exists in low numbers or in very restricted areas in Nevada and is listed in the Nevada Natural Heritage Program's Nevada Rare Plant Atlas.<BR><BR>The Contractor shall perform all necessary travel, surveys, evaluations, documentation, reporting, and work required to complete the rare plant survey project as defined in this SOW.  <BR><BR>Tasks<BR><BR>Task 1: Rare Plant Surveys.  Rare plant surveys shall be performed at up to 350 mine sites located on federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  Due to the physical hazards and cultural significance of some of these sites, specific locations are not provided in this SOW but are available upon request.  Mine sites are located on, but not limited to, the following topographic quad sheets: Minerva Canyon, Badger Hole Spring, Ward Charcoal Ovens, Hogum, Comins Lake, Sacramento Pass, Windy Peak, South Bastian Springs, Ruth, Riepetown, East Ely, Duck Creek Valley, Lusetti Canyon, McGill, Kalamzoo Summit, Egon Canyon, Ward Mountain, Yerrington, Yerrington NE, Churchill Butte, Silver Springs South, Fourmile Canyon, Frenchman, Fourmile Flat, Parker Butte, Wabuska, Wadsworth, Olinghouse, and Pah Rah Mountain..     <BR><BR>Rare Plant Survey Protocol<BR><BR>The following summarizes the protocols for conducting rare plant surveys on BLM lands prior to a ground disturbing project. These guidelines provide step-by-step procedures to ensure accurate survey results and compliance with minimum standards for reporting these results.  These guidelines will enable the surveyor to identify target species and associated habitats.<BR><BR>Step 1)  Locate and map all populations of a rare plant species within the potential area of disturbance.<BR><BR>Step 2)  Locate all rare plants of a particular habitat.         	<BR><BR>Timing  <BR><BR>Conduct field inventories at the appropriate times of the year when the target species are present and identifiable.  Inventories should include all potential habitats that may be directly affected by the project.  Some species (particularly those in desert climates) have the ability to withstand drought stresses for extended periods by a long-lived seed bank.  However, It is assumed these surveys will be conducted during the optimal season(s) for identification and multiple site visits to the same mine site will not be necessary.  <BR>  <BR>Pre-field Review <BR><BR>Prior to conducting field inventories, the investigator should be familiar with the rare plants that are suspected to be present in the study area. If available, use a regional or local reference population to obtain a visual image of the target species and the associated habitat(s).  If access to reference population(s) is not available, investigators should study specimens from their local herbaria (USFWS 1996).   Other sources of information include floras, environmental impact reports and previously completed rare plant survey reports as well as informal reports such as status reports prepared by agency personnel and local checklists (Nelson 1985).  The Nevada Natural Heritage Program can provide species lists (and often photos) if requested.  <BR><BR>Field Survey <BR><BR>Presence-or-absence surveys will be conducted for listed rare plants.<BR><BR>The purpose of conducting presence-or-absence surveys is to determine impacts of potential land disturbance activities associated with project mine closure operations to rare plants listed in The Nevada Rare Plant Atlas. The project area is defined as any vegetated area that will be cleared or partially cleared, with vehicles on it, temporarily or permanently used for equipment or materials storage, or sites where soils/vegetation will be damaged, fragmented, or disturbed.  Established roads, pads, previously disturbed areas, and trails will be used as much as possible to avoid any impacts to soils and vegetation. <BR><BR>Presence-or-absence surveys will be conducted around the closure disturbance area using parallel, linear transects spaced a maximum of 30 feet apart through suitable habitat providing 100% coverage of areas that may be directly impacted by closure activities.  Surveys will be specifically concentrated on areas directly adjacent (within 30 feet) to mine site openings. In some locations, transects less than 30 feet wide may be appropriate. If the project area contains locations with vegetation or topography that obscures or reduces the surveyor's ability to view the ground surface when utilizing 30-foot wide transects, the transect width will be narrowed accordingly to achieve full line of sight. Vegetation community type information within the project area will be recorded.  If a population or site is found for a rare plant species of concern, the extent of the site will be documented. This may require surveys slightly outside of the footprint of the project area to accurately assess effects to the species from project implementation.  In general, the project area will be less than 0.5 acres.  In a few cases where overland travel is needed for access, the project area could be up to 1 acre.  GPS data of rare plant locations shall be provided in proper data format. <BR>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, NCA 8,  VA San Juan  Medical Center

Description of Action:  Request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of Integra Furniture.

Description of Supplies or Services:  Lounge and reception area furniture items.

2.	Statutory Authority:  
	(x)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		Agency Requirements;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		 or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  The requesting service has determined that all other furniture will hinder the standardization of the common area. Only the specified makes and models of furniture under Integra Furniture will satisfy the agencyâ€™s needs for additional units. Integra Furniture is the supplier of the furniture in place.  Other furniture not under the specified by service will not comply with the continuity of the design and chairs already installed in the common areas.


3.	Actions to Promote Competition:  Competition among same SIN 711-17 "multiple seating" within contract parties among GSA would be detrimental to the already standardized furniture in the common areas.  It was concluded to limit competition and apply FAR part 6.302-1(b) (4).

4.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $. 34,826.54.  Prices were verified within the Contractor's catalog.  Prices are fair market value.  

5.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  Survey conducted and other furniture in GSA under SIN 711-17 "multiple seating" will thwart integrity and standardization.

Other Considerations:  Nonetheless, Integra Furniture has a patented tube and structural system which no other can provide.  Moreover, it has a lifetime warranty which is essential due to the high usage this furniture will have in a common area.

6.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:  N/A

7.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition:  N/A.

8.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
