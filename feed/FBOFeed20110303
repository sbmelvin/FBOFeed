<DESC><p>Synopsis: <br />The 20 Contracting Squadron (CONS), Shaw Air Force Base SC, under authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, intends to negotiate solely with Alutiiq 3SC, LLC, 3909 Arctic Blvd, Ste 400, Anchorage AK, 99503, the incumbent contractor, to provide a purchase order to serve as a bridge contract between the existing Awards and Decorations contract-FA4803-10-P-0060 (which expires 27 March 2011) and a new Awards and Decorations Services Solicitation-FA4803-10-R-A021. This will allow the Government sufficient time to execute the award of a new contract for Awards and Decorations.<br />The mission of USAFCENT Unit Decoration Personnel Unit (UDPU) is to provide quality personnel to directly support field commanders, Air Force members, their families and retirees, during both peacetime and wartime, through the administration of an effective awards and decorations program. The UDPU serves as the focal point for all individual and unit award/decoration actions for all contingencies and deployments in direct support of operations: ENDURING FREEDOM, IRAQI FREEDOM, the HORN OF AFRICA, and any other Operations the COMUSCENTAF approves in the future. The disruption of this service would cause an immediate and negative impact on the mission of the USAFCENT Area of Responsibility (AOR). <br />The current contractor is providing the USAFCENT/UDPU with non-personal services which include: personnel, supervision, management, transportation, and materials necessary in operating the USAFCENT Awards and Decorations Processing Unit in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS) dated 1 July 2004. Due to the extensive lead time necessary to set a replacement contract in place, along with the significance of this requirement in fulfilling a critical segment of the USAFCENT mission, full and open competition cannot be provided for without causing a complete disruption of the USAFCENT Unit Decoration Personnel Unit services. <br />The Government proposes awarding a sole source purchase order to ensure the continuation of the Awards and Decorations Services until a follow-on five-year contract can be solicited, evaluated, and awarded. The Government anticipates the award of a five-year replacement firm-fixed price contract on or about 1 June 2011. <br />This document does not constitute a solicitation for offers. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Pricing data is not requested or required. No contract award will be made based on responses received. This synopsis shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. The MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA Ombudsman is:<br />Mr. Eric Thaxton<br />129 Andrews Street<br />Langley AFB, VA, 23665<br />Phone Number: 757-764-5372<br />FAX: 757-764-4400<br />Email: eric.thaxton@langley.af.mil <br />The Ombudsman hears and facilitates the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes, nor does the Ombudsman diminish the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. When approached with an issue or query the Ombudsman independently assesses the situation and provides a response or initiates a resolution, and when requested, will maintain confidentiality as to the source of the inquiry.</p>

<DESC>The contractor shall research, develop, assemble, test, install, and validate operation of an up to 1 MegaWatt (MW), state -of-the-art prototype photovoltaic (PV) system that uses thin film amorphous silicon technology incorporated in tandem junction solar PV cells at the base distribution requirements. In addition, the contractor shall design and incorporate the system such that power generated by the system will continue to supply power to the base in the event of a public utility power grid failure. During normal operations of the system and utility grid, all power generated by the system shall be monitored, measured and recorded. Therefore, the prototype PV system will provide power to the base and only to the base in the event of a public utility grid failure. This capability shall be of a highly reliable rugged design in which electric power, 365 days a year, twenty-four (24) hours a day will be supplied in an environmentally friendly manner. This shall be demonstrated over a time period To Be Determined (TBD) after the contract is awarded and is expected to be for up to 30 days of continuous operation. This prototype system is the first of an integrated secure autonomous base power design, using low cost amorphous solar cell technology, and is to be a "full scale test bed" that will provide the basis for testing and evaluating integrated low cost PV and supporting power integration technologies. It is anticipated that future renewable base power systems will incorporate technology developed and demonstrated by this program. It is anticipated that this effort may be expanded in the future to produce power greater than 1 MW or explore other alternative energy technologies. The capability of this prototype system to expand and incorporate electric storage technology and other forms of alternative energy is anticipated and should be considered in the design.

<DESC>This RFI is intended to identify interesed parties for the following: Please submit estimated costs and top level, best practice solution ideas.
<p>1.0 Objective</p>
<p>The objective of this ROM is to identify an Enterprise solution to consolidate all ACC telephone operator functions into two host call centers (East-Host Call Center and West-Host Call Center). This effort shall include analytical research required to produce an enterprise solution. Offeror shall provide all hardware, software, licensing and training required for the use of the system.</p>
<p>The host call centers will be used to remotely handle telephone calls for twelve bases divided between call centers. A key requirement for centralization within ACC is a completely redundant enterprise architecture model where each call center is fully backed-up by the other call center in a COOP fashion. We have identified Beale and Langley for perspective locations with Shaw being 2nd choice for east location and Offutt as 2nd choice for west location. However, we will rely on analytical research provided by the vendor to make final decision.</p>
<p>The offeror shall prepare each site to re-home operator assisted calls to their perspective call center, and shall provide all required hardware and software as required for the implied transition.</p>
<p>2.0 Program Requirement</p>
<p>ACC has twelve bases with independent telephone operator functions which are contractually provided. Operators are currently base centric and can only respond to incoming/outgoing calls for that particular base (i.e. no ability to share workload between bases). Due to Air Force restructuring missions, the government retains the right to remove any specific base from this task order.</p>
<p>2.1 Place of Performance <br />Beale AFB, CA<br />Langley AFB, VA</p>
<p>2.1.1. Today, most operator services at Air Force bases are provided 24 hours/7days a week. These services include: <br />&bull; directory services<br />&bull; operator assistance (information line)<br />&bull; base locator service <br />&bull; morale calls services supporting deployed and TDY personnel<br />&bull; conference calling (random and preset)<br />&bull; precedence calls and C2 support (initiated, unanswered, diverted, etc.) <br />&bull; Senior level support/local info<br />&bull; documenting, verifying, and maintaining required records<br />2.1.2. These services are decentralized, base-by-base controlled and operated. The goal is to improve system reliability and interoperability by implementing a common platform throughout ACC, reduce and/or eliminate telephone operator positions thereby reducing total cost of ownership, and improving maintainability by consolidating into two call centers within ACC-command.</p>
<p>3.0 Specific Task</p>
<p>The end-state is an automated product that meets the needs of ACC, while standardizing and consolidating the telephone switchboard operator processes and equipment used to provide operator services. The solution shall be incorporated and be interoperable with current Voice Switching System (VSS), Automatic Health and Morale System (AHAMS) and Telecommunications Management System (TMS) architectures, standards, and operating procedures. As we move to IP-based voice switches this solution must be capable of supporting IP interfaces.<br />3.1 System Certifications<br />The solution(s) shall be on the JITC certified approved product list. Products currently on JITC testing schedule will be considered. All equipment or system installations shall be at the latest JITC certified software version. <br />Offeror shall complete the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) for a Type accreditation that will be applied across ACC. All information will be loaded into EITDR to ensure an ATO/ATC is issued.<br />3.2 Database Integration and Sharing<br />The solution will integrate with other CITS network management tools and voice network management tools at the enterprise level. At a minimum, it shall be able to share database information with AHAMS, performance monitoring and alarms, security monitoring, and account management data with the CITS Network Management Systems, TMS and AHAMS. The system shall be open and flexible for quick, end-to-end implementation by integrating easily with third-party call center technologies, such as ACDs, CTI middleware, and enterprise resource planning systems, or other third-party applications and hardware.</p>
<p>3.3 Remote Access and Administration <br />The systems shall provide remote access to the system, database, and file structure for emergency maintenance and system upgrades through both a dedicated port and/or virtual port using remote user authentication as well as physical barriers allowing positive disconnect. Remote access will comply with AFI 33-111, Telephone Systems Management, attachment 7, the DSN Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG), and other security related guidance as deemed necessary by AFNIC/ECNV and the CITS PMO. Secure, remote access to all appliances must be allowed under a net-centric configuration/architecture.</p>
<p>3.4 Interface to Air Force Switching Systems<br />At a minimum, the solution must be able to process operator call data from all Air Force voice systems supporting telephone operator consoles and systems. This includes, but is not limited to, the Nortel MSL-100/CS-2100, Nortel Meridian 1, and Avaya S8700 voice systems. It is important that the solution selected is vendor independent to provide the Air Force more flexibility in major voice system acquisitions.</p>
<p>3.5 Optimized Service Delivery <br />The solution shall have knowledge management capabilities to allow telephone operators to apply known solutions, rapidly locate relevant information, and quickly handle service issues and requests. Also, it is desirable to be able to apply best practice methodologies to the service resolution process by providing dynamic scripting to intelligently guide interactions, activity templates to guarantee consistent adherence to established procedures, and graphical workflow modeling to enforce Air Force policies and procedures.</p>
<p>3.6 Global Updates in an Inter-Relational Database <br />Administrative updates will globally update all related records in all system components, to include multiple registrar systems as well as base-level appliances, while maintaining database integrity. Enterprise updates will be across the Air Force VPN using appropriate data encryption techniques. This is essential to NOSC-centric three-tier hierarchy management capability.</p>
<p>3.7 Online Help <br />Administrators and clients shall have online help functions and screens designed to assist base-level maintenance personnel and NOSC administrators with hardware and software application maintenance and system parameter definition. Online help screens will provide electronic documentation and user reference aids for user maintenance and configuration of system tools and database (data dictionary).</p>
<p>3.8 Training &amp; Documentation <br />System hardware and application training shall be both in-residence and exportable courseware (Computer Based Training). Also, any special training required for operators shall be identified and provided. The training shall be duty position specific and identified by core and non-core requirements. Documentation shall include all commercial manuals required to maintain the hardware and software platforms. Documentation may be either electronic or standard paper document manuals.</p>
<p>3.9 System Reliability <br />System reliability and maintainability standards will be equal to or better than related industry standards for similar Automated Information System platforms.</p>
<p>3.10 Fault Management and Error Notification <br />The system shall be able to detect applicable errors and equipment faults, determine origin, and provide for automated fault correction or an avenue for manual notification for technician response for corrective actions if automated actions cannot correct the error. System errors and equipment outages will provide for local and remote alarm notification and management activities. Notification of errors and outages will be via visual indication or automated electronic notification at both the local base as well as the remote administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.11 Metrics, Analytics, and Reporting <br />The system shall include system operations reporting metrics. The system shall have default system reporting tools as defined by common industry practices for like products for the most requested data associated with system use, operations, and administration. The system application will also allow user (administrator) definable reports based on the needs of the system administrators. This may include creation of reporting formats for specific users, base level reporting, MAJCOM, or AF-level.</p>
<p>The system shall provide insight and real-time visibility into call center trends. It shall provide the information and analytical tools required to review performance quickly using pre-built or ad hoc analytic reports. From a single, consolidated view, management can analyze performance metrics including resolution times or service levels, account, and agent team. The system shall provide instant visibility into automated logs of modifications to customer information according to customized auditing rules, service and performance metrics, equipment failure rates, operator productivity, and overall customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>4.0 Baseline<br />EFI&amp;T a JITC certified solution to build-out two host call centers (Beale AFB and Langley AFB) and re-home their perspective operator assisted calls. The offeror shall provide all required hardware and software as required for the implied transition and use of the system.</p>
<p>4.1. East - Host Call Center<br />Offeror shall provide analytical research to determine ideal location for the East Host Call Center. This location will provide live operator services to remote bases also determined from analytical research. Offeror shall estimate peak busy hour calls within the core traffic types identified in paragraph 2.1.1. Based off traffic studies, offeror shall estimate number of operators required in order to handle the projected peak traffic load within the current de-centralized or standalone base environments. Analytical data shall identify raw savings by reducing and/or eliminating operator positions, thus reducing total cost of ownership.</p>
<p>4.2. West - Host Call Center<br />Offeror shall provide analytical research to determine ideal location for the West Host Call Center. This location will provide live operator services to remote bases also determined from analytical research. Offeror shall estimate peak busy hour calls within the core traffic types identified in paragraph 2.1.1. Based off traffic studies, offeror shall estimate number of operators required in order to handle the projected peak traffic load within the current de-centralized or standalone base environments. Analytical data shall identify raw savings by reducing and/or eliminating operator positions, thus reducing total cost of ownership.</p>
<p>Note: Separate contract will be solicited to provide personnel to answer operator assisted calls at each call center.</p>

<a href="mailto:robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov">robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for an Information System Security (ISS) Independent Risk Assessment and Testing Software Tool.
This requirement includes providing an audit compliance software tool that will enable the FAA to perform Certification and Risk Assessment analysis of Air Traffic Organization (ATO) National Airspace System (NAS), Mission Support, and Administrative Systems to meet the requirements of Public Law 107-347 (Title III), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002.
During FY2010, the FAA ATO ISS Program procured a one-year license of ThreatGuard Secutor Prime Pro Gov and Magnus Client License Gold and Magnus Server License Gold Support Gov in order to perform Certification and Authorization of NAS assets to determine compliance with Office of Management and Budget mandated Federal Desktop Core Configurations (FDCC).  The FAA procured ThreatGuard Sector Prime because the Government believed that this tool was the only one that could provide the flexible interfacing techniques that could support the different test methodologies that are required which include host-load, USB access, and remote access.  The FAA has an immediate need to obtain a second one-year license of an audit compliance software tool that will aid in assessing and performing Risk Assessment and Compliance checks against FDCC requirements.
This market survey is being conducted in order to determine whether or not there are alternative sources of software audit compliance tools that will meet the FAA's requirements.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.   The NAICS code for this requirement is 541519, Other Computer Related Services with a small business size standard of $25M in average annual receipts.
This market survey shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these items.  The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the Market Survey, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement.
The interested vendor's response must be submitted no later than 2:00 P.M. local time on March 17, 2011.  Electronic submission is preferred.  The electronic submission should be in either Microsoft WORD format or portable document format (PDF).  Please note that the FAA e-mail server restricts file size to 10MB per email message, therefore, responses may have to be submitted in more than one e-mail in order to be received.  All responses to this Market Survey must be in writing and must demonstrate that the company can meet the requirements provided above.  Limit responses to no more than 10 pages and include a completed Business Declaration Form (Attached).  The Business Declaration Form does not count in the page count.   Submit any questions by email.  Submit responses by email or overnight delivery to:

<DESC>1.  Introduction/PurposeThe FAA has a requirement for Modernization of the Air Traffic open training program.  The FAA needs to provide lower-cost and more efficient methods to train Air Traffic Controllers and technicians.  FAA wants to find out what advanced technologies and learning technologies such as open standards, extensible markup language (XML), and content repositories can be easily implemented for web-based, virtual world, and voice recognition technology, are available to increase the efficiency of our controller and technical development programs for both new and recurrent training. The goal is to reduce the cost, increase proficiency- and performance-based training while improving instructor-to-student accessibility ratios. This will deliver increased performance and proficiency during all phases of training, provide virtual remote access.  It will also provide students with technical feedback on their simulation performance.  Any application should be easy to modify by the agency.  The technologies and tools will be applied to the following areas of training: 	Air traffic control, basic radar air traffic techniques such as acquiring targets, vectoring, separating aircraft by altitude and distance, identifying aircraft characteristics and impact to operations, transferring communications, effect of weather on the air traffic environment, new equipment training repair, and inter- and intra-facility coordination.  	Technical operations alignment and improving any aspect in the entire spectrum of air traffic practical training will be considered.  The lessons/scenarios should be scalable to different levels of complexity and be easily tailored to specific air traffic facilities and airspace.  	Scenario-based outcomes that must, at a minimum, comply with standards established by Air Traffic Control, to include minimum separation, radio procedures and phraseology, wake turbulence application, and other restrictions.  The FAA is looking for sources that can use e-learning, e-coaching, collaborative development, and interactive simulations to increase the efficiency of our air traffic training programs at both terminal and en route work sites.  The following tools and applications are included in this search:	Methods for creating a curriculum architecture that allows for competency traceability to job tasks and training to measurable proficiency. This would support a framework for the structure and planning of training for the technical workforce that will bring together job task analysis data, curricula, and instructional guidelines.	A front end job and task analysis tool and database that tracks training content to specific job tasks and objectives.  This tool should have the ability to integrate with a training content management system to facilitate the creation and maintenance of training content that is aligned with tasks and objectives.	Leased bundled services at a defined annual fee that provide web-based training content authoring and management, automatic software maintenance, support, and upgrades, customization and integration services, and unlimited licensing for developers and learners.  The learning content management system should meet all of the previously defined requirements of the stakeholder community.  2.  Incumbent Contractor (Not applicable)

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.
<p>Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure the brand name Applied Biosystems BigDye Terminator Reagent, 5,000 reactions manufactured by Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Dr., Foster City, CA 94404.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard in 500.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Delivery: 1 week after receipt of purchase order</p>
<p>The goal of the Laboratory of Translational Genomics is to dissect the genetic basis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) validated in large scale, genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This approach will identify new regions to be studied in great detail and eventually applied to large molecular epidemiology studies to estimate the magnitude of the effect.</p>
<p>To accomplish this goal, thousands of patient DNA samples are sequenced each year to identify common gene variants, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This genotyping is done using a well-established, high-throughput sequencing platform that utilizes BigDye&reg; Terminator version 3.1 (BDT) cycle sequencing chemistry.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide one TF,BDT v3.1 RR-5000 &amp; SEQ BUFFER</p>
<p>Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>1. Statutory authority:</p>
<p><br />Statute: This acquisition is conducted under the authority of section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</p>
<p>No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.</p>
<p><br />In order to continue the laboratory's mission of validating genetic variants that have been found to be associated with increased risk for certain cancers in GWAS, NCI needs to purchase more cycle sequencing reagents.</p>
<p>BDT has been used for over nine years in the laboratory to provide high-accuracy base assignments for comparative sequencing applications, namely SNP identification. NCI receives various types of DNA extracts from all over the world that require sequencing, so it is imperative that NCI's sequencing chemistry performs well on a wide range of template types and qualities. The Applied Biosystems BDT accomplishes this, and it also tackles complex, repetitive sequence patterns that the lab often sees.<br /><br />In addition to the above reasons, BDT chemistry from Applied Biosystems is unique because it is compatible with NCI's existing genotyping platform, a 3730xl DNA Analyzer from Applied Biosystems, along with the data collection and analysis software.</p>
<p>The salient characteristics that apply to the BigDye Terminator reagent are:</p>
<p>&bull; The reagent must be a ready reaction mix containing dye terminators, deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), Taq DNA polymerase, magnesium chloride and reaction buffer for quality control.<br />&bull; The reagent is required to be compatible with our current sequencing platform, 3730xl DNA Analyzer from Applied Biosystems.<br />&bull; The dyes in the reagent must be compatible with "Sequence Analysis Software version 5.2".<br />&bull; The dyes in the reagent must be compatible with "Data Collection Software" version 3.0.<br />&bull; The reagent needs to be formulated to generate long reads, as opposed to short, rapid read sequences.<br />&bull; The reagent must be flexible enough to perform well a variety of templates including PCR products, plasmids and large insert clones.<br />&bull; The reagent must not require an ethanol precipitation step to sequence plasmids.<br />&bull; The reagent is required to be robust enough to perform well with difficult templates such as those with dinucleotide repeats and other challenging sequence motifs.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on March 17, 2011. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Ward, Contract Specialist, atwardmr@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-110041-MW on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>FedBiz Synopsis for T64 Kit Procurement
<p><br />The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Contracts Department, Patuxent River, MD in support of NAVAIR 4.4, Propulsion and Power, intends to negotiate a delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-10-G-0007 on a sole source basis with General Electric, 1000 Western Ave, Lynn, MA 01902 for material and parts (770 kits) to upgrade the T64 Electrical Overspeed Switch mounting brackets. The Electrical Overspeed Switch is mounted on two brackets bolted to the forward and aft side of the front frame to compressor flange. The current brackets when mated with the new overspeed switch, P/N 4148T19P04, introduced in ECP 64N-13 create an interference with the airframe oil tank bracket on the CH and MH 53E aircraft. The interference is the result of a larger footprint of the new overspeed switch. The introduction of the new angle brackets eliminates the interference with the airframe oil tank bracket. Introduction of the proposed brackets does not affect adjacent configuration at the number one or three engine positions. The Government intends to procure under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. General Electric is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the only contractor with the requisite knowledge and experience of the current T64 Overspeed system. The estimated period of performance for this acquisition is 12 months. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS; however, responsible interested parties may submit information in which they can identify interest and capability to respond to this requirement. Responses must be received by 17:00 PM Eastern Time on 17 March 2011. The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is: 336412-Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Manufacturing. The Government reserves the right to process the procurement on a sole source basis based upon the responses received. The Government will not pay for any information received. The point of contact is T. C. Renner Jr., Contract Specialist, via E-mail: thomas.c.renner@navy.mil or by fax at (301) 757-9046.</p>

<DESC>This is a presolicitation notice only.

This competitive procurement is a 100% small business set-aside exclusively reserved for the participation of Small Business Concerns, only.  It is a source selection procurement requiring both technical and price proposals.  This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award multiple IDIQ-type contracts for engineering services.

The primary NAICS Code is 541513 and the corresponding size standard is $25M.  The contractor shall provide labor, material, and equipment to perform field support work for the following:

a.	Load installation geospatial, real property and explosives data into the ESS software for DoD installations.  Work with data owners to identify and resolve discrepancies between the GIS, RPI and explosives data sets and verify that the installation data is ready for use performing automated  explosives safety site planning.
c.	Convert data from other GIS software applications (e.g.
 AutoCAD, Autodesk Map, MicroStation, etc) into the proper formats (ESRI shapefile or geodatabase) and coordinate systems required for ESS use.  
d.	Create geo-referenced ESRI shapefiles or ESRI geodatabase from digitization of imagery, aerial photography, hard-copy maps and scanned maps.  
e.	Train DoD users in the automated explosives safety site planning process.  
f.	Provide Help Desk support to users of the ESS software.  
g.	Provide explosives safety site planning support using ESS to DoD installations.  

The performance requirements are tailored for each project, and will be outlined in the PWS for that task order.
The basis for awards is to the Offerors whose proposals, while conforming to the RFP and considering both price and technical factors, provide the best value to the Government.
  The technical and sub-technical evaluation factors are anticipated to be Factor I  Sample or Seed Task, Technical ability and plan to accomplish the work; Factor II  Technical Capability, (a) Performance Execution Plan, (b) Corporate Experience, (c) Key Personnel; Factor 3  Past Performance.  Factor II  Technical Capability is more important than all evaluation factors and when combined all evaluation factors are more important than cost or price. 
 
Offerors are required to submit separate technical and price proposals for the project.  Price proposals will consist of direct labor effort pricing (Hours and Base Labor Dollars) of the initial project, which may be a sample or seed project provided by the Government.
The period of performance for any resultant contracts will be a twelve-month base period plus Four (4) one-year option periods for a total of 60 months.
  The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $4,800,000.  Task orders will range from $5,000 and $300,000 and will be competed among the contract awardees.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the Government through issuance of a task order.

The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee under the performance period of the contract.  Contracts are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  There are no additional minimum guarantees obligated for each option year.

It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or about fifteen days from the date of this notice.
  The solicitation will be available in electronic format only.  The RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov on or about fifteen days from the date of this notice.  No hard copies will be provided.  It is the contractors responsibility to check the websites daily for any amendments to this solicitation.  

Offerors are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov.  Failure to register in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.
  

The information being requested does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract or to pay for any costs incurred as a result in replying to this notice.  This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.

The U.S. Environmental protection Agency (US EPA), Region 4-Atlanta, has a requirement for the extension of Bulk Argon and Nitrogen Gas Lines in accordance with the following Statement of Work:
SCOPE OF WORK for Extension of Bulk Argon and Nitrogen Gas LinesSummaryLines from our current argon and nitrogen bulk gas service in corridor SC-2 need to be extended to laboratory E114.  Nitrogen lines only need to be extended to laboratories E106, E109, and D111.  The lines will cross a fire wall near corridor SC-2.  Lines to E114 shall be medical grade stainless steel.  Lines to E106, E109, and D111 may be either medical grade stainless steel or pre-cleaned Type L copper.  Piping ends shall be covered while awaiting installation to prevent debris and contamination from entering the lines.  All joints shall be compression fittings.  No soldered or brazed joints are allowed.  All work must be done to local code specification and any commonly accepted industry standards.  Work must be done with minimal disturbance to laboratory operations currently using these gas supply lines.Laboratory E106New nitrogen gas lines need to be installed in the lab for four pieces of equipment.  This laboratory is approximately 200 feet from the existing gas line in SC-2.  Drop down lines for each piece of equipment requires a regulator and cutoff valve.  The regulators must be single-stage, single gauge, high purity regulators with stainless steel diaphragms (no neoprene).  Brass or nickel plated regulator bodies are allowed.  Equipment requirements follow.N-EVAP:  5 to 30 psi with 20 to 36 L/min flow rate. ASE 200:  100 to 200 psi with 1 to 2 L/min flow rate.ASE 350:  140 to 200 psi with 1 to 2 L/min flow rate.J2 Preplinc:  20 to 100 psi with 4 to 8 L/min flow rate.Laboratory E109New nitrogen gas lines need to be installed in the lab for three pieces of equipment.  This laboratory is approximately 160 feet from the existing gas line in SC-2.  Drop down lines for each piece of equipment requires a regulator and cutoff valve.  The regulators must be single-stage, single gauge, high purity regulators with stainless steel diaphragms (no neoprene).  Brass or nickel plated regulator bodies are allowed.  Equipment requirements follow.TurboVapLV:  60 to 100 psi with 85 to 142 L/min flow rate.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><strong><br />NAICS:</strong> 541611 <br /><strong><br /></strong>
<p><strong>CLASSIFICATION CODE:</strong> R - Professional, administrative, and management support services</p>
<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> Pre-Solicitation Notice for the procurement of a performance-based Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, as defined at FAR 37.6, to support the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Information Technology (US-VISIT) Program, primarily the Program Management Division.</p>
<p><strong>PLACE OF CONTRACT PERFORMANCE:</strong> The primary contract area is the Washington D.C. metro area. The successful contractor will be required to have or establish an office in the Washington D.C. metro area. The secondary contract area is the rest of the United States and all land, air, seaports, ferry crossings and railroads - nationally and internationally and any other area that is determined to be mission related.&nbsp;<br /><strong><br />DESCRIPTION:</strong> This procurement will result in a performance-based Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for program/project management and internal logistics support services for the US-VISIT Program. US-VISIT is responsible for collecting, maintaining, and sharing information through biometric identification and analysis services for homeland security decision makers. The successful firm will be tasked with accomplishing non-inherently governmental scopes to fulfill requirements that will assist US-VISIT in accomplishing their mission. The performance characteristics of this IDIQ will be unique to the implementation of various initiatives required by US-VISIT.</p>
<p>The specific services required by the contractor are dependent on the requirements of task orders. The contractor shall perform at least 50% of the work with its own forces. The contractor shall be able to continuously handle multiple complex, high-profile, projects of various sizes in multiple locations at any given time. The contractor shall be able to respond rapidly on an emergency as-needed basis throughout the contiguous United States.</p>
<p>The successful firm will provide services to support to the US-VISIT Program. That support may include the planning and execution of services related to the needs of US-VISIT including, but not limited to professional management and execution of US-VISIT program activities, pre-planning, strategic program planning, consulting, budget and schedule development, inspection and oversight services, environmental/LEED related services, design review and management, cost estimating, cost/price analysis, technical analysis, project and program scope development, construction management, development and maintenance of electronic databases, database support, Information Technology support, GIS services, modeling, master facility planning, building management, conference/meeting room management, technical writing, internal communication, records management, continuity of operations and emergency management, internal policy and procedures, FOIA management, business operations management, and asset management. Work associated with the task orders anticipated under the proposed IDIQ contract will require the respective firm to have the capability of assigning such disciplines as program managers, project managers, planners, schedulers, programmers, architects, engineers, inspectors, cost estimators, specifications writers, environmental specialists, historic preservationists, GIS specialists, modelers, budget analysts, database developers, graphics developers, public affairs specialists, records management specialists, asset managers, and administrative assistants as needed for support of programs and projects, including possible on-site services at federally owned and operated buildings or facilities. The successful firm will not perform design or actual construction work.</p>
<p>This contract is intended to support the mission objectives of the US-VISIT program. In the instance that the US-VISIT program is restructured or re-organized within DHS, this contract shall continue to support those mission objectives as the Government deems appropriate, and as approved by the contracting officer.</p>
<p>For this procurement we will be evaluating technical proposals in addition to price. Technical factors, when combined, will be significantly more important than price. The technical evaluation process will consist of a written technical proposal addressing the following evaluation factors - Experience and Past Performance, Management and Technical Approach, Qualifications of Key Personnel, and Subcontracting Plan/Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization Plan. If a competitive range is established the Government may hold oral presentations/interviews.</p>
<p>The contract period of performance will be one base year with four one-year options to be exercised at the discretion of the Government. The proposed contract will have a maximum ordering limitation (MOL) of $10 million per year for a total maximum amount of $50 million over five years. The balance of any unused MOL from each period may be carried forward to the next option year at the discretion of the Government. Therefore, each of the four option years' MOL may exceed $10 million. Each option year's MOL will be identified when the option is exercised.</p>
<p>Anticipated date for solicitation release is 15 days after the publication of this pre-solicitation notice. A pre-proposal conference will be held in Washington D.C. approximately 10 days after the solicitation is issued. Proposals will be due approximately 30 days after the solicitation is issued. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process. The services will consist of site planning, engineering studies, conceptual design, final design, cost estimating, and construction phase services for projects. The primary purpose of these contracts are to provide services for projects located within the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District. Secondarily, the contracts may be used to provide services within the geographic boundaries of the other U.S. Army Corps of Engineers districts within the South Atlantic Division. The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District. North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts. These contracts are set-aside for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and small businesses only. It is the intent of the Government to initially award one (1) service-disabled veteran-owned small business and one (1) small business contract. However, if there are no highly qualified service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms, then both awards will be made from the highly qualified small business firms. No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation. Only firms considered highly qualified will be awarded a contract. Indefinite delivery contracts will be negotiated and awarded from this solicitation with subsequent work issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders. This announcement will result in up to two (2) awards. Criteria used in allocating task orders among contracts include performance and quality of deliverables under current task orders, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, specialized experience, equitable distribution of the work among the contractors, and other relevant factors. The contracts will be for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for four additional years; not to exceed a total of five years. While the estimated dollar amount per year is $1,000,000.00, the actual obligation per year may be greater than or less than the $1,000,000.00. Maximum order limit is $5,000,000 for the life of the contract, including options. All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense. For more information, visit the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />BPA to Obtain Temporary Services of Subject Matter Experts and other Support for FNS Research and Evaluation Initiatives<br />Part I: General Information</p>
<p>The Office of Research and Analysis (ORA) conducts evaluations, program analyses and performance assessments that inform policymaking and management of Federal nutrition assistance programs. ORA's staff comprises recognized experts in a wide range of disciplines: evaluation, policy analysis, nutrition, sociology, economics, statistics, and social psychology. Working together, they bring these skills and knowledge to bear on the practical problems of directing and managing the nation's nutrition assistance programs. In addition, ORA provides timely analysis and evaluation of key policy and program issues for Congress, policy-makers and the public, and works to coordinate the Agency's strategic and operational planning processes.<br />ORA's ongoing program of research and evaluation on domestic anti-hunger and nutrition support programs has been expanding significantly and ORA needs temporary services of subject matter experts to support on an "as needed" basis the work of the official government Contracting Officer's Representatives (CORs) as they develop and manage the technical aspects of research, evaluation and analysis contracts and grants. <br />FNS anticipates entering into a BPA with one or more firms that can supply subject matter experts on a Task Order basis in response to requests from FNS for an expert or experts to work on specific time-limited assignments. FNS anticipates that the duration of the BPA will be 2 years with 3 options to extend duration an additional 1 year each (total of 5 years if all options exercised). The duration of each Task Order will be specified in the Task Order.<br />Task Orders will relate to specific assignments for one or more subject matter experts (SMEs). These Task Orders:<br />&bull;Will vary and may include one or more (i.e., a combination) of the examples in Table 1.<br />&bull;May range in calendar duration from several days through 24+ months.<br />&bull;May range in level of effort from 3 person-days of effort through 2 person-years of effort. <br />&bull;May require a few days of effort clustered in a short period of time, several groups of days disbursed throughout the lifecycle of a project, or continuous effort over a period specified in a Task Order.<br />&bull;May involve limited travel, usually to FNS headquarters in Alexandria, VA or meetings in the Washington DC metropolitan area.<br />&bull;May involve participation in meetings either in-person or by teleconference, or both.<br />&bull;May require confidentiality. Some Task Order assignments (such as participation in or providing advice to technical review panels and reviewing unpublished manuscripts) will require that the contractor and the selected experts maintain confidentiality about the work. <br />&bull;May require secure handling of sensitive but unclassified (SBU) paper and/or electronic documents.<br />&bull; May involve the need to determine actual or potential conflicts of interest. Some Task Order assignments (such as those related to procurement) will require that the selected experts be free from prior, current or anticipated conflicts of interest and avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts of interest, as required by law and regulations of individuals involved in Federal procurement decisions.<br />&bull;May vary in start time. Some Task Orders assignments may need to have an expert start work within a few days; others may have longer lead times.<br />Overview of BPA Responsibilities<br />1.The contractor shall identify and recruit SMEs screened for professional reputation (overall quality of expertise), independence from contract research firms typically funded by FNS and from advocacy groups that regularly comment on FNS programs and policies.</p>
<p>2.The contractor shall manage all administrative aspects of making SMEs available to FNS, invoice FNS for work performed by SMEs on Task Orders and pay the SMEs according to the procedures required by the SME's regular employer or other arrangements specific to the individual SME.</p>
<p>3.Following issuance of a Task Order calling for work by SMEs under this BPA, the contractor shall:<br />a.For each SME needed, recommend to FNS at least 3 SMEs that could perform the work. <br />b.Screen or re-screen the recommended subject matter experts for conflict of interest issues related to the specific work on the Task Order.<br />c.Screen or re-screen the recommended subject matter experts for availability during the time period(s) specified in the Task Order.<br />d.If FNS chooses to proceed, FNS will select one or more SMEs from the recommended list. Contractor shall then recruit a subject matter expert from among those that FNS has determined are suitable and obtain a signed commitment to perform the needed services, including formal agreements or sub-contracts with the expert or their employer, as needed.<br />e.Deliver the services of the SME to FNS as specified in the Task Order.<br />f.Pay selected experts and/or their employer as agreed (including reimbursement for travel or other necessary and approved expenses) and handle any other special requirements of an expert's employer.<br />g.If, at any point after committing to a specific SME, the contracted SME becomes unable to perform some or all of the work specified in the Task Order in a timely manner, repeat the steps above as needed to deliver the work called for by the Task Order in a timely manner.</p>

<DESC>This is not a solicitation, but a survey to locate potential sources capable of performing the work described in this notice. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC" or "Commission") is contemplating initiation of the first stage of its Advanced Research Technology Initiatives ("ARTI"), as discussed below.<br /><br />Congress formed the CFTC as an independent regulatory agency to protect market users and the public from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices in connection with the offer and sale of commodity futures and option contracts and to foster open, competitive, and financially sound commodity futures and option markets. In recent years, futures and options trading has expanded rapidly into many new markets beyond the traditional domains of physical and agricultural commodities. Trading facilities now offer futures and option contracts on a vast array of instruments, including single stock, environmental, performance measures, foreign currencies, U.S. and foreign government securities, and U.S. and foreign stock indices. Additionally, trading facilities have filed a significant number of new product applications and certifications, many quite innovative, covering a broad range of commodity types. The proliferation of electronic trading and new products has caused trading facilities to collect and use more data in the trading and trade clearing processes. Over a billion futures and option contracts have been traded annually on domestic trading facilities in recent years. Electronic trading is responsible for a major percentage of the overall market volume and that percentage continues to increase dramatically.<br /><br />Futures and options trading provide participants with a means for managing or assuming price change risks and for discovering prices or disseminating pricing information. To safeguard the integrity of futures and options markets, the CFTC seeks to maintain trading in liquid, fair, and financially secure trading facilities by, among other things, deterring and preventing price manipulation and other disruptions to market integrity and by protecting market participants from fraudulent activity that could lead to potential market manipulations. Due to the dramatic increase of trading volume in the commodity futures market and the emergence of algorithmic computerized trading strategies as well as high frequency trading platforms, the Commission desires to broaden its technical resources for the oversight and regulation of these markets. CFTC seeks to acquire the means for detecting and analyzing market anomalies caused by computerized trading based on algorithms that execute large numbers of transactions in a very short period of time (e.g., thousands of transactions per second).<br /><br />The Commission continues to make significant progress in updating its technology, data handling capabilities, and baseline analytical tools. To continue the improvement of its capabilities, CFTC has identified the following five areas where it is seeking outside assistance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Analysis of large trader reporting system data (e.g., end of day positions);<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Analysis of transaction level data (e.g., trades, orders, bids/asks);<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Analysis of unstructured data (e.g., news feeds, contract market specifications);<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Application of market surveillance intelligence solutions; and<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Development of Trader Networks showing basic network properties as well as advanced structural statistics.<br /><br />CFTC requires contractor support in developing and implementing a new class of Market Oversight Projects that utilize algorithmic anomaly detection and high capacity information technology resources (e.g., high-speed supercomputing capability for large data volumes and time intensive analysis).<br /><br />The contractor(s) will also be responsible for providing (through in-house development or other means), implementing and testing specific algorithms for identifying possible systemic risk in financial markets. These algorithms will assist in market manipulation detection scenarios (i.e., models) based on the various data received on a daily basis from the exchanges and market participants. In addition to market manipulation detection scenarios, the contractor(s) will be responsible for developing, implementing, and testing algorithms in other CFTC business areas such as market compliance, economic research and analysis, and enforcement actions. These additional algorithms may require the contractor(s) to assist in data integration services that will incorporate various enterprise-wide data sources such as large trader end-day positions, daily market activity, indices, daily order information, trader account information, and third party data sources. The contractor(s) may be required to conduct further analysis and investigation which may require sophisticated queries, detailed and summary reports, data-mining activities, trend-analysis and statistical analysis.<br /><br />Data, such as large trader end-of-day positions, market data, order data, and trade data may be provided by the CFTC or directly from other sources (both commercial and non-commercial). The contactor(s) will be required to follow strict security guidelines when handling data related to ARTI. Furthermore, data hosted by contractor systems will require direct access from CFTC personnel, either onsite or through a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN). The contractor(s) will be required to provide data processing and analytical results to the CFTC through secure File Transfer Protocol (FTP) in order for CFTC staff to further analyze algorithm outcomes.<br /><br />CFTC is seeking one or more sources that possess the following capabilities:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Using its (i.e., the contractor's own) technology resources, perform robust data analysis by incorporating various data abstractions and algorithms into a single anomaly detection method, which could be applied to structured data (e.g., orders and trade data) and unstructured data (e.g., emails). This also includes supporting multidimensional data mining for more explanatory power (e.g., uncovering new latent information and revealing subtle relationships).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Ability to conduct predictive analysis techniques and methods to forecast and quantify potential adverse risk in the Futures Markets. This may include a combination of regression analysis, diffusion dynamics in networks, and sensor placement strategies in various networks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Ability to perform data analysis and anomaly detection techniques that are data agnostic (i.e., will work with any sort of reference data) and use a system of dynamic clustering.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Ability to utilize a system of simulation technologies that use agent-based modeling, which could be applied to the Futures Market for testing out various regulatory scenarios as well as reconstructing markets for playback and investigative purposes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Ability to prototype and test process high-frequency data for complex analysis.<br /><br />CFTC encourages sources that possess one or more of the five capabilities identified above to respond to this notice. Information furnished should demonstrate experience relevant to the proposed project and capabilities listed above, and should include:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. A description of the number and professional qualifications of scientists, engineers, technical and other appropriate personnel;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Corporate experiences related to the proposed project;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. A description of general and special facilities, including technological capabilities of the contractor; and<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Other literature which demonstrates the capabilities listed above.<br /><br />Respondents are not required to have performed work for, or related to, financial regulators or any of the financial markets to be considered qualified to perform the anticipated project. CFTC is seeking sources that possess the identified capabilities from both a technological and human capital standpoint to perform the data analysis tasks described in this notice.<br /><br />This synopsis is for information and planning purposes, and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted. Based upon responses received, the Government reserves the right to set aside any and all procurements that may result hereunder for small or minority-owned businesses. If the evaluation of responses received concludes that none of the respondents have any of the necessary capabilities, CFTC may elect to task one or more Federally Funded Research and Development Centers to perform the work, pursuant to FAR 35.017. All responses are due by April 14, 2011 at 3:00 p.m. local (Washington, DC) time, and shall be submitted via email to the Contracting Officer identified in this notice.

Truckee-Carson Irrigation District will be responsible for developing engineered drawings for the proposed structure which meet all current Bureau of Reclamation guidelines, and for obtaining the US Fish and Wildlife and  Bureau of Reclamation's approval before commencing construction under the terms of the MOA.  Upon completion the structure will be considered a facility of the Newlands Reclamation Project under the Bureau of Reclamation's jurisdiction, and will be maintained by the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District under its contract with Bureau of Reclamation for operation and maintenance of Project facilities.
This announcement is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals to complete any phase of the proposed work.  The US Fish and Wildlife Service intends to enter into negotiations within 5 days and award of contract is anticipated within 15 days of the posting date of this notice.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to award sole source contract modification.  The National Park Service, North Cascades National Park Service Complex, Sedro-Woolley, Washington,  intends to award a sole source modification to Wesslen Construction of Spokane, Washington valued at $27,716 for additional within scope work.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and is announced for the purpose of compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, the justification follows:
1. Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity: Department of Interior, National Park Service, North Cascades National Park, 810 State Route 20, Sedro-Woolley, Wa 98284.
2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: Modification of contract C9471101055 for additional within scope work.
3.  A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value: Modification, additional within scope work at North Cascades National Park, Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, Stehekin Dock Project; added work includes; 1) installing a bubble curtain around steel piles greater than 10 inches in diameter as a sound attenuation method during pile driving with an impact hammer below the ordinary high water line, and 2) exchanging hydraulic fluid in equipment used for this project with biodegradable fluids certified as non-toxic to aquatic organisms. Net increase $27,716 (original award $982,703).
4. An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: COTI 1443.06-01, as amended, DIAPR 2008-10 and FAR 6.3
5. A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: This was a competitive project that was properly synopsized and awarded. Wesslen Construction was selected as the Best Value in accordance with the solicitation requirements and Federal Acquisition Regulations. At time of solicitation & award, some required permits were still outstanding. Once permits were received (post award), additional mitigation provisions were required by the Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It would not be practical to try and obtain a competitive award to do a small part of the work of a major construction project.  Stehekin, Washington is also one of the most remote locations in the lower 48 states, contractor access to Stehekin is via a 55 mile long barge trip or float plane.   
6.

7. A Determination By the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable: Pricing for the additional work has been reviewed by the Program Manager and the Contracting Officer, documentation is on file.
8. A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market Research was conducted for the original contract. This added work is directly related to the original scope of work, it would not be practical to try and obtain a second contractor to do a small part of the additional work required.
9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (see FAR 6.302-2 (9) (i) - (iii) for some examples): N/A
10.  A Listing of the Sources, If Any, That Expressed in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: N/A
11.  A Statement of the Actions, If Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome    Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required:  Environmental requirements were reviewed by Program Personnel before the solicitation phase and all anticipated mitigation requirements were included. The additional mandates were not anticipated.
12.  Certification:   I certify that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (i.e. verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate: Signed certifications on file at NOCA procurement office.  
Questions related to this notice should be submitted in writing and directed to Barry Fetzer, Contracting Officer, North Cascades National Park Service Complex, 810 State Route 20, Sedro-Woolley, Wa 98284

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to issue a limited sources award for Clinical Information Systems Essentris Sustainment Support to CliniComp International, Inc. Services include software and hardware sustainment, technical and customer support, proactive automated system monitoring and alerting, repair service, replacement parts, software updates, and configuration assistance.  This requirement will also provide a range of customer support services at both the MTF and program office level. The Period of Performance for this effort will be one (1) eight-month base year with three (3) twelve-month option periods, as well as a three (3) month optional transition out period. Currently, CliniComp International supports the MHS Clinical Information Systems Sustainment Support through it's Essentris Software.  CliniComp is the only contractor that can provide proprietary services and equipment for the Essentris system, due to the fact that CliniComp has not licensed the resale right to maintain the Essentris software to any other contractors.  <BR><BR>Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability as outlined below Limited Sources Justification are invited to submit written notification to the Contract Specialist NLT 17 March 2011 at 12PM EST. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firm's ability to provide the stated capability. Information should be sent electronically to Charles Bartlett, Contract Specialist, at charles.bartlett@amedd.army.mil. No telephone requests will be accepted. Responses received will be evaluated; however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the limited sources contract.<BR><BR>Limited Source Justification: Approval is being requested for a new contract based for MHS requirements for Clinical Information Systems Essentris Sustainment Support.   This will be a sole source contract with CliniComp International. Reason for Authority Cited:  From FAR 8.405-6.   Market research indicates other companies' similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's needs.  This action requires the use of the authority cited because the proposed contractor, CliniComp International, is the only contractor that can provide proprietary services and equipment for the Essentris system, due to the fact that CliniComp has not licensed the resale right to maintain the Essentris software to any other contractors.  The Military Health System's (MHS) inpatient documentation solution, CIS, is a comprehensive clinical documentation system for use in acute care hospitals.  Under the terms of its standard commercial license, the developer of Essentris, CliniComp, retained the data rights to the Clinical Information Systems (CIS) source code. Access to the source code is necessary to accomplish the maintenance services and DoD Information Technology Security and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) services covered by the contract.  In addition, CliniComp's source code is cutting edge and propriety; therefore it is unlikely that any other vendor would be able to understand and maintain the system.  These items, software, training, and documentation are due to reconfiguration of Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) where the product has been in use.  The new supplies/service/software need to have the same working relationship as the currently deployed system. Consequently, during the period covered by this contract, only CliniComp International can provide full-service support and equipment for CIS.  Thus, the Contractor is uniquely qualified for fulfilling the contract requirements.  Essentris, a COTS product, is a mission-critical comprehensive clinical documentation system for use in Services' treatment facilities since 1988.  The system is currently deployed in Air Force, Navy and Army CIS sites.  As a deployed application, Essentris has been deployed to and is in sustainment mode at 59 Tri-Service sites.  Procurement/development of an alternative system would be cost prohibitive to the Government.  In addition, there would be costly delays in implementation of an alternative system whereas the Government would need to provide two concurrent systems for an upspecified period of time to allow CIS sustainment as well to allow for an alternative system to meet integration and CIACAP certification. As previously stated, CliniComp is the only contractor that can provide proprietary services and equipment for the Essentris system, due to the fact that CliniComp has not licensed the resale right to maintain the Essentris software to any other contractors.  CliniComp has certified that: (a) CliniComp has not granted any third party maintenance and support contractor any license or right to use or access the proprietary Essentris source code for any purpose or use, including, without limitation, for engineering development of software update changes necessary to correct software problems, produce software enhancements or implement critical IA security software changes; (b) CliniComp does not permit any third party access to the dedicated DoD maintenance and support enclave at CliniComp's headquarters nor has it granted others the right to use any of the GFE located in the enclave, which is required to be maintained to comply with requirements for the Essentris Approval to Operate certificate pursuant to DIACAP; (c) does not make available to any third party CliniComp's proprietary maintenance and software needed for the continuous monitoring and maintenance of the Essentris Systems and (d) CliniComp has not licensed or granted to any third party any other right to provide maintenance and support services for the proprietary Essentris software or data acquisition system. <BR><BR>Due to all of the above stated reasons, the Government would be burdened with an unreasonable amount of cost and schedule risks.  To mitigate these risks/costs, the Government intends to sustain the current Essentris system rather than procure a new/alternative Clinical Information System at this time.  <BR><BR>

6.  Monitoring Notification.

IRS management retains the right to monitor both the content and the level of access of contractor employees_ use of IRS IT systems.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. 

_Registered in the CCR database_ means that_ 

(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and 

(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record _Active_. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. 

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. 

(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation _DUNS_ or _DUNS +4_ followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror_s name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. 

(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. 

(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number_ 

(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or 

(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. 

(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: 

(i) Company legal business. 

(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. 

(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and ZIP Code. 

(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and ZIP Code (if separate from physical).

(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. 

(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. 

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government_s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 

(g) 

(1) 

(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, _doing business as_ name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day_s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor_s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the _Suspension of payment_ paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. 

                                                            (End of clause)

 Section I
  

I.1 52.232-33 PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER--CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)  


     (a) Method of payment. 
          (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer. 
          (2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either- 
               (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or 
               (ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause). 
     (b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database. 
     (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210. 
     (d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
     (e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 
          (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for- 
               (i) Making a correct payment; 
               (ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and 
               (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. 
          (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and- 
               (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or 
               (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. 
     (f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. 
      (g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. 
     (h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent. 
     (i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database. 
                                                              (End of clause)

<SUBJECT>Development of a Clinically-Useful Classification of Mental Disorders for Global Primary Care
<SOLNBR>2006695
<RESPDATE>031011
<CONTACT>Susan Nsangou, Phone 3014432104, Email nsangous@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland for the support of developmental activities required to implement systematic program of the international and multilingual formative and evaluative field studies as part of the development of ICD-11 classification of mental and behavioral disorders.
<p>The project will develop a clinically useful classification of mental disorders for global primary care. It will determine: (1) How disorder categories should be organized to inform decisions about the overall architecture of the classification system by examining the relationship of possible structures to clinicians' conceptualizations of mental disorders and their clinical management; (2) Which disorders, conditions, or problems should be included in a diagnostic system to facilitate appropriate identification and treatment of mental and behavioral disorders at each level of care-mental health specialty, primary care, or RDoC-related research; and (3) How information for each disorder should be presented.<br />Based on clinical utility as an overarching priority, formative field studies will address three broad questions:</p>
<p>1. How should the structure or architecture of disorder categories be organized in order to maximize clinical utility in different settings?<br />2. What categories should be included in a diagnostic system at each level of care in order to facilitate appropriate identification and treatment of mental and behavioral disorders?<br />3. How should the information for each disorder be presented in order to most useful to its intended users (e.g., prototypes, diagnostic guidelines)?<br />Information from these field studies will be used as one important source of information in making decisions about the structure, content, and presentation of the ICD-11 classification of mental and behavioral disorders, both in a version for mental health specialists and in primary care.</p>
<p>Following the development of the draft classification, evaluative field study protocols will be developed and implemented. Some of these may be analog studies (e.g., using clinical vignettes), but others will be implemented in international clinical settings using patient assessments in order to test clinical utility and other implementation parameters (e.g., reliability, cross-cultural applicability).</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has unique capabilities to perform this contract due to: <br /><br />1)access to an essential dataset necessary to complete the project; 2) significant first-hand experience in analyzing these data; 3) the necessary scientific and technical expertise</p>
<p>a. Access to WHO International Classification of Diseases Version10 (WHO ICD-10) and Related Development Sites<br />The core activities of the proposed project involve development of a clinically useful classification of mental disorders for global primary care within the WHO ICD-10. Access to WHO ICD-10 is essential for performance of this contract. The WHO ICD-10 is not publicly available and cannot be accessed by 3rd parties.</p>
<p>b. Need to establish international field study centers to accomplish the work. The World Health Organization has established, expressly for this proposal, several international field study centers in low-, middle-, and high-income countries under the leadership of investigators who have a record of productive research and international collaboration focused on the diagnosis of mental and behavioral disorders.</p>
<p>c. No other source has comparable capability. The WHO has developed ten versions of its ICD over many decades at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. <br />Initiative represents an investment of several decades and hundreds of millions of dollars, and it is estimated that any attempt at duplication of the WHO ICD would cost at least this much.</p>
<p>The WHO ICD-10 is a proprietary classification system for mental disorders.<br /><br />d. Special Qualifications and Experience of the World Health Organization<br /><br />As an organization, WHO is uniquely capable of and suited for conducting the work described. WHO's constitutionally mandated functions, endorsed by 193 member countries, explicitly include the development and revision of international nomenclatures of diseases and the standardization of diagnostic procedures. WHO is the only organization with the ability to secure global cooperation and international agreement on health issues and is therefore in a unique position to initiate and promote global health standards, through its direct relationships with Ministries and Departments of Health in all its member countries. Consistent with WHO's charter to advance international public good, the ICD is a free and open resource for the global community, functioning as a tool for practitioners, researchers, consumers, administrators, and policy makers as they work to understand and communicate about diseases and to plan, finance, and evaluate health care.</p>
<p>There are enormous advantages to conducting this program of work within the context of the ICD revision. Decisions that are incorporated into the ICD-11 will have immediate, broad, and lasting global impact. Moreover, implementing this program focused on mental disorders alongside the rest of the ICD revision will facilitate the search for related mechanisms of etiology, pathophysiology, and comorbidity of disease processes and providing a solid basis for the parity of psychopathology with the rest of the medical system for clinical, administrative, and financial functions in health care. WHO is in a unique position to clarify boundaries and overlap and to consider alternative distributions of diagnostic entities among disease areas. Questions of structure and architecture can be considered more broadly because they do not represent professional turf issues. The clearest example is the relationship of mental disorders diagnostic categories and criteria to those for neurological diseases, which has direct bearing on issues of central importance to RDoC. The fact that the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse has responsibility for both the ICD chapter on Mental and Behavioural Disorders and the chapter on Diseases of the Nervous System will support a thoughtful and clinically useful approach to the integration of mind and brain, and help to enhance the congruence of the next international classification for mental disorders with the perspectives and finding of RDoC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a constitutionally mandated function of WHO, the ICD revision receives considerable attention and support from the organization as a whole. The proposed project will be a core activity of the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse. Additional information regarding the programs, project, and publications of the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse can be found at http://www.who.int/mental_health/en/. The WHO Mental Health and Substance Abuse Department has relationships with leading scientists throughout the world and an international network of Collaborating Centers with the capacity and commitment to work with the department on research and public health projects. The department's projects tend to be highly cost-effective because experts and governments are often willing to contribute large amounts of in-kind support.</p>
<p>Operational responsibility for the revision of the ICD-10 mental and behavioural disorders classification is located within the department's Programme on Evidence, Research and Action on Mental and Brain Disorders. The objectives of the Programme include: 1) To collect, compile and disseminate information on mental health systems; 2) To develop evidence for mental health action including in emergencies; 3) To develop guidance for prevention and management of mental and neurological disorders, including among children and adolescents; and 4) To contribute to diagnosis, classification and burden estimation of mental and brain disorders. Additional information regarding the Programme on Mental Health Evidence and Research is available at http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/en/.</p>
<p>The period of performance is 12 months with the option of two additional 12-month period(s.) The place of performance is primarily Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Therefore based on the aforementioned facts, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements FAR 6.302-1. The Government intends to select and evaluate and award the offer that represents the best value to the Government, price and all other factors considered. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 12 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI2006695 may be submitted to the NIDA, SS/SA Branch, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892, Attention: Susan A. Nsangou, Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of the Director (OD) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences (OBSSR) intend to procure professional services on a sole source basis from Health Services Research Journal, a flagship publication of the Health Research and Educational Trust to publish a special issue on "Methodological Considerations for Measuring Health Care Disparities." The period of performance shall be from date of award through 9/30/2011.
<p>Objective:<br />The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) furthers the mission of NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavior and social factors play in health, health care, well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of policies, goals and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research. OBSSR's vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSR's plan includes facilitating: a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social sciences research: b) transdisciplinary "team science" that brings together the biomedical, behavioral, and social-ecological perspectives; c) research that integrates the systems and multiple levels of analysis; d) the translation, implementation, dissemination, and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the sciences of dissemination, put what is known into widespread practice, reduce the burden of chronic disease and help eliminate inequities in health and health care.</p>
<p>OBSSR proposes to support and fund the development of a special issue of Health Services Research (HSR). The overall goal of the special journal issue is to focus on challenges in the measurement of racial/ethnic disparities in health care and innovative approaches for addressing these challenges to help move the field forward.</p>
<p>Background Information: <br />Racial and ethnic disparities persist in the United States in many areas of health care (Institute Of Medicine [IOM], 2002; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2009), despite numerous private and public efforts to reduce these disparities. Soon after the IOM Report Unequal Treatment (IOM, 2002) systematically documented disparities in multiple segments of the health care system, Congress mandated tracking disparities through the annual National Healthcare Disparities Report produced by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, with an emphasis on trends in disparities across health care sectors. While numerous studies assess racial and ethnic disparities in health care and sessions on the topic are among the best attended at national health policy and public health conferences, there is urgency in the field to move beyond documenting disparities to identifying new strategies for reducing disparities. Advances in measurement and methodological approaches used in disparities research are needed to realize this goal. There are numerous methodological challenges related to identifying racial/ethnic disparities, tracking them over time, understanding underlying mechanisms leading to disparities, and evaluating the effects of policies to reduce disparities. While innovative techniques have been developed, widespread use and further development of cutting edge methods have been hampered by a lack of transdisciplinary collaboration and communication about emerging approaches.</p>
<p>A special issue of HSR dedicated to challenges in the measurement of racial/ethnic disparities in health care and innovative approaches for addressing these challenges would help move the field forward. Specifically, the special issue would provide an overview of the methodological issues inherent in measuring, tracking, and identifying disparity reducing initiatives, and present considerations of and possible solutions to these complex problems of measurement with input from multiple disciplines.</p>
<p>The set of proposed papers reflect work begun at a conference "Methodological and Conceptual Issues in the Measurement of Healthcare Disparities" convened in February 2010 by the Advanced NIMH Disparities Center of the Center for Multicultural Mental Health Research (Margarita Alegria, PI) at Cambridge Health Alliance, and the Harvard Catalyst Health Disparities Research Program (John Ayanian, Director). This conference included presentations and transdisicplinary dialogue among researchers who approach racial/ethnic disparities from multiple lenses, including sociology, health services research, economics, medicine, statistics, geography, and public health. Building on this conference, the special issue of HSR would address various measurement and methodological challenges in disparities research from diverse disciplinary perspectives as a resource for health services and disparities researchers, students, and policymakers. <br />The overarching themes of this special issue will be to: <br />1) Present and discuss measurement challenges in research on mechanisms of health care disparities from diverse disciplinary perspectives; <br />2) Disseminate recent innovations in disparities measurement and methods; and <br />3) Provide guidance to health services researchers on measurement and tracking of health care disparities in diverse contexts.</p>
<p>Purpose of the Agreement: <br />The purpose of this agreement is to provide support for the planning and production of a Special Issue on Methodological Considerations for Measuring Health Care Disparities in the Health Services Research (HSR) journal. This agreement provides funding to support the staff time of the publisher in planning and preparation activities for the special issue. This includes staff time for planning activities to include solicitation of authors, coordination and preparation of journal layout and content, and support for ongoing planning and editorial management meetings. All activities will occur in consultation with the Editors of the special issue. All funds will be transferred directly to HSR for the stated purpose.<br /><br />Below is a summary of the papers proposed for this special issue: <br />I. Measuring "Race" in Disparities Research <br />A. Accuracy of Race/Ethnicity Data - Alan Zaslavsky, PhD (HMS), Professor of Health Care Policy, John Ayanian, MD, MPP (HMS), Professor of Medicine <br />Research on patterns of health and health care that uses Medicare data often relies on racial/ethnic identification in Medicare enrollment files. Previous research (Arday et al., 2000) showed that racial/ethnic identification was fairly reliable for Blacks and Whites but not for other groups, but has not been updated to reflect improvements in CMS data over the last 10 years. Using a very large database (over 600,000 responses) from recent CAHPS surveys of Medicare beneficiaries, we compared self-identification (using the 1997 OMB standard) to CMS enrollment database data. We find that identification of Hispanics continues to have low sensitivity. Furthermore the Hispanics identified in CMS databases differ in age, geographical distribution, and significant characteristics of health and in health care experiences from Hispanics not so identified. Thus while the former represent a group of interest in disparities studies they cannot be considered representative of all Hispanics. Similar issues apply for Asian-Americans.</p>
<p>B. Race, Geographical Ancestry, and Disparities in Disease Risk: Measurement Error - Alexandra Shields, PhD (MGH), Assistant Professor of Medicine <br />As genomics research continues to advance, more information about the prevalence of genotypes that affect individual risk of developing a disease or response to treatment across "populations" is being generated. Some have argued that genetic differences across groups may account for a substantial portion of racial/ethnic disparities in disease prevalence and clinical outcomes. The measurement of "race" in health services research has been a longstanding methodological concern; the use of racial categories in genomics research is far more complex and controversial. This paper addresses problematic issues of measurement in the literature on "racial" differences in risk of disease or response to treatment based on allele frequency differences across "populations," and discusses the implications of these methodological issues for future health disparities research.</p>
<p>II. Measuring Health Care Disparities <br />A. Implementing the IOM Definition of Healthcare Disparities to Identify, Track, and Understand Mechanisms of Disparities: A Guide for Health Services Researchers -<br />Benjamin Cook, PhD (CHA), Instructor in Psychiatry; Margarita Alegria, PhD (CHA, HMS), Professor of Psychology; Thomas McGuire, PhD (HMS), Professor of Health Care Economics; Alan Zaslavsky, PhD (HMS), Professor of Health Care Policy <br />Numerous definitions and methods have been proposed and used to measure disparities. These authors propose an IOM method of disparities and there has been some uptake of the use of these methods. However, while there has been diffusion of these methods, the widespread use of IOM-concordant methods has not been realized. The authors present a guide to implementing disparities methods in two contexts: 1) implementing the IOM definition of disparities to identify and track health care disparities over time (rank and replace, propensity score, and reduced models); and 2) identifying and understanding underlying mechanisms that are driving disparities (decomposition techniques and mediation analyses). The authors present best practices for each context, and weigh the pros and cons of alternative methods.</p>
<p>B. Rethinking Disparity Measure: Assessing the Role of Causality in Disparities Estimation - Xiao-Li Meng, PhD (HU), Whipple V. N. Jones Professor of Statistics, Harvard University; Julia Lin (CHA); Margarita Alegria, PhD (CHA), Professor of Psychology; Naihua Duan, PhD (CU &amp; NYSPI), Professor of Biostatistics <br />Much of the literature on measuring disparity emphasizes the need to making a fair assessment. For example, in assessing health care disparities across racial groups, adjustment is needed for existing differences in clinical needs. Whereas the rationale for such fairness considerations is clear, it is much less clear how to actually carry out an adjustment that substantiates the fairness as intended, instead of providing an apparent "equality" based on meaningless or even misleading adjustments. The very common practice of creating a counterfactual population by simply making a minority population's variables for adjustments (e.g., clinical needs) to have the same distribution as that from a reference population (e.g., White), while holding everything else unchanged, suffers exactly that problem because it effectively ignores the natural dependence between the variables to be adjusted and those not to be adjusted (e.g., nativity). Summarizing the findings in Duan, Meng, Lin, Chen, and Alegria (Statistics in Medicine, 2008, 3941-56) and more recent work, this paper demonstrates the danger of such misguided adjustments and the need to consider causal relationships among adjustable and non-adjustable variables in order to construct counterfactual populations that can substantiate the fairness as intended.</p>
<p>C. International Comparison of Methodologies used in Disparities Research - Jason Beckfield, PhD (HU) Assistant Professor of Sociology; Sigrun Olafsdottir, PhD (BU) Assistant Professor of Sociology, Harvard University <br />Cross-national comparative research on health disparities has been hampered by a number of methodological challenges, including a lack of comparable data on health care systems, health disparities, and socioeconomic position. This paper reviews the motivations for comparative research on health and healthcare disparities, and discusses recent advances in the measurement and modeling of social inequalities in health and healthcare across different countries. The threats to causal inference that are common in comparative research will be reviewed, and recent comparative research will be discussed, with the aim of advancing new lines of inquiry that place disparities in a comparative context.</p>
<p>III. Approaches to Gain New Insight into the Mechanisms Leading to Health Care Disparities <br />A. Neighborhood Context, Social Determinants - Jennifer Haas, MD, MPH (BWH), Associate Professor of Medicine, David Williams, PhD, MPH (HSPH), Florence and Laura Norman Professor of Public Health, Kellee White, PhD, MPH, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Arnold School of Public Health, The University of South Carolina</p>
<p>Increasingly, there is substantial interest in the documentation of the role of place in shaping the delivery of health care. Recent evidence demonstrates that the quality, accessibility, availability, and affordability of healthcare resources often reflect the geographic distribution of race/ethnicity or income in a neighborhood. However, emerging complexities in measurement and analysis have implications for understanding, interpreting, and addressing inequities. In this article, we critically evaluate the relation between health care disparities and neighborhood contextual factors. With a particular emphasis on racial/ethnic residential segregation, the authors will summarize the extant empirical research and highlight key measurement and methodological challenges. Suggestions for future research directions and the implication for policy solutions and interventions will be discussed</p>
<p>B. Jointly Addressing Race/Ethnicity and Socioeconomic Status in Health Disparities Research: <br />The Case of Lung Cancer - David R. Williams, PhD, MPH (HSPH), Florence and Laura Norman Professor of Public Health, K. Vish Viswanath, PhD (HSPH), Associate Professor of Society, Human Development and Health, and other researchers from the Lung Cancer Disparities Center <br />This paper will describe a framework for understanding and addressing the joint contribution of SES and race/ethnicity to disparities along the continuum of lung cancer. It emphasizes the importance of multiple vulnerabilities and the need to examine how racial/ethnic status combines additively and interactively with SES and other social statuses to facilitate or restrict exposure and response to risk factors and resources relevant for lung cancer. We show how this approach can provide a clearer picture of the contribution of SES to disparities across the continuum of lung cancer and facilitate assessment of how much of the observed racial/ethnic disparities in lung cancer are due to SES. It will also shed light on the dynamic and interdependent processes that are operative when race and SES combine to affect patterns of risks and resources and privilege and disadvantage that can affect health risks across different social contexts. In addition, this approach can facilitate the delineation of the factors that contribute to any residual effect of race and enhance our ability to identify clear targets/avenues for effective intervention. We will show how studying race/ethnicity and SES differences together, in lung cancer and health status and heath service use more generally, can begin to facilitate the identification of the potential avenues of improving overall population health that apply to all groups, and the conditions under which race/ethnic targeted interventions are indicated. Efforts to understand and effectively address disparities in health status and improve overall population health must target both socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities.</p>
<p>C. CBPR - LeRoi Hicks, MD, MPH (BWH), Assistant Professor of Medicine, Denise De Las Nueces, MD (BWH), Clinical Fellow in Medicine <br />This paper will review all available clinical trials incorporating CBPR methodology since 2003. Its goals are to assess published descriptions of the extent of community involvement, rates of successful participant recruitment of minority populations, types of interventions assessed via CBPR and success in changing clinical or behavioral outcomes. <br />D. Vignettes in Ethnic/Racial Health Disparities Research - Alexander Green, MD, MPH (MGH), Assistant Professor of Medicine, Sheri Lapatin (CHA), Ligia Chavez (UPR), Marta Gonzalves (CHA); John Ayanian, MD, MPP (HMS), Professor of Medicine; Margarita Alegria, PhD (CHA); <br />This paper will address vignettes as a useful and appropriate methodology to tackle questions of healthcare disparities. It will explore the particular utility of vignette methodology, in that they easily allow alteration of specific aspects of a vignette case subject (i.e., race/ethnicity or gender) and thereby make it possible to explore difference in judgments according to these aspects by clinicians or patients. The paper will also shine a light on implicit bias as a controversial issue, and explore question of the validity of vignettes as a good predictor of individual action.</p>
<p>E. Disparities in Mental Health Services: Results from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiological Survey - Margarita Alegria, PhD (CHA), Professor of Psychology, Julia Lin (CHA); Chih-nan Chen, Research Associate, Center for Multicultural Mental Health Research; Naihua Duan, PhD (CU &amp; NYSPI), Professor of Biostatistics, Colombia University; and Xiao-Li Meng, PhD (HU), Whipple V. N. Jones Professor of Statistics, Harvard University</p>
<p>In this study we estimate the extent of mental health service disparities using innovative methods to adjust for differences between African Americans/ Latinos and non-Latino Whites in mental and physical health status. We also explore the role of sociostructural, contextual, and health system factors as potential mechanisms of mental health service disparities. These findings can be used to target resources, develop coherent public policies, and inform guidelines aimed at making mental health prevention and treatment services more responsive and sensitive to the needs of ethnic/racial minorities. The NLAAS, NCS-R, and NSAL samples were developed using integrated methodology as part of the NIMH Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys allowing us to pool the three data sets for all reported analyses. Our findings suggest that when we adjust the minorities to have the same level of mental health clinical needs as the non-Latino whites given their SES status, we see that African Americans use significantly less services than non-Latino whites (28% versus 38% respectively) and Latinos use services at a comparable rate (39%) as non-Latino whites. We proceed to evaluate how insurance, education, and geography can help explain the disparity. Our results suggest that different interventions will need to be implemented for the different minority groups to eradicate service disparities</p>

Volume I - Offerors are to submit a Technical Proposal which must include the contractor's technical capability to perform the work as specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Proposals shall include how each requirement is intended to be met and the capabilities the contractor has to meet these requirements. Proposals are to include, but not limited to, the type of Material Handling Equipment the company has performed maintenance and repairs on; the qualifications of the proposed personnel who are to work on the Material Handling Equipment; the type of Material Handling Equipment the proposed personnel have experience working on and the nature of the work completed on the equipment; how the company is going to perform Emergency service within the 24 hour timeframe and meet all required schedules; the ability to obtain parts and materials for the variety of maintenance/repairs to be performed on the Material Handling Equipment and the relationships the company has with vendors to obtain the necessary parts for the different Material Handling Equipment.

Offerors shall submit the following information as part of their proposal for both the offeror and proposed major subcontractors (if applicable). List performance data on three (3) most recently completed or current Federal government contracts (not to have exceeded 3 years since completion) for relevant contracts. If offerors do not have three Federal contracts, State, local or commercial contracts can be used to complete this requirement. Attachment (3) Past Performance Evaluation Data sheet shall be completed by the offeror in its entirety for each contract. Attachment (4) Past Performance Evaluation Form. The offeror shall send out and track completion of the Present/Past Performance Evaluation Form to each of the offeror's relevant past performance contracts Point of Contacts (POCs).

The offeror shall exert its best efforts to ensure that at least one POC, per relevant contract, submits a completed Past Performance Evaluation Form directly to the Government no later than 5 days after the solicitation closes. Each offeror's POC shall fax or email its completed Past Performance Questionnaire directly to: Mr. Patrick Smith. The completed questionnaire must either be emailed to: patrick.w.smith2 @navy.mil or faxed to 732-323-2359, Attention: Patrick Smith, call 732-323-7754 prior to close of the solicitation. Failure to submit the data sheet, with the proposal, shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for relevant contracts of similar size and scope. In conducting this assessment, the government reserves the right to use both data provided by the offeror, including contacting any Points of Contact listed, and data obtained from other sources. The Contract Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) will be utilized to validate past performance. Offerors should provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and any corrective actions taken. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is incorporated by reference. Addendum 52.212-2 Paragraph (a): Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors. The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate proposals: 1) Technical Capability, and 2) Past Performance. Proposals shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated. Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors. Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a "pass/fail" basis. If a proposal has been determined to be a "pass" on Factor 1 then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror's past performance history is satisfactory. An offeror who has submitted an acceptable proposal under Factor 1 and who has been found to have satisfactory or neutral (in the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available) past performance under Factor 2 will then have its proposal evaluated for the lowest price. Factor 1- Technical Capability, To be acceptable, the offeror must provide at a minimum: 1) Specific information (experience, qualifications, background, etc) that demonstrates the capability of the personnel to accomplish the work in the PWS. 2) The offeror's technical proposal shall follow the paragraph-by-paragraph order of the PWS in or to show that each requirement is met or exceeded beginning with section C.4 thru section C.22 of the PWS. Information to be provided by the offeror must support the claims to meeting the requirements specified in the PWS. Factor 2-Past Performance: Proposals determined to have passed the technical capability requirements will then be evaluated for acceptable past performance history. Any offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable proposal and who has been found to have a satisfactory or neutral record of past performance will then have its proposal evaluated for the lowest price. Proposals shall be evaluated for acceptability (only) on a pass/fail basis and will not be rated. Offerors will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports. Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. It will not be based upon absolute standards of acceptable performance. The Government will seek to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely services. If no performance record has been identified, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably and will receive a neutral rating. All offerors must provide the past performance information requested or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience. The Government will consider the relevancy of the past performance data. To be considered relevant, the offeror must demonstrate past execution of similar contracts in terms of complexity, technology, magnitude of effort, schedule, and scope. Additionally, the performance must have occurred during the last three (3) years. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance relevancy. Price: If a proposal has been determined acceptable under each of the non-price factor listed above, the Government will then evaluate the proposal for the lowest price. The price proposal will be evaluated to determine the offerors prices are realistic, accurate, and reasonable. The total evaluated price will contain the price for the base period plus all option years and all CLINs.</p>
<p>Proposals which are unrealistic in terms of technical or schedule commitments or unrealistically high or low in cost may be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence, or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed work, and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal. Subjective judgment on the part of the Government evaluators is implicit in the entire process. The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, if considered necessary by the Contracting Officer, discussions will be conducted with only those offerors determined necessary to ensure efficient competition. Options: The Government will evaluate offers for award proposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items and DFARs 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer.

<DESC>FLENUMMETOCCEN has used Platform's software for several years, and has found it to be both robust and reliable in allowing very large NWP jobs to be run on multiple nodes simultaneously.  Platform MPI is both IA and DoN approved, and listed in DADMS and EAF for use at FLENUMMETOCCEN.  FLENUMMETOCCEN does not have the resources to maintain two different versions of the same software; in fact, the Navy FAM routinely denies requests to have multiple pieces of software that perform the same function.  Finally, all of the existing components of the A2 supercomputer suite use this software;  a heterogeneous environment is less likely to met the rigorous mission up-time and availability requirements.
   While the source of this software is neither specified nor required, this Brand Name Justification makes explicit the requirement that same type of software currently installed (Platform MPI) must be the software that is bought.

<p>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition<br />Under 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)<br />Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy<br />Agency Requirements</p>
<p>Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by FAR 6.3 and in accordance with the requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR 6.3 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR6.303-2 as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Agency and Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>U.S. Coast Guard, Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), LRS Contract Section, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, proposes to issue a purchase order on a basis other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>Approval is requested for a sole-source, requirements contract, for the repair of the Engine Instrument Display System (EIDS) components used on the HC-130H aircraft.</p>
<p>This system is manufactured by Innovative Solutions and Support (IS&amp;S) of Exton, PA. The initial purchase was procured using full and open competition. A prototype was developed and then tested and approved by USCG Engineering. Subsequent approval of the prototype allowed installation of this system on all HC-130H aircraft. This requirement is to establish a repair contact for the Engine Data Concentrator Unit P/N: 9B-84052-4, 10 inch Flat panel Display P/N: 9D-84051-7, and the Display Control Panel P/N: 9B-05284-3.</p>
<p>The proposed contract type is a firm-fixed price requirements contract and the vendor is Innovative Solutions and Support (IS&amp;S) of 720 Pennsylvania Drive, Exton, PA 19341.</p>
<p>(3) Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>As the Aviation Inventory Control Point (AICP), ALC must provide effective supply support for all Coast Guard aviation units and for the Programmed Depot Maintenance Program. Overhauls and repairs are part of this requirement. This requirement is for the repair for the EIDS components. Repairs could be provided for by individual purchase order, but to reduce the administrative burden and increase the repair turn around time, a five year firm-fixed price contract would be more advantages to the Government. This requirement is to be awarded to the OEM. The repair services and estimated quantities are based on current and future material requirements.</p>
<p>Period <br />Base Year 12 mo. $43,883.00<br />Option Year 1 12 mo. $45,638.32<br />Option Year 2 12 mo. $47,463.85<br />Option year 3 12 mo. $49,362.41<br />Option Year4 12 mo. $51,336.90<br />Total: $237,684.48</p>
<p>(4) Identification of the justification and rationale.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled "Only one responsible source or a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition require use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>This system is manufactured by Innovative Solutions and Support (IS&amp;S) of Exton, PA. The initial purchase was procured using full and open competition and the price was determined fair and reasonable. A prototype was developed, tested, and approved by USCG Engineering. Subsequent approval of the prototype allowed installation of this system on all HC-130H aircraft. This requirement is to establish a repair contact for the Engine Data Concentrator Unit P/N: 9B-84052-4, 10 inch Flat panel Display P/N: 9D-84051-7, and the Display Control Panel P/N: 9B-05284-3.</p>
<p>In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. IS&amp;S holds the proprietary rights for the technical data and drawing required to effect repairs to this material. No other vendor is authorized by IS&amp;S to effect repairs to this material. The USCG does not have the required data or drawings to overcome the sole source barrier to competition. It would not be cost effective to acquire the data to satisfy full and open competition.</p>
<p>"Only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".</p>
<p>(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.2, a Sources Sought Notice was posted on FedBizOps on November 17, 2010 for a fifteen day period.</p>
<p>A web search was conducted using ILS Mart which is a web based parts locator service used by ALC to identify industry venders, both for new buys and repair sources. A complete search using ILS Mart identified no repair sources were available for this material.</p>
<p>A General web search was conducted using the internet. The part numbers and NSNs along with the item descriptions were searched. No information was available for this material using a general web based search.</p>
<p>(7) Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>It is the Contracting Officer's opinion that price ultimately negotiated for this procurement will be determined fair and reasonable based on comparison with historical AMMIS pricing and pricing identified in FEDLOG.</p>
<p>(8) Description of the market research.</p>
<p>When conducting market research, the Coast Guard's Aviation Maintenance Management Information System (AMMIS) is checked. This is a database that provides historical data for all parts purchased by ALC. This database includes, but is not limited to, part number, nomenclature, purchase/delivery order number and historical pricing data. As part of the requirements package, a copy of all AMMIS data is included to support the independent Government estimate. Federal Logistics (FEDLOG) is a federally supported program which lists all manufacturers/suppliers by cage code. This program provides a valuable tool for supplier information and is utilized by requirements personnel to determine if alternate sources of supply exist. Information is accessed by National Stock Number, Nomenclature, item name, supplier name, and cage code. In this case no repair sources were identified. ILS Mart is a website used to locate hard to find parts and repair venders capable of repairing industry components. No sources were identified using ILS Mart. A Source Sought Notice was posted on FedBizOps seeking repair source for this material. Only the OEM responded to this posting.</p>
<p>Market surveys are continually conducted to identify new sources of supply for the HC-130H components and spare parts. If there are any changes to the market research during this contract period that will benefit the government, than appropriate steps will be taken to recomplete this effort.</p>
<p>Based on the market research performed, only one source and one source only are capable of fulfilling this requirement. The OEM has stated that they are the only authorized source for repair due to proprietary technical data rights. No other source can satisfy this requirement.</p>
<p>(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.<br /><br />This requirement is for the repair of proprietary components of the engine instrument display system. Initially on 9/29/06, the USCG issued an unrestricted combined synopsis/solicitation for a prototype Flight Data Acquisition Unit (FDAU) and the production quantities required to outfit the HC-130H aircraft against HSCG38-06-D-500111. The solicitation was posted for 30 days including questions and answers and a response extension. Ample opportunity was given for vendors to submit a proposal that met the USCG's requirement. There were five vendors that responded. The vendor chosen was MTC, now BAE. BAE provided all materials required to satisfy the installation of the FDAU which included the installation of the secondary engine instrument display system manufactured by IS&amp;S.</p>
<p>IS&amp;S is the only manufacture of the EIDS installed on the HC-130H aircraft. The system contains proprietary software that IS&amp;S has developed specifically for the EIDS. IS&amp;S has provided a statement indicating that their system, the technical data, and their drawings are proprietary. They have indicated that no authorization has been given to any other vender to repair this material.</p>
<p>The cost for the government to perform the required steps necessary to reengineer the software, establish the technical data and drawing package and/or to procure this data from IS&amp;S would be extensive in order to overcome the sole source barrier.</p>
<p>(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed in writing an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.102 and 5.201, a sources sought notice was posted on FedBizOps seeking repair sources on November 17, 2010. The only written response was from the OEM, Innovative Solutions and Support (IS&amp;S) of 720 Pennsylvania Drive, Exton, PA 19341. They indicated there repair capabilities and that they are the only authorized repair source for this material.</p>
<p>(11) A statement of the actions.</p>
<p>The USCG does not have the required data or drawings to overcome the sole source barrier to competition.</p>
<p>As the Aircraft Inventory Control Point (AICP), ALC is tasked with supporting systems that have been deployed for use in the aviation community. However, in an effort to increase competition among affiliates and distributors, LRS Product Line members annually attend aviation trade shows, extensive Internet database research is conducted and procurements are advertised in FedBizOpps. In support of the Competition in Contracting Act, ALC established the New Product Development Branch (NPD). The NPD representative assigned to the LRS Product Line has the responsibility to locate new sources of supply/services and alternate acceptable products</p>
<p>New Product Development representative with Engineering and contracting continuously conduct market research through sources sought notices, posting RFQs and RFPs in FedBizOpps, attendance of trade shows and networking to ensure that companies interested in doing business with the USCG are given every opportunity to compete for our requirements.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS-United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timely consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protestor essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns with the USCG as an Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of a informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman; solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Forman Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protestors must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protestor's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protestor may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternate to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless the contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, DC 20593-0001, FAX:202-475-3904.

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

SEE STATEMENT OF WORK FOR MORE DETAILS

Period of performance: 01 April 2011 to 20 April 2011.

SEE Statement of Work in the attached solicitation.

This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates the provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27.
 This is a 100% small-business set-aside.

The NAICS Code for this requirement is 237120 with a size standard of 31.0 mil.

The contract resulting from this combined synopsis, solicitation, will be a firm-fixed price contract. 

DELIVERY/SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS: Prices shall be FOB destination, Required period of performance is: 01 April 2011 to 20 April 2011.

PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS: N/A

EVALUATION PROCEDURES/BASIS FOR AWARD The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract using FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).

An LPTA evaluation will be performed for each of CLIN. Only one (1) award may be made to the responsible quoter(s) who:1) quotes the lowest evaluated price.
 Information submitted by the offeror must sufficient to establish that the quoter is proposing the services specified above. Quoters are not required to submit quotations for all CLINs. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with quoters. Quotations should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.

Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
 APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.
 ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire.

The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.
 The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

<DESC>Questions:
<p>1) What is the incoming pressure of argon? Normally we work with a 30psi coming in and turn it down to where we need it to make the atmosphere work.</p>
<p>2) Normally, when we have an inert atmosphere unit, we include a rapid cool down on the system. When we go to cool down, the inlet and exhaust dampers open and air is forced through the system. Can this be included or should it be removed from our standard design?</p>
<p>Answers:</p>
<p>1) Line pressure in our argon distribution system is 60 PSI.</p>
<p>2) Paragraph 4.0 requires that the oven be a current production model as described in currently published literature. If that is a feature of the manufacturer's standard design and is not published as an option then it must be included.</p>

<DESC>This amends the previously issued announcement for Solicitation No. N889510061 (Combined Synopsis/Solicitation).
The following changes are made to the requirement:
1.  Questions and Answers to Questions Received Thru 3/2/2011:
Q21:  There are three doors that do not have strike locks on them (Haumana Classroom, the Bookstore & the door to the right Staff Only door).  Do we add them to the Contract Price Schedule?  Also, is there a drawing that shows the locations to install the motion sensors and the alarm keypads?  Please advise.A21:  The doors in question would have to have the striker plate installed. The doors do have the electric installed for key pads, however. The break room door can be removed from the scope as there is no need at this time to have a strike door or key pad installed. There is no map on where to install the motion sensors or key pads for the alarm. They would be installed within industry standards on the designated buildings.
THIS IS LIKELY THE FINAL QUESTION THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED CONCERNING THIS REQUIREMENT.  ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SUBMITTED AFTER THIS AMENDMENT MAY NOT BE ADDRESSED.
All other terms and conditions of the announcement remain unchanged unless specified herein.

<a href="mailto:Adam.Hemken@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the questions and responses. 


Question 5:	Has VA developed set standards and benchmarks for the caregiver training? 	
Response 5:	Page 13 of the Statement of Work describes standards for timeliness in the provision of the training curriculum. Page 15 of the Statement of work describes how the VA will assess quality of the work performed. 

Question 6:	 What will constitute training success and the ability of caregivers to apply for financial assistance?	
Response 6:  Caregiver knowledge and skill will be assessed by a VA clinician during a home visit following the caregiver training.  Successful completion of the caregiver training is only one component of the assessment of eligibility to be certified as the primary family caregiver. The contractor is not responsible for the ability of the caregivers to apply for financial assistance, only for the provision of caregiver training.

Question 7:	Is any kind of assessment for certification included as part of the training?	
Response 7:	The training should include a measure of knowledge gained by the caregiver whether the training took place in a classroom, or through self-instruction. The contractor will be responsible for assessing the caregiver knowledge during the training. The care manager will assess the caregivers knowledge and skill and determine if the caregiver has been adequately trained.  (Reference Program Development and Requirements, Page 10).

Question 8:	What differences, if any, are there between the training content for caregivers under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers and those under the Program of General Caregiver Education?	
Response 8:	The length of training and scope of training content are significantly different between the two programs  This information is clearly stated in the RFP.  Page 10 and Page 11 of the Statement of Work specifically identifies the content differences.

Question 9:	Is there an existing advisory group whose expertise will be coordinated by the VA or is the contractor expected to develop such a group?	
Response 9:	The VA will provide access to VA SMEs and caregivers who will provide input and feedback. 

Question 10:	Will the curriculum be piloted before full-scale implementation?	
Response 10:	Due to the speed with which the curriculum must be implemented there will be no formal pilot phase 

Question 11:	Is evaluation of the training included within the scope of work?	
Response 11:	Yes, reference deliverable 10 on page 13.

Question 12:	Will train-the-trainer trainings be included or just development of the print curriculum? Should refresher courses in option years be included?	
Response 12:	Reference Deliverable 6 of the Statement of Work.  The contractor is expected to deliver Train-the-Trainer sessions as well as develop the print curriculum.  Two trainings are planned in the option years - all curriculum materials are to be up-dated within 30 days of the new option year.  We do not anticipate implementing Train-the Trainer refresher courses.

Question 13:	 If trainers are VAMC staff, how will quality control and/or oversight be provided? Response 13:	There will be four VA regional training coordinators who will provide oversight for quality of all caregiver training in their region.

Question 14:	 Who will host the web-based course? 	
Response 14:	The Contractor is to host the web-based course.

Question 15:              Were trying to identify the funding availability. Clarification:  We are looking for a budgetary estimate. 
Response 15:  This program is funded.  We do not have a budgetary estimate to provide.  

Question 16:	Who will house and deliver the DVD/self-study materials?	
Response 16:	The Contractor will house and deliver the DVD/self study materials. 

Question 17:	 Will the contractor need to cover all production costs for printed materials and DVDs?	
Response 17:	Yes 

Question 18:	Approximately how many caregivers per year will attend in-class training?	
Response 18:	In the Comprehensive Program the number of caregivers attending in-class training are anticipated to range from 84-850.  In the General Caregiver Support Program the number of caregivers attending in-class training is anticipated to range from 500-2000.

Question 19:             The solicitation states quarterly training and a class size of 25 maximum: Will there be a minimum enrollment for each class?	
Response 19: 	In the Comprehensive Program there is no minimum class size.  In the General Caregiver Support Program there is a minimum of six.

Question 20:	Will the quarterly training be held in each of the 21 VISNs (so, 21 classes, 4 times each year)?	
Response R20:	Yes  however the total number of classes may shift among VISNs depending upon the need. For example one VISN may need classes 6 times a year while another may require two. 

Question 21:	Across the country, how many concurrent sessions are running? Can the sessions be staggered?	
Response 21: 	Sessions can be staggered  however anticipate a surge in requests for training as soon as it becomes available. 

Question 22:	 The solicitation states that the training should occur between 8am and 8pm. How many days will each classroom training last? How long should each training day be? 6 hours? 12 hours?	
Response 22:	We have not specified the number of classroom days to be delivered.  However, page 9 under Program Development and Requirement of the Statement of Work states clearly that the length of training for the Comprehensive Program is to be no more than 6 hours per day.  

Question 23:	 Will the contractor need to provide staff to conduct the in-class caregiver training or will all caregiver training be done solely by VAMC staff (who have gone through train-the-trainer training)?	
Response 23:	The contractor is expected to deliver all of the training. 

Question 24:	Will the contractor need to reserve and set up all training spaces at VAMCs or will the reservation and set-up be done internally at the VAMC?	
Response 24:	The contractor is expected to have its own training locations.  Space at VAMCs will be available only at the mutual agreement of both parties.  Reference page 8, para 1 of the Statement of Work.

Question 25:	 Since contractors cannot be expected to have facilities in each of the 21 VISNs, is provision of training at a nearby hotel an acceptable alternative?	
Response 25:	Yes, however our market research demonstrates that most offerors should be able to find adequate facilities either in-house or at no additional cost. Should a facilities be required that would need additional funding support, i.e., hotel, that must be coordinated with the Program Manager at least 15 days prior to the training.

Question 26: 	 If the contractor needs to reserve VAMC space for training, what support will the contractor have to accomplish this?	
Response R26:	The Caregiver Support Coordinator at the local VAMC will provide assistance with reserving VAMC space. 

Question 27:	Will the contractor need to handle VAMC staff training assignments for the in-class training?	
Response 27: 	No 

Question 28: 	 Is the contractor expected to handle the registrations for caregivers? 	
Response 28:	Yes.

Question 29:	Does the contractor need to set up a registration website?	
Response 29:	The contractor will need to establish a secure mechanism for Caregiver Support Coordinators to identify for the contractor the caregivers who are eligible for the Comprehensive Program training.

Question 30:	The solicitation states that: Any modifications or request for alternate training location will require advance concurrence by the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) or VA Program Manager (PM). Could you elaborate on this statement? Who would be making a modification or request for alternate training location? A caregiver? A VAMC staff member? What implications would a modification have for the contractor?	
Response 30:	We anticipate that this kind of request will be rare, it would most likely come from the caregiver and the Caregiver Support Coordinator.  Some examples of possible costs to the contractor might be staff travel or room rental fees.  We will add a not to exceed CLIN to the pricing schedule for this effort.

Question 31:	Is this a fixed-price contract? If not, what is the contracting method?
Response 31:	Yes. This is a FFP contract. 
			
Question 32: 	One point that would be useful to have clarification on is the funding expectations of the VA for this overall solicitation. We understand that the VA wants the funding broken out over the cost schedule. But, we do not have a clear sense of the VAs expected budget scope.	
Response 32:	Because this is the first training of this type, budget details are not currently available. We are counting on your experience and expertise to develop a prudent method to deliver this product to the VA.

Question 33:             Does the contractor need to maintain any records that would need to be integrated with other VA systems (e.g., maintenance of online course completions)?   
Response 33:            Yes  VA requests that the Contractor provide the caregiver with a print certificate of completion of caregiver training and send a copy electronically to the referring Caregiver Support Coordinator.

<p>4. POSITION TITLE: Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: GS-13 equivalent ($71,674 - $93,175 - additional locality pay adjustments may apply depending on assignment location.). Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate's past salary, work history and educational background.

<p>There may be an initial training program in Washington, D.C. for up to one year, which will include formal classroom training and on-the-job training; and may include security training.</p>
<p>After completion of Washington training, the Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/M) may be assigned to Washington, other locations in the United States, or an overseas office, and will be required to serve through rotational assignments.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies. OPS performs these functions through three teams, namely, Operations Support Team, Overseas Administration Team and Field Support Team. The Operations Support Team provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue, Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, and Consequence Management. It also provides overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and to other sectors necessary to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies. The Military Liaison Unit (MLU) is part of this team and manages OPS liaison with the U.S. Military.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

**QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ADDED AS ATTACHMENT - 3/02/2011**
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), through the Office of the Chief Counsel (AGC), requires professional legal services to provide support and to supplement in-house legal resources for the FAA's environmental work.  
Legal help is needed to assist in the review and preparation of Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) or Environmental Assessments (EAs), pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and related environmental statutes for airport development and reconstruction and the defense of litigation associated with these projects.  Currently, the FAA has numerous airport development and reconstruction projects in progress or slated for future development. Ordinarily these airport development and reconstruction projects increase operational efficiency at airports and are often directed at expanding capacity and reducing delay within the national transportation system.  
This work is specialized for the federal government, i.e., not a commercial item.  The attorneys engaged in performing this effort will be serving FAA in a professional legal capacity and will be bound, as applicable, by all privileges and other professional obligations that attach to this relationship.
The period of performance for this effort will be from the Date of Award through twelve consecutive months, with four additional one-year options to be exercised at the discretion of the Government.
This is a Full and Open procurement with applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541110 (Offices of Lawyers) with a size standard of $7.0 million.
Interested parties responding to this solicitation are directed to the attached Screening Information Request (SIR).  All questions/inquiries must be provided in writing by 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) Friday, February 25, 2011 to Janella Davis at janella.davis@faa.gov.  Proposals are due by 2:00 PM EST on Monday, March 14, 2011. See Section L of the SIR for more information on submittal of proposals and written inquires. 
Prospective offerors are hereby on notice that any amendment(s) issued to this SIR will be published on this website https://faaco.faa.gov/ under the current announcements for the FAA Headquarters. It is the Offerors' responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates on this procurement. 
The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the SIR, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement.
This announcement does not obligate the Government to award any effort resulting from SIR DTFAWA-11-R-00066.

<DESC>HELICOPTER OPERATIONS SUPPORT TRAILERDue date for quotes has been extended to April 30, 2011.This is also an advance notice of an amendment that will be issued on or about April 15, 2011, which will include changes to the following clauses: - Update B.1 - change wording from "...all-risk.." to "...all hazard..." in opening paragraph. - Update C.1 - due to change in Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-47 - Update D.2 - units offered under this solicitation can be either a self-propelled unit or a unit hauled by a transport vehicle - Update D.2 - D.2.1.3,#8 - the requirements for the generator will be 10,000 watts (10kw) - Update D.2 - D.2.1.4,#8 - the AM and FM radios are required to have the same frequency ranges as stated at D.2.1.4 #2 and #3  - Update E.3 - due to change in Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-48 - Update Exhibit D - Wage Determination No. 1995-0221, to Revision No. 26, dated 11/18/2010NOTE:  At this time, based on the tentative issue date for the national amendment, I do not plan to extend the due date for quotes beyond April 30.The following questions and answers are included to become a part of the resultant agreement.  Additional questions and answers are posted in a separate document on FedBizOpps.Q:  I have a couple of questions on the helibase specs. One spec is for a Whisper Quiet generator. That is a brand name. Is the spec saying that the generator must be that brand or is it a general sound requirement.  If it is a sound requirement what decibel ratting is whisper quiet?. Also, the size of the generator that you are requiring is going to need its own trailer. How are we going to get paid for transportation to and from the fire with two tow vehicles (one for the trailer and one for the generator trailer)?A:  If you search the internet for whisper quiet generators you get more than one brand.  You are required to meet the specification listed while providing whisper quiet technology.  The specification at D.2.1.3, #8 external generator, should have stated 10,000 watts (10kw). Q:  The last spec that is confusing is the 2 AM and 2 FM portable radios. As written, it sounds like I just need to go to Wal-Mart and pickup a couple of Walkmans. If the spec is intended to be for communication radios it needs to specify what frequencies the radios need to broadcast. A:  Please refer to D.2.1.4, #8  Two (2) AM and two (2) FM handheld radios.  CLARIFICATION:  For frequencies, follow the frequency ranges for the AM radio in #3 of this specification (i.e., 118-137) and #2 for the FM radio of this specification (i.e., 406-420) Q:  Im hoping to bid on the Helicopter Support Trailer solicitations coming up and I wanted to know if self-propelled units would be acceptable as well as a trailer as you have made in amendment 4 with the GIS solicitation? See copy of amendment below. Solicitation AG-024B-S-11-7001 has been amended with Amendment 4  Description:\nD.2.1.1 - I have received numerous questions if a self-propelled unit would be acceptable on this solicitation. This has been discussed with Fire and Aviation Management and either a self-propelled unit or a trailer hauled by a separate vehicle will be acceptable. All units, whether self-propelled or a trailer, will be required to meet the specifications stated in the solicitation. D.2.1.1, Type 1 and Type 2 units, the following is provided as a clarification on the license referenced at #11: ArcGIS 9.3.1 or higher to ArcView license level. However, the Vendor should have the full install of ArcGIS 9.3.1 or higher, which includes ArcEditor and ArcInfo functionality. If these additional levels of the ArcGIS suite are needed the government is responsible for providing the license to "unlock" or "activate" this additional functionality.A:  A self-propelled unit or a unit hauled by a transport vehicle will be acceptable on this solicitation.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO), Satellite Programs Acquisition Division (SPAD), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with EMS Technologies, Norcross, Georgia, for LEOLUT and GEOLUT upgrades using the procedures in FAR Part 15. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC253(c) (1) as implemented in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."
<p>This contract would be to refurbish 10 Local User Terminal (LUT) by procuring and installing new server and hardware "components" to maintain the health in 8 operational and 2 test LUTs. The strategy for implementation will be to refurbish 10 LUTs at 4 sites (AK, FL, MD, and GU) and include one base year of Operations and Maintenance. There will be an option to perform the same upgrade to 4 additional operational LUTs at 2 sites (HI and CA).</p>
<p>In addition to the above, this contract will have the option to extend Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) including providing technical and operational support on a yearly basis, for up to 4 additional years for a total of 5 years inclusive of all options. The decision to upgrade rather than replace the LUTs will drastically reduce any downtime associated with transition and cost for completely new LUT's.</p>
<p>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 517919 applies. The small business size standard for NAICS Code 517919 is $25 million.</p>
<p>All inquiries should be submitted in writing by e-mail to Edith.L.Jones@noaa.gov referencing RFP No. DG133E-11-RP-0072. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, if any other interested parties believe that they can meet the Government's requirements, they may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which if timely received will be considered by NOAA. ALL information must be submitted within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements. Please provide commercial and government pricing. Responses must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other information that demonstrates that the proposal meets all of the requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be emailed to the point of contact by March 17, 2011. Award will be made using FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, current through FAC 2005-48. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within discretion of the Federal Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:

The United States Agency for International Development in Jordan (USAID/Jordan) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a five-year Cost Plus Fixed Fee Term contract to provide an overarching framework to support the implementation of and capacity building for the development of Alliances and Public Private Partnerships (APPPs).  U.S. interests lie in creating a fully liberalized economy through pro-private sector policies that create a level playing field for entrepreneurs.  The program will support this goal, as well as provide the next step for the Government of Jordan (GOJ) as it completes its goals under privatization and looks toward the innovative use of APPPs to leverage additional funds for development.  Building alliances with private sector actors will also allow the USAID Mission to capitalize upon additional opportunities to leverage non-US government funds, address cross cutting themes, and promote long-term sustainability.  The total estimated value is between $19-28 million and anticipated buy-ins with a total estimated value of $ 22 million.

<p><strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</strong><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" />DoD is developing a Terminal &amp; Networking Roadmap (TNR) that engages with the DoD Laboratories to identify future technology insertion opportunities, that solicits gaps and issues from the Operational Community to determine communications needs as captured in DoD Roadmaps/Visions (i.e. Air Force 2020 Vision), and that discovers emerging technologies within Industry developed through research and development (R&amp;D) or from leveraging existing commercial IT advancements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The TNR will <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>provide decision makers with an enterprise level "strategic view" that lays out a timeline for making key decisions about terminal and networking technologies and defines the data required to make those decisions.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;MILSATCOM is a vital piece of the DoD communications architecture as it provides the space-based network connectivity needed to deliver global communications to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>tactical national security operations in areas that lack terrestrial infrastructure, as well as to mobile platforms. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The TNR will help decision makers within the DoD to examine all current, evolving, and futuristic ground networking infrastructure, and terminal architecture technologies that will be available in the 2020 to 2030 timeframe. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This examination will allow the DoD to take advantage of these capabilities and move forward on a path towards developing mitigation strategies for existing capability/requirement gaps and threats. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>With the current cancellation of the TSAT program, the role of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) constellations is anticipated to expand to fill MILSATCOM capability and functionality gaps. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>DoD also turns to commercial SATCOM (COMSATCOM) assets to fill in essential bandwidth gaps, and appears willing to continue exploring SATCOM options such as leased capability and hosted payloads in the future.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><br />The operational requirements of the MILSATCOM terminal architecture are moving towards full functionality across multiple frequency bands and communication protocols. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>As such, future MILSATCOM architecture components (terminals, systems, ground infrastructure, etc.) should be designed with both the flexibility and adaptability to operate across different MILSATCOM satellite systems and communications layers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Commonality at the component level would increase terminal affordability and interoperability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order for DoD to maximize the use of its existing SATCOM resources while leveraging new technologies, joint service collaboration and planning must be a part of a forward-moving strategy that focuses on; increased terminal capabilities, affordability, a unified approach to network management and connectivity, and decreased IA vulnerabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><br />The path to develop enhanced satellite terminals is challenging because many of the legacy satellite terminals and associated satellite systems were designed to function as independent systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Integrating these legacy systems with new technologies to meet DoD demands for a more interoperable, integrated SATCOM architecture is a huge challenge. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>An integral piece of this new architecture is the interoperability of the space, aerial, and terrestrial communications layers. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Changes in SATCOM demand (increased AISR and Communications On The Move (COTM), for example) within this integrated architecture require us to leverage legacy assets while exploring new technologies, incorporating a mix of SATCOM options to successfully meet the warfighter's operational requirements.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to amend the previous notice:
1) to change the NAICS Code from 541310 Architectural Services to 541330 Engineering Services, and 
2) to extend the deadline for receipt of SF 330's to March 17, 2011
3) To answer the following Request for Informations:

Q1:      I would like to get some clarification on the  Replace Incoming Water Mains & Valves project, Solicitation # VA-259-11-RP-0059 , at the VAMC, Grand Junction.  From the synopsis of the solicitation, we understand that the construction work for this project is strictly outside the building and no construction will be inside the building.  Is this correct?

A1:The intent is to replace the grounds water main to the shut off of each building or device. Domestic water to Building 1 will be the shut off manifold, basement mechanical room. Domestic water OPA will be the shut off manifold, 1st floor mechanical room. Fire protection will be to PIV or shut off valve on manifold inside building. Valves on fire hydrants are to be replaced.

Q2: Para 1, sentence 2 refers to "domestic water systems" while sentence 2 refers to "...piping, fittings and 
valves associated with fire protection to the buildings". Please clarify if the project addresses domestic  water supply or fire protection water supply, or both.

A2: This project addresses both the domestic water supply and the valving connections that provide fire protection service to the buildings and grounds (hydrants).
