<CONTACT>Brent Foreman, (405)954-7894
<DESC>SYNOPSIS The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for Boeing high fidelity PowerPC-based models of their proprietary engineering simulations of the 737, 747, and 767 airframes modified to interface with Flight Management System (FMS) and pilot models developed by the FMS manufacturer and the FAA.  The aircraft models consist entirely of proprietary software owned by the Boeing Company.  These models are the recognized standards on which all certified flight simulators of the particular aircraft are based and are used as reference bases for the aircraft manufacturer.  They are the best models obtainable of the flight characteristics of the three aircraft that represent roughly half the commercial airframes flying in the NAS.  Combined with the latest versions of Flight Management Systems models, they will have all of the functionality needed for modeling operations in the planned RNP-based NAS, as well as international airspace covered by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) regulations.  These services and simulation are the only available for Boeing as they are the manufacturing source of the aircraft and the source for the proprietary engineering simulation soltware that is being procured under this requirement.  The requirement is being processed using limitation of sources to a single source as provided for under the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Sections 3.2.2.2 and 3.2.2.4.  Due to the proprietary nature of the software involved in the model process, there is no alternative source for this service.  For the FAA tools developed using the models to be recognized as valid, it is essential that the models represent the actual products as closely as possible and, in this case, the manufacturer is willing to provide versions of his actual software with additional capabilities that will allow it to be used in our testing, simulation, and analysis.   Any questions must be in writing to Brent D. Foreman, Contracting Officer, FAA, Aviation, Medical & Training Division, AMQ-310, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK 73125 , Phone (405) 954-7894.

<SOLNBR>FA8725-04-R-0004
<RESPDATE>120103
<ARCHDATE>02142004
<CONTACT>Kent.Kinal@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force to identify potential sources capable of executing the Joint Interface Control Office (JICO) Support System (JSS) program. System Description The JSS will provide the JICO with ability to manage the Joint Multi-Tactical Data Link Network (MTN) and overcome Joint and combined interface deficiencies related to the planning and management of the Joint MTN.  The Joint MTN consists of the Tactical Data Links (TDLs) and participating nodes (also known as the Multi-TDL Architecture or MTA), and the data flowing therein.  The JSS will be an independent system and will not initially be integrated into other tactical systems. The JSS will consist of a common set of hardware and software, recognizable and operable irrespective of the OPFAC in which it is placed.  The system will be operated and maintained by trained JICC personnel.  While it is recognized that this requirement levies additional space and lift requirements on host OPFACS, it ensures that across the Joint battlefield, one system designed specifically to contribute to interoperability is itself interoperable.  As part of the life-cycle maintenance process the JSS program office will develop updated and certified software packages through an established Configuration Control Board process.  Once the software package has been tested and verified it will be readied and delivered for use in all the JSS systems in accordance with the Program Management Plan (PMP). The JSS will aid the JICO organization in the planning and management of the MTN in the full spectrum of operations, from peacetime training to deliberate war/crisis operations.  The JSS will provide a JSS Data Repository (JDR) from which the JSS can access existing MTAs, Link-16 network designs/descriptions and other MTN related planning and management items.  The JSS will have access to a local JDR database as well as a remote JDR database.   The remote JDR database will provide data to various deployed JSS systems and will be a master repository for MTN planning and management information. The JSS has no associated sensors and it will function much like any other interface unit (IU) in the MTN.  The JSS will operate in an environment where individual nodes (ships, airplanes, and C2 sites) are not the systems with which it interfaces; rather, it will act upon the data links directly.  The JSS aids the JICO in collaborative planning through communications interfaces with the JPN and GCCS, and through a link to the remote JICO Data Repository (JDR), in addition to interacting with other JSS-equipped OPFACs in the JOA.  The JICO will exercise authority within the MTN using both voice communications and TDL-specific management messages.  The backbone of the MTN is the Link-16 network; the JICO will interact within the RF environment (ideally) or via Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) means.  The JSS will enable the JICO to assume a forwarding role, enabling data transfer and translation among all eligible components of the MTN.  The JSS will plan for and statically manage gateway entry points of the Ground Digital Network (VMF messages) and the Intelligence Network (IBS). Scope of Effort The duration of the contract runs from FY04 to FY09.  The JSS contractor will provide system engineering design, engineering analysis, software development, software/hardware integration, system testing, support for certification testing, training, operational support during exercises and system installation support, life cycle support concept, security, training, and production deliverables.  The contractor will be required to develop JSS software in accordance with the Open Architecture, message standards (6011,6016), extensible, support information assurance and security.  The JSS capabilities will be provided in 3 blocks.  Each block will be developed, factory and field tested, produced, and installed. Prior blocks will be upgraded to the subsequent block. A tentative production plan is provided below. USAF Fielded Deliverables Block 1 (FY05-FY06)  9 Common Core Capability (CCCs) and 1 CCC spare and training for 9 units Block 2 (FY06-FY07)  9 CCCs and 10 Block 1 to Block 2 upgrades and training for 9 Block 2s and delta training for 9 Block 1 to Block 2 upgrades. Block 3 (FY07-FY08)  1 EMD CCC and 7 CCCs and 19 Block 2 to Block 3 upgrades and training for 8 Block 3s and delta training for 18 Block 2 to Block 3 upgrades. Navy Fielded Deliverables Block 1 (FY05-FY06)  9 CCCs and 1 CCC spare and training for 9 units Block 2 (FY07) 10 CCCs and 10 Block 1 to Block 2 upgrades and training for 10 Block 2s and delta training for 9 Block 1 to Block 2 upgrades. Block 3 (FY07-FY08) 1 FEC and 3 CCCs and 20 Block 2 to Block 3 upgrades and training for 4 Block 3s and delta training for 19 Block 2 to Block 3 upgrades. Army Deliverables Block 3 (FY06-FY09) 11 CCCs and 1 CCC spare and training for 11 Block 3s USMC Deliverables Block 3 (FY07-FY08) 15 CCCs and 1 CCC spare and training for 15 Block 3s JFCOM Deliverables Block 1 (FY06)  1 FEC and and training for 1 units Block 2 (FY07)  1 FEC Block 1 to Block 2 upgrade and delta training for 1 Block 1 to Block 2 upgrade. Block 3 (FY08)  1 EMD FEC and 2 FECs and 1 Block 2 to Block 3 upgrade and training for 2 Block 3s and delta training for 1 Block 2 to Block 3 upgrade. Interim contractor support including in-field support will be provided until Block 3 has been fielded.  Contractor logistics support for hardware and software will commence in FY08 after block 3 is completed for one year.  The contractor will have necessary test assets required for sustainment.  The purpose of this announcement is to help the government identify interested potential offerors capable of providing proven yet contemporary approaches to develop an automated toolset and information repository to facilitate the JICO ability to overcome Joint and combined interface deficiencies related to the planning and management of the Joint MTN. Responses must be submitted in a MS Word 98 or higher format or PDF format and should not exceed twelve (12) one sided, 8.5x 11 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Basic Neuroscience Program (BNP), Division of Intramural Research (DIR), plans to procure on a sole source basis with State University of New York (SUNY), Anthropology and Neurosciences, Science 1, Room 113, PO Box 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902-6000 services for the NINDS Serum Archive Project.  The services and supplies herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industrial Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.   The NINDS Human Serum Collection began around 1956.  As a result of years of fieldwork on neurodegenerative diseases throughout the world in remote regions such as New Guinea and the other Pacific Islands, the collection grew.  The Serum Collection is currently housed at the Rockville Contract Facility and due to its stored condition, is not useful to scientific research. There is no updated inventory of this collection. The Collection is in need of considerable effort to make it usable.  This collection will be transferred to the University of New York at Birmingham.  The University will accept the collection and assure it is shared with other research institutions.  Period of performance: base year of twelve (12) months with four (4) twelve (12) month option periods.   This is a scientifically valuable serum collection but in its present state has no merit as a resource due to the inability to accurately access both samples and the associated sample information.  Dr. Ralph Garruto from State University of New York (SUNY) was a principal investigator in the NINDS Laboratory of the Central Nervous System Studies that began this collection and continued it for many years.  Dr. Garruto, having done much of the collecting of the samples as well as research from the collection, is the only person from the original laboratory, who has the knowledge to identify the various individual series collection notes, techniques and codes of the samples and then reconcile them with the appropriate sample within the collection.  Due to the lack of a standardized note and numbering system, knowledge of the various collection systems utilized is required in order to reconcile the appropriate notes to the matching sample.  This is critical to insure scientific accuracy and therefore the research worthiness of the collection. The State University of New York is the only source known to NINDS that can provide the services and personnel required to inventory the serum collection. This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM, EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on December 1, 2003.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  His Excellency Ilie Sarbu, Minister, Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, Waters and Environment, Government of Romania, 1 Victoreiei Sqaure District 1, Bucharest, Romania, Phone: (40) 21 410 24 07, Fax: (40) 21 335 60 57.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study on the development and deployment of an Integrated Water Resources Management System (IWAREMS).

The water resources in Romania are characterized by their unequal distribution.  Romania is a large territory (232,000 km) with a fairly large population (22 million), which presents a challenge to the Romanian Government in securing the necessary water resources for users dispersed throughout the country.  Over the past 200 years, Romania has developed a complex water system consisting of hundreds of hydrotechnical structures.  However, in recent years, Romania has experienced heavy rains that have led to flash floods.  This has severely taxed the existing antiquated water management system and has led to numerous fatalities and economic losses in excess of $20 million per year, a problem that has been compounded by industrial water pollution. Coupled with the inherent problems of an emerging economy, these issues are a threat to the Romanian social foundation and highlight the need to revise the existing water control and monitoring systems. 

The Government of Romania (GOR) initially responded to these challenges through the launch of a National Integrated Meteorological System (SIMIN) followed by a Destructive Waters (DESWAT) pilot project.  SIMIN is a weather radar project that generates meteorological data for rapid and automatic input to flood modeling systems.  This is important because it provides useful forecasts that allow citizens and businesses ample time to prepare for floods.

The DESWAT project, funded by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, is a hydrological project designed to assess and deploy computer models used to investigate and forecast flood conditions in large and small river basins.  The success of this Feasibility Study has led to a $64 million investment (secured by a sovereign guarantee) to implement DESWAT.  This implies a significant upgrading of Romania’s hydrological monitoring system, enabling real-time monitoring and rapid response to serious flood conditions.

Building upon SIMIN and DESWAT, the meteorological and hydrological predicting projects respectively, the Ministry of Waters and Environmental Protection is now planning to set up and deploy WATMAN.  WATMAN will use the data provided through the input of SIMIN and DESWAT and will integrate that data with other actors to create a modern instrument for water management and disaster response.

The development and deployment of the IWAREMS system will be a part of an overall Water Management (WATMAN) system that will assist Romania in creating a modern instrument for water management and disaster response.  WATMAN is one of Romania’s largest projects to date in the water sector.  It is important because it represents the culmination of a number of previous feasibility studies and pilot programs regarding water management.  The WATMAN system will integrate all of the information related to river basins in Romania and will include all relevant actors- water agencies, industrial, urban, and agricultural users- within a modern instrument for water management and disaster response.    

The development of WATMAN is critical, based on the requirements laid forth by the European Union (EU), a body that Romania aspires to join by 2007 and that requires all members to have a national strategy for water resources management. 

WATMAN will be implemented in three phases.  The first of which would be a USTDA-funded Feasibility Study on the equipment and components of IWAREMS and an economic analysis of the existing water management system.  The second study, to be funded by USAID, will cover specific modeling for eleven Romanian hydrological basins within the WATMAN system.  The third phase will be the implementation of the first two phases, including implementation on a national scale and the finalization of a Romanian water management system.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $517,960 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, DECEMBER 30, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) in support of the Department of Defense (DoD) Communities of Interest (COI) is seeking commercial vendors who provide hosted web services to facilitate mission critical tasks across functional and organizational boundaries.  The purpose of this initiative is to assess commercial capabilities in providing a secure method of conducting real-time collaboration on items of interest.  These items of interest can include real-time operational planning, emergency response and exercise support.  The COI initiative will leverage emerging technologies and techniques taking advantage of new rich on-line collaboration environments featuring secure (cryptographic user authentication and data encryption) text, video, audio, application casting/sharing (documents and data), alerts, instant messaging and low-bandwidth chat as well as presence information. 
This is a request for information (RFI) and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement. This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a contract will be issued. The government invites comments and interested parties to submit their indication of interest, along with:  documentation addressing the technical specifications of their service offering; the costs to the government for the services; reference accounts; network topology and services architecture; statistical data that documents ability to provide web services to a global constituency; technical point of contact; any proprietary/non-disclosure data requirements and availability for testing in a proof of concept lab.  The government does not intend to otherwise pay for information received in response to the RFI.
DISA developed the following initial requirements to evaluate commercially hosted collaborative services for DoD Communities of Interest:
a. Functionality (i.e., multiple and simultaneous one-to-one, one-to-many, few-to-many, and many-to-many real time communications using combinations of live video, recorded video, audio over the network, application casting/sharing, annotation capability, and text).  Presence and addressing are important functions as well.  User must be able to control presence status (online, offline, available, busy, away, appear offline, etc).  Ability to hide presence/restrict presence to designated staff.  Ability to alert when presence status changes.
b. Usability (ease of use for client to manage contacts, group lists, profile info).  
c. Interfaces (web, thin, mobile client).
d. Reliability/Scalability (number of concurrent connections supported, 24x7 availability, ability to support millions of users.  Alternative routing capability in response to Internet congestion and availability.
e. Performance (service delivery, bandwidth requirements and constraints).  Proven ability to withstand on-demand surge for network and application resources.
f. Supportability (Manageable at Enterprise Level + ability to delegate to lower levels/groups).
g. Logging and archiving.  
h. Extensibility (software development kit availability, ability to customize product code).
i. Directory Services (integration with LDAP).
DISA is also interested in evaluating responses on the best way to price this type service, e.g., would your company prefer to see pricing by usage, by license, by site, by user group, etc.?    
Responses to this RFI should be formatted as follows:
a. Technical capabilities statement addressing all the initial requirements described above.  Also address your intentions to team with other vendors to provide a total solution.   
b. Pricing methods available both as a total solution and separately priced functional offerings to include volume discounts.  Range of users may include 0-200,000 users, 200,000-2 million users and 2-4 million users.  Include a definition of what constitutes your group, license, site, etc.
c. State your business size.  
d. Include information as to whether the services being proposed are on GSA schedule or other contract vehicle and provide information about that contract vehicle.
The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations. Firms who wish to respond to this should send responses via email NLT 1 Dec 03.  Interested vendors should forward their capabilities and other information to be considered to Linda Goff at goffl@scott.disa.mil.

The RFP will be available for downloading from the FEDBIZOPPS website at www.fedbizopps.gov on DECEMBER 2, 2003.

The United States Trade and Development Agency (hereinafter “USTDA” or the “Government”) is considering the provision of grant funds for a feasibility study on an Industrial Capacity and Market Development Initiative in Afghanistan.  The objective of this contract is to secure advisory and assistance services in determining whether to fund a feasibility study or studies or any alternative activities that the Contractor sees as a viable option for USTDA consideration.  This means the Contractor’s recommendation will take into consideration the entire range of USTDA program capabilities, such as alternative technical assistance, orientation visits, trade capacity building activities or training grants. USTDA’s website, www.tda.gov may be used as a resource tool.  To specifically meet the objective, the Contractor shall provide expert analysis on: potential economic and financial viability of the proposed project; potential exports of U.S. equipment and services that could be utilized in project implementation; and priority of the proposed project to the host country and project sponsor.

The Contractor shall provide a final report to USTDA.  The Contractor shall use a project life cycle approach in formulating recommendations, analysis of the issues and a recommendation on whether USTDA should fund a study or studies on the project(s).  All recommendations to fund a study shall include a complete budget and terms of reference.
 
Successful reconstruction of Afghanistan will require the development of a sustainable economy led by a vibrant private sector.  The Contractor shall identify opportunities for USTDA to support industrial capacity and market development in Afghanistan.  Such support should encourage the development of domestic Afghan industry, stimulate trade, and create jobs for Afghan citizens.  In particular, the Contractor would investigate the possibility of funding a study that could include: an assessment of existing industrial parks and other similar facilities in Kabul and elsewhere in Afghanistan; a market analysis that will help determine what industries offer the best prospects for investment in Afghanistan; an assessment of the managerial and vocational training needs to support increased industrial development; and an assessment of the transportation and logistics issues that need to be addressed.  It will be necessary for the Contractor to conduct a comprehensive review of international assistance being provided to Afghanistan that identify unmet needs and ensure that projects recommended do not duplicate current efforts.

Through the funding of feasibility studies, orientation visits, specialized training grants, business workshops, and various forms of technical assistance, we help U.S. businesses compete for infrastructure projects in emerging markets.  We assist in building mutually beneficial partnerships between American companies and overseas project sponsors that result in increased U.S. exports and jobs, and the completion of high quality, successful projects in host countries.

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) intends to increase the maximum quantity ceiling of Lithium Sulfur Dioxide Battery packages that can be ordered under Firm Fixed Priced, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contracts DAAB07-02-D -A204 with SAFT America, Inc., Valdese, North Carolina, and DAAB07-02-D-A205 with Eagle-Picher Energy Products Corp., Vancouver, Canada.  This is a restricted action under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1.  These batteries include the BA-5590B/U, BA-5800A/U, BA-5600A/U, BA-5588A/U, BA-5598A/U, BA-5599A/U, BA-5112A/U, BA-5567A/U, BA-5093, BA-5847B/U, and BA-5557A/U.  These batteries are used in many of the militarys tactical and strategic communications-electronics manportable equipment.   This action is necessary due to the significant increase in demands as a result of recent and current military operations and to ensure a steady supply of these batteries as these operations continue.  The original contracts were competitively awarded in  accordance with FAR 6.302-3, Industrial Mobilization.  No competition is expected for this action as the two aforementioned contractors are the only current known sources for these batteries who have passed First Article and Safety Testing for the most cr itical batteries, i.e., the BA-5590B/U and have active production lines currently delivering to the Government.  The proposed new maximum quantities of battery packages are as follows: BA-5590B/U to 3,124,855; BA-5800A/U to 1,081,640; BA-5600A/U to 183,280 ; BA-5588A/U to 456,000; BA-5598A/U to 187,200; BA-5599A/U to 47,340; BA-5112A/U to 142,440; BA-5567A/U to 1,618,960; BA-5093 to 12,240; BA-5847B/U to 75,840; and BA-5557A/U to 59,280.

<DESC>NA The United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) invites you to apply for funding for the fiscal year 2004 Deployed War Fighter Protection Research Program (FY04 DWFP), administered by the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB).  The AFPBM is soliciting proposals for original research that helps protect the deployed military ground forces through control of insects that carry diseases of military significance, with emphasis on the benefits of insecticides.  Ideally the research wo uld support the testing, evaluation and registration of new public health insecticides, or new formulations of existing insecticides, new or improved modalities for personal protection from biting arthropods, or would improve the efficacy of new public hea lth insecticide application technology and equipment.  Research must be product oriented and should focus on the following:  testing and evaluation of novel chemistries or formulations of public health insecticides for area control or control in structures  of mosquitoes, other biting flies and filth flies; novel fabric protectant chemistries for military field uniforms and bednets against blood-feeding insects; and innovative public health insecticide application technology and equipment.  The research must  be applicable to the military but should be transferable to civilian uses. It is anticipated that approximately $1.6 million will be awarded this year, with future years subject to the availability of funds.  Proposals may not exceed a total cost of $250,000 per year for up to 3 years, including direct and indirect costs.  Approx imately 5-6 awards are anticipated.  Funding is anticipated to begin in May 2004.  Projects will be selected on the basis of scientific merit determined by external peer review, and programmatic relevance determined by an Armed Forces Pest Management Board  integrated process team.  Preproposals will be accepted from investigators who are employed by or affiliated with an eligible institution.  Eligible institutions include for-profit, non-profit, public, and private organizations.   Examples include univers ities, colleges, hospitals, laboratories, companies, and agencies of local, state, and U.S. Federal Government, with the exception of USDA investigators, who are ineligible to apply.  Please note that President Bush signed the Fiscal Year 2004 Appropriation Bill on September 30, 2003.  This request for preproposals announcement is being released prior to the actual receipt of funds (appropriated in the bill for this research program) at  the United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA).  Actual funding of projects received in response to this announcement is contingent on the receipt of funds at USAMRAA. In order to apply for funding under the FY04 DWFP, applicants must first submit an electronic Preproposal by December 15, 2003, 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET).  Preproposals shall be submitted electronically through the USAMRMC FY02 Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) by accessing the web site http://www.usamraa.army.mil/pages/index.cfm; click on the BAA link, followed by the BAA Preproposal Form link.  Full Proposal submission requirements will be mailed to applicants with invitations to submit full proposals.  I nvited applicants must submit full proposals by February 27, 2004, 4:00 p.m. ET.   The following is the estimated timeline for the FY04 DWFP. Preproposals Submission Deadline:			December 15, 2003, 4:00 p.m. ET Invited Full Proposals Submission Deadline:		February 27, 2004, 4:00 p.m. ET Peer Review:						March 2004 Programmatic Review					April 2004 Award Start Date:					Between May and September 2004 For additional information or questions, please contact:   Ms. Patricia Evans USAMRAA 820 Chandler Street Fort Detrick, MD 21702-5014 Phone: 301-619-7354 E-mail: pat.evans@amedd.army.mil

Offerors planning to  submit bids for the TD P+P would be required to bid this work as well.  This  work would include software integration and travel, in order to interface the  TD P+P module of the EBS to GOTS prototype/proof of concept applications,  described below, that serve the automation needs of scientists and engineers.   This application, currently in development, will provide scientists an  intuitive interface to an automated process for creating, storing, and printing  Case Files.  Training needs are expected to be minimal to nonexistent.  We are  in the process of defining this requirement and will make more details  available as soon as possible.           Automated R+D Case File Proof of Concept - A build and automation of  process workflows that focus on AFRL Work Unit Management processes of the  S+Es. The application will build and then automate these workflows, where  additional user input screens will be designed and built to guide S+Es through  the data entry steps of each phase of Case File generation. A relational  database will be built to store normalized data for select AFRL forms so that  data entered once by the S+Es can be reused in future steps. Once forms are  complete and approved, the proof of concept will allow S+Es to print them for  physical filing into the paper Case File, as well as electronically file them  into the EBS Document and Records manager. The reporting features of the proof  of concept will ideally integrate the PureEdge form manager functionality,  depending on policy directives for use of that tool.           Work Center Support Proof of Concept - This user interface will be  designed and specifically configured for the S+Es. In this interface, S+Es will  be able to open a "one-stop-shop" portal instance and have access to select  common enterprise and personal applications and information. Ideally, each  individual application will appear in the interface as an object or applet,  which links to or initiates an application function as necessary. Some of these  applications have been identified and requested by the S+Es, a "yellow pages"  capability, for example. This build model will allow S+Es to access a list of  said application applets and "subscribe" to the functions of choice or  necessity. AFRL constituents, knowing the required framework for applet design  and configuration, could then potentially have their applications considered  for the applet library, assuming there are no technical, policy or process  conflicts. ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST UPDATE:  The preliminary information  contained at the end of the Industry Day Q+A attachment has been coordinated  and approved and should be considered final. ======================================================================== 15 Oct 03: Updated: The draft model task order has been updated, as reflected  in the "Draft Model TO 15 Oct" version now visible on this website.  We have  added the IOC and FOC dates to the document. ======================================================================== 14 Oct 03:  Update:  Questions and Answers from Industry Day posted as an  attachment along with information on conflicts of interest.  DRAFT Model Task  Order added to documents list.  OFFERORS ARE REQUESTED TO REVIEW DOCUMENTS AND  PROVIDE ANY WRITTEN COMMENTS/SUGGESTIONS TO christopher.parsons@wpafb.af.mil OR  lynne.lair@wpafb.af.mil.  EARLY INDUSTRY INPUTS MAKE IT MUCH EASIER TO TAILOR  THIS ACQUISITION. ======================================================================= 7 Oct 03 NOTICE: DRAFT Documents from Industry Day have been posted to this  website.  More to follow soon.  Request all PRIME Encore contractors verify  receipt of this updated information by sending a confirmation e-mail to  christopher.parsons@wpafb.af.mil or lynne.lair@wpafb.af.mil.  Thank you. ====================================================================== The HQ Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is contemplating awarding a task  order pursuant to the authorities established under Defense Information Systems  Agency (DISA) Encore GWAC Contracts (http://www.acquireit.disa.mil).  The  following preliminary information is for all DISA Encore Contract Holders.   Interested subcontractors contact Encore prime contractors via the above DISA  website. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is drafting an IT requirement for  Technology Directorate-Level Planning and Programming (TD Level P+P).  The  purpose of this notice is to establish contact with all interested Encore  contractors and provide preliminary program information.  Please provide  telephone and e-mail information for your primary point of contact for this  effort to the AFRL contracts negotiator, Ms Lynne Lair, at  lynne.lair@wpafb.af.mil by 22 Sep 03.  Future Information will be via  http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/ under short title "EBS TD-Level P+P",  solicitation number "FA8652-04-Q-0002".   Preliminary requirements overview:  TD Level P+P is a component of the larger  AFRL Enterprise Business System (EBS) program, which provides integrated  business processes and smart enterprise-wide IT Portfolio Management.  Quality  and schedule are critical to successful integration of this component into the  larger program.  TD Level P+P will support planning and programming processes  at all geographically separate TDs and integrate with the HQ-level P+P effort  already under development. The TD-level P+P capability will be provided via  commercial off the shelf (COTS) software and will integrate with the standard  EBS database and provide input, analytical, and reporting tools to facilitate  TD planning and programming and inputs to HQ-level P+P.  AFRL anticipates this  requirement will include configuration of the COTS tools for AFRL processes,  COTS licenses, customer training, warranties/software maintenance, and follow- on technical support. Tentative Schedule:   Industry day - at Wright-Patterson AFB OH - 14 Oct 03 (date/location not  finalized yet) T.O. award -  Mid-Dec 03 Software Delivery - End of Mar 04 Preliminary Acquisition Information:  As part of the technical evaluation,  offerors will be required to demonstrate proposed software in a number of  scenarios on-site at HQ AFRL, WPAFB OH.  AFRL anticipates that one task order  will be placed with the Encore contractor that offers the best value to AFRL.   This task order will be incrementally funded and is currently subject to  availability of funds, as FY04 funds are currently not available for obligation. ---All information herein is preliminary only and subject to change as the AFRL  team finalizes the requirement---  Please hold your questions/comments for  now.  We will be actively seeking industry feedback on our draft requirements  soon.  Do not contact the technical team directly.  Further information will be  provided to interested offerors by this office on the PIXS website as it  becomes available. For more information on 04Q0002--EBS TD-Level P+P please refer to http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixslibr/04Q0002/04Q0002.asp

<DESC>Offshore Petroleum Discharge System(s) (OPDS) consisting of U.S.-flag self-sustaining vessel(s) and associated equipment for the deployment, operation, and redeployment of OPDS in support of the Defense Energy Support Center's Prepositioning Program.  See DRAFT Request for Proposals (RFP) on the MSC website (www.msc.navy.mil - Contracts - Active Requests for Proposals (RFP) - then search under PM-3 as the program office).  Although the closing date reads 21 November 2003 there has been no closing date established.  However, MSC requests questions/comments by 21 November 2003 and anticipates that an RFP will be issued shortly thereafter, will close during January 2004, and will be awarded in July 2004.  It is anticipated that the charter period will be 12-months firm with three 12-month options and one 11-month option.  After award, but prior to acceptance by the Government, the Contractor will be required to demonstrate that their system meets all of the minimum technical capabilities, as well as any other operating capabilities, as described in the Contractor's proposal.   Based on today’s technology, MSC considers Dynamic Positioning to be a realistic approach to the vessel requirement for maintaining a fixed position and deploying hose.  Considering the sea state (wind and current) parameters set up for deployment and operation, MSC is skeptical that mooring is an acceptable solution.  However, with proper justification and documentation msc will consider alternate methods.  Your attention is drawn to Part I, Box 18, which asks that you provide the end of charter purchase price for the vessel(s) and hose system (Note: This option may be exercised at the Government's sole discretion) and that you provide any fees required, should the Government not exercise any option

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Division of Intramural Research (DIR) Clinical Research Program (CRP) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on a non competitive basis with Suburban Hospital, 8600 Old Georgetown Road, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. NIH initiated five (5) protocols on cardiac diseases in which Suburban Hospital is the sole cohort. The NIH does not have a sufficient patient population or skilled research nursing staff essential to assure development of these protocols. As such, the NIH requires regular access to patient populations that include acute cardiac patients such as those at Suburban Hospital. The protocols also require the service of skilled research nursing support to provide on-site enrollment, processing, and follow-up of patients at Suburban Hospital.  It is essential that these resources be in close proximity to the NIH campus to facilitate prompt access to NIH investigators and other available NIH clinical resources that may be required, specially in emergency situations.  The period of performance of the study is December 15, 2003 through December 15, 2004. This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6, Competition Requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 623110, Size Standard $11.5 million. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement. Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PS-2004-004 may be submitted by mail to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, Building RKL2, Suite 6042, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention Ms. Cecilia Morales, Purchasing Agent. All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.

Background Information
The Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) provides general executive assistance and direction, policy development, administrative management direction and oversight, operational support and liaison services for the 94 United States Attorneys' Offices (USAOs). As part of this mission, EOUSA provides information technology services to the USAOs. Detailed information regarding the mission and functions of the EOUSA can be found on the Internet at http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/index.html.
The EOUSA Case Management Staff (CMS) is converting the existing case management system from a client/server, Oracle Forms implementation to a web system. CMS is seeking GSA Schedule 70 contractors who are expert at designing web applications using Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) technologies to design and develop the web system.
The Legal Information Office Network System (LIONS) is the current case management system. CMS maintains the LIONS source code. Each USAO uses a separate instance of the database and application to manage the office caseload. Each LIONS instance is operated over the local area network within each USAO.
The Enterprise Case Management System (ECMS) will replace the multiple instances of LIONS with a single, centralized web system. ECMS will operate over the wide area network connecting EOUSA and all USAOs.
Significant requirements analysis and design work has been conducted on the LIONS to ECMS conversion. Some prototyping code for ECMS has been developed.
Note: After receipt and review of the information obtained through this RFI, EOUSA intends to establish a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to complete the ECMS design, system development, and deployment to all 94 USAOs. EOUSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for information provided.

T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.

<SUBJECT>D--HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE AND SPARING (HSMS)
<SOLNBR>N6553804Q0009
<RESPDATE>120103
<CONTACT>Ms. RoDonda Thompson, 703-681-1143, ext. 5456
<DESC>INTRODUCTION – The Military Health System (MHS) is in the process of analyzing and reviewing its approach, practices, and procedures for performing Hardware, Software, Maintenance and Sparing (HSMS) activities.  The Government is interested in finding out about new approaches, best practices or industry standards that could better meet its needs. This RFI is intended to provide the Government with a better understanding of the methodologies, best practices, performance metrics, and service level agreements that would be available to them should it be determined that a commercial solicitation is in its best interest.  In accordance with FAR 10.001(a)(3), the government will use the results from the conducted market research to determine if sources capable of satisfying the government's requirements exist. At present no decisions have been made on how these services will be acq uired. The Government requests that interested parties submit information on: HSMS Philosophy; Approach to HSMS practices; HSMS Performance Metrics; and, HSMS Service Levels BACKGROUND – The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is responsible for operationalizing TRICARE as the worldwide, integrated system for accessible, high quality and cost effective delivery of health care services to Department of Defense (DoD) beneficiaries.  The MHS provides medical support for the full range of military deployments and peacetime support to members of the Armed Forces, their families, and others to advance national security interests.  The mission of the MHS is to provide and to maintain readiness, and to provide healthcare services and support to members of the Armed Forces, their dependents and other DoD beneficiaries.  The current environment is a decentralized approach in which e ach program office and military service plays an integral role in ensuring that MHS systems and infrastructure remain operational. Some systems within the MHS require "around the clock" and "around the globe" support.  These services include the planning associated with infrastructure architecture and the processes that ensure the successful operations of the standard MHS automated information systems, including infrastructure support across more than 1,200 facilities in 14 managed health care regions worldwide. Many of these automated information systems have networking solutions that were installed to meet specific needs of local facilities, regional military medical commands, or a particular branch of military service. It is the Government’s desire that the provider’s approach assist the Government in moving towards a future goal of conducting all operations using a seat man agement approach. The MHS requires information and infrastructure services encompassing those services required to design, plan, implement, test, maintain, and sustain the organizations communications and computing infrastructure.  The Government anticipates this work to be performed using a performance-based approach, where the provider would be required to achieve a specific level of satisfactory performance in order for service to be accepted and reimbursed by the acquiring authority. For more information please visit the TMA website at http://tricare.osd.mil/mhshome.cfm The website provides detailed information on the program offices and their deployed systems.  SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST The following are examples of, but are not intended to be an exhaustive or all-inclusive list of the areas of interest that the Government would like information on: 1. Program Ma nagement – The Government is interested in understanding how commercial vendors manage HSMS contracts.  Specifically:  a) what is the contractor’s HSMS philosophy, b) approach to development/management of Service Level Agreements (SLAs), c) approach to performance metrics, d) reporting mechanisms, and e) approach to continuous process improvement. 2. HSMS Processes and Procedures – How commercial vendors perform the HSMS systems lifecycle from receipt of trouble tickets to close out, asset tracking, capacity planning, and delivery methods. 3. Transportation Services – The Government has facilities located across the globe, some in remote or difficult to reach locations.  The Government is interested in understanding how commercial vendors would be capable of meeting the Government’s unique global requirement. 4. Hardware Replacement Support – How the provider plans, manages,  implements, and monitors a process to replace broken/inoperable pieces of hardware. 5. Repair Services – How the provider plans, manages, implements, and monitors all components of repair services. 6. Preventive Maintenance – How the provider plans, manages, implements, and monitors preventive maintenance services of hardware and software. 7. Equipment Disposal – How the provider plans, manages, implements, and monitors the activities associated with the removal and disposal of excess, broken and outdated material. 8. Warranty Management – How the provider plans, manages, implements, and monitors a comprehensive process for warranty management services. 9. Upgrade Parts – How the provider plans, manages, implements, and monitors a comprehensive process to upgrade pieces of equipment under the requiring activity’s area of responsibility with the latest product revisions av ailable. 10. Software Support – How the provider plans, manages, implements, and monitors a comprehensive process to maintain and upgrade software (commercial and firmware) under the requiring activity’s area of responsibility with the latest versions available. 11. Rebuild Services – How the provider plans, manages, implements, and monitors rebuild support activities.  Specifically, the Composite Health Care System (CHCS) has some components that operate using Multi-user Microelectromechanical Processes Systems (MUMPS).  These system components will be required for the foreseeable future. SERVICE LEVEL/PERFORMANCE METRICS – The Government is extremely interested in Service Level Agreements and Performance Metrics used by industry to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of their HSMS support.  The Government is interested in operational metrics (those used to monitor d ay-to-day activities) and management metrics (those used by management to gauge key indicators of success, executive dashboard, etc.).  Additionally, the Government is interested in how industry balances using leading (forecasting) and lagging (static) metrics. Since the Government is exploring the use of a performance-based contracting approach, it would be helpful to understand the service levels/performance metrics used to manage the operations, and those metrics used as a basis for payment. SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS –  1. Size:  Submissions should not exceed 20 pages of documentation (Brochures, marketing media, or other types of products do not count against the 20 page limit). 2. Submission Address:  Please submit all information to –  TRICARE Management Activity Acquisition Management and Support Division ATTN: RoDonda Thompson  - HSMS RFI Submission 5111 L eesburg Pike Skyline 5, Suite 550 Falls Church, Virginia 22041 3.

<SUBJECT>D--Training Services for the new Composite Health Care System (CHCS) II
<SOLNBR>N6553804Q0010
<RESPDATE>120403
<CONTACT>Mr. John (Bob) Hallmark, 703-681-1143; Ms. RoDonda Thompson, 703-681-1143, ext. 5456
<DESC>The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (OASD (HA), TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) and Military Health Systems (MHS), is conducting a market survey under this Request for Information (RFI) to determine the availability of industry sources to provide training services for the new Composite Health Care System (CHCS) II.  CHCS II is the Computer-based Patient Record (CPR) System for the Department of Defense (DoD).  CHCS II is based on a set of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software applications with integration of Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) software and additional new development to meet clinical requirements. Interested parties should offer the best industry practices for the implementation and training of personnel to use the CHCS II patient transaction system.  TMA is seeking feedback, from potential sources on pertinent measurement crite ria for determining the effectiveness of training services.  Specifically, potential sources are encouraged to provide information pertaining to what Learning Management Tool they are going to use, what it will measure, how it will train students, and how it will teach proficiency and insure confidence.   TMA takes a conservative approach to preventing potential conflicts of interest (COI).  This approach includes segregation of contracting actions, mutually exclusive categories of contracts, application of non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, and conflict of interest mitigation plans.  In an effort to simplify the TMA approach to COI, TMA has broadened the application of COI restrictions from “contracts” to “categories of contracts”.   The following contract categories represent contract actions that may be executed using any number of contract vehicles (either  TMA-specific contracts D/SIDDOMS III, GSA schedules, or other agency contracts).  Regardless of the contract vehicle used, each of the “categories” is mutually exclusive.  CHCS II World Wide Implementation & Training (CHCS II –WWI&T) is considered a Category 3 action.   Category 1:  TMA Internal Support:  Services which, by their very nature, give the Contractor access to extensive data about the contracts of all other TMA contractors.  This Category specifically includes the TMA AMD Internal Support Contract and the TMA Office Automation Support Contract.   Category 2:  Program Management Support:  Services which assist TMA in planning and managing its activities and programs.  This includes, for example:  requirements analysis, acquisition support, budget planning and management, business process reengineering, program planning and execution support, and independent te chnical management support. Category 3:  Product Support.  Services or end items required to meet the mission requirements of TMA’s non-purchased care activities and programs.  This includes, for example:  concept exploration and development; system design; system development and integration; COTS Procurement and integration; internal development testing; deployment; installation; operations; and maintenance. The CHCS II –WWI&T, Request for Proposals (RFP) is anticipated to be released in late calendar year 2003.  Questions concerning the composition and requirements of the RFP, as well as those regarding the nature of the services to be performed under CHCS II – WWI & T, will not be entertained at this time.  Offerors will be given ample opportunity to formally submit questions after the RFP has been released.  No contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement . This announcement does not constitute a commitment, implied, or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued nor will the government pay for any information or action forwarded in response to this announcement.  The Government anticipates holding an Industry Day in early December to provide a CHCS II demonstration and other information related to the requirement.  Details relating to Industry Day will be published at a later date.   Questions related to this RFI may be addressed to chcsiiwwiandt@tma.osd.mil, or by phone to Bob Hallmark at 703-681-1143, ext. 5465, or to RoDonda Thompson at 703-681-1143, ext. 5456. CITPO Task Manager:  Alma J. Abalos, Col, USAF, NC, 703-681-7143, ext. 4705 NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME. Information should reference Sources Sought Announcement Number N65538-04-Q-0010.

<SUBJECT>A--METOC TACTICAL APPLICATIONS SOURCES SOUGHT
<SOLNBR>XXXXXXXXXX
<CONTACT>Jim Watts  202-781-3958
<DESC>Program Executive Office – Integrated Warfare Systems, Advanced Systems & Technology Office in cooperation with the Operational Effects Program Office in PEO C4I is seeking sources for the design, development, integration, validation, installation and support of METOC Tactical Applications for all Navy and Marine Corps Warfare Areas using a spiral build process.  Formal design and development processes ensure that the applications meet the operational requirements and the software design reflects the required system specifications.  The software must be well documented using state-of-the-art software tools.  METOC Tactical Application development is accomplished using C, C++ and Java software languages in an Object Oriented framework.  METOC Tactical Applications use several different types of inter-process communications.  The current Applications use RMI, CORBA, XML and other c ommercial standards.  The legacy applications utilize Automatic Data Entry – Inter-process Control (ADE-IPC) and are required to be updated as Software Trouble Reports (STRs) are reported and corrected.  The Defense Information Infrastruction Common Operating Environment (DII-COE) used in the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) and Global Command and Control Systems – Maritime (GCCS-M) is the high-level architecture being implemented and utilized for these Applications Meteorology and Oceanography (METOC) Tactical Applications Program.  Point of Contact: Paul R. Tiedeman, Program Manager, (202) 781-1531, e-mail:tiedemanpr@navsea.navy.mil, Fax: (202) 781-4703. METOC Tactical Applications are currently in the Fleet as part of GCCS-M Version 3.1.2.1.  The new METOC Tactical Applications are being developed under the Common Operating Environment (COE) Version 4.7.  The s oftware segments developed under the COE architecture must be level 7 compliant.  Environmental data is available through a seamless interface to the Tactical Environmental Data Server (TEDS)/Tactical Environmental Data Services (TEDServices)  As part of the fielding/delivery process to the GCCS and GCCS-M host systems, there are specifications and documentation standards that must be adhered to. The Applications must be compatible with and utilize the DII COE Joint Mapping Tool Kit (JMTK), the new Commercial/Joint Mapping Tool Kit (C/JMTK) and the Polexis WebCop.  In addition, the METOC Applications must be interoperable and be able to display outputs on other Mission Planning Systems such as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS), Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) and C2PC.  Applications are currently being delivered and deployed to the U.S. Navy, DISA and several Alli es.  The detailed METOC Application architecture must be flexible enough to comply with the requirements for these implementations as well. METOC web services are being developed and will be deployed in the near future.  As METOC Applications are developed, the architecture/design needs to accommodate the web services paradigm.  The existing design is based on an N-Tier Architecture.  It employs industry best practices with separation of the business logic, data and presentation layers allowing for greater software re-use in multiple Thick Client systems as well as web based User Facing Services (UFS) and Data Oriented Services (DOS).  METOC Tactical Applications are being integrated into the Navy Enterprise Portal (NEP) and must be fully compliant with those requirements/standards to be part of the NEP.  The NEP is used to integrate services throughout the Navy, and to prov ide services for enterprise portal participants such as quality assurance, data standardization, metadata management and interoperability.

<DESC>Solicitation /Synopsis:  This combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  The Northern American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) 423720, and employee standard size of 500.  The proposed contract listed is set aside for small businesses.  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE:  A complete pulse-jet dust collector system Torit Model 81MBW10 or equal.  The system shall be capable of providing continuous on-line cleaning for a volumetric flow rate of 11000 SCFM.  The collector system shall operate at an air-to-media ratio of 8.5 :1 (FPM).  The model shall include 10’ filter bags.  The pulse-jet bag collector shall be supplied in factory-assembled units sized to meet airflow capacities and design requirements. The collector shall have a bolted and welded construction using 12 gauge HRS and designed for a +/- 20” water gauge. The unit shall come complete with pulse-jet pipework, 1” single diaphragm valves, pilot solenoid valves in NEMA control boxes, 4” square x 3/16 wall square tubing compressed air manifold, 4”x 4”structural support legs with cross-bracing, lifting lugs and discharge hoppers with 18” x 18” inside dimension flanged discharge openings with a minimum angle of 60 degree from horizontal.  The backside of the hopper shall be a quick opening 22” diameter hopper access door for each hopper.  The compressed air reservoir shall be provided with 1” NPT pipe coupling at both ends for attachment of clean and dry compressed air supply at 90-100 PSIG and at a temperature exceeding 150 degrees Fahrenheit.  Round-shaped, filter bags made of 16 ounces of polyester felt material with untreated finish shall be supplied.  The round bags and galvanized cages shall be secured to the ¼” plate tubesheet by a radial compressive force supplied by a stainless steel spring band in the bag cuff and the cage cap to provide an airtight seal between the bags and tubesheet.  This bag and cage combination is not recommended for applications requiring electrical grounding.  The filter bags shall be arranged in a vertical configuration, serviced from inside the collector walk-in clean air section.  Dust-laden air shall enter the collector through the hopper, impact against a target plate deflecting heavy material down into the hopper.  The rest of the dust-laden air passes up through the collector in a flow pattern that has been engineered to minimize abrasion and provide even dust loading  on the media surface.  Clean air will pass through the media, enter the clean air chamber and exit the collector.  The collector shall be controlled by a solid-state printed circuit cleaning control.
