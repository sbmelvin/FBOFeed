<SUBJECT>U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Design-Bid-Build Services, Modernization of the Agricultural Research Technology Center (ARTC) in Salinas, California
<SOLNBR>1232SA19B0001
<CONTACT>Stephen Stolte, Contracting Officer, Email Stephen.Stolte@ars.usda.gov
<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the modernization of the Agricultural Research Service Technology Center (ARTC) at Salinas, CA. This ARTC Modernization Project will be implemented by the Design-Bid-Build project delivery method and will involve the construction of entirely new research buildings. The USDA has developed a complete set of Construction Documents (plans and specifications) showing and describing the project's requirements.
<p>This solicitation will be a Total Small Business Set Aside.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The mission of the Crop Improvement and Protection Research Unit at Salinas, CA is to improve germplasm of lettuce, celery, spinach and melon, determine basic biology of viral, fungal and bacterial diseases affecting these crops, develop alternatives to methyl bromide as a soil fumigant for control of soilborne pests in strawberry and vegetables, reduce post-harvest losses of lettuce, develop scientifically based organic crop production practices, develop methods for control of weeds, and improve artichoke production practices including insect and disease control.<br /><br />The existing facilities at ARTC are inadequate for addressing its expanding research program. The four wood framed laboratory/office buildings constructed in the 1940s are deficient in interior air quality, and in meeting current seismic safety engineering, mechanical, electrical and building code standards. A fully completed design for the D-B-B project was completed in 2007 but the project had to be delayed. The design drawings and specifications are currently being updated by an AE firm to meet current building codes and regulations. It is ARS intention to have this construction project certified as LEED Silver.<br /><br /><strong>REQUIREMENT:</strong> The selected Construction Contractor will be required to provide all of the necessary construction services of this modernization project. The project scope includes the demolition of outdated buildings and constructing new facilities in 2 phases. The 2 phases are as follows:<br /><br />1) Phase 1 - West Lab/Office, 31,600 GSF<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - East lab/Office, 39,400 GSF<br /><br />2) Phase 2 - Headhouse/Greenhouse, 37,000 GSF</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL:&nbsp; </strong>The contract Period of Performance is approximately 1440 calendar days (Base and all Optional Items) after the issuance of the Notice to Proceed. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 (Construction), with a Small Business Set Aside size standard of $36.5 million. <br /><br />The contract will be awarded, based on the Best Value "Trade-off" process, to the firm whose proposal, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, provides the best combination of experience and cost/price reasonableness. The technical evaluation factors will be Past Performance, Proposed Construction Project Team, and Project Management/ Technical Approach. In making this determination, all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. The Government reserves the right to make the contract award to other than the lowest price offeror, price and other factors considered. <br /><br />Bid Bonds will be required. Performance and Payment Bonds will be required by the successful offeror. <br /><br />The solicitation documents will be available for viewing and downloading on FedBizOpps (www.fedbizopps.gov) on or about January 7, 2019.<br /><br />ARS is planning on holding a pre-proposal conference &amp; site walk thru at the location on January 15, 2019. Confirmation of this date will be provided in the solicitation. Interested offerors should pencil this date in.<br /><br />Plans and specifications will NOT be provided in hard paper copy. The solicitation and all amendments for the RFP will be posted on www.fbo.gov<br /><br />This procurement requires the use of biobased products to the extent that such products are reasonably available, meet agency or relevant industry performance standards, and are reasonably priced. Where available, these products should first be acquired from among qualified products that fall under the umbrella of items designated through the USDA BioPreferred SM Program".<br /><br />It is the responsibility of the contractor to check www.fbo.gov frequently for any amendments or changes to the solicitation. The Government is not responsible for any loss of internet connectivity or for an offeror's inability to access the documents posted at the referenced website. No CDs or hard copies will be made available.</p>

<DESC><strong>Highway 20:</strong><br />T13S, R09E, Sections 19, 29, 32, and 33; T14S, R09E, Sections 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 24; T14S, R10E, Sections 19, 30, 31 and 32; and T15S, R10E, Sections 5, 23, and 24, Willamette Meridian, Deschutes County, State of Oregon.<br /><br /><strong>Background:<br /></strong>In 2013, 2014, and 2015 the herbicide Perspective&reg;, a Forest Service-approved herbicide at the time, was applied along Highway 20 to control broadleaf weeds and brush. Perspective&reg; contains an active ingredient now known to harm ponderosa pine and other trees.<br />&nbsp;<br />In 2014 foresters first noticed the occurrence of stressed trees along Highway 20. From 2014 through 2018, ponderosa pines continued to become stressed and die adjacent to the highway. Foresters began to suspect that herbicide use might be affecting trees and the use of Perspective&reg; was discontinued on National Forest System lands in Oregon and Washington. Sampling of trees indicate that herbicide use was the likely cause of death of ponderosa pine trees adjacent to the highway.<br /><br />Consequently, there are herbicide-killed and dying trees with herbicide injury located immediately adjacent to Highway 20. In addition, there are danger trees with an Imminent-failure potential (high likelihood of breaking/failing) located within 1.5 times their tree height (typically 150 feet slope distance) of the highway. Due to the very high volume of traffic on Highway 20 there is a need to abate (fell) trees that pose a threat to public safety.<br /><br /><strong>Statement of Work:<br /></strong>Herbicide affected trees located within the first 75 feet from the edge of the highway, and imminent danger trees and dead trees located within the clear zone shall be felled, processed, decked and slash piled at designated landings. The clear zone is defined as an area from the edge of the highway pavement to a distance of about 30 feet. Any tree that is felled for removal shall be processed and have slash removed to designated locations. No activity fuels (slash, tops, logs, etc.) will be left in the clear zone area. These decked trees will be sold at a later date under a separate contract.
<p>Imminent danger trees and dead trees not affected by herbicides and located outside the clear zone would be felled and left in place to meet wildlife coarse woody debris requirements.</p>
<p>In areas 75 feet to 150 feet from the highway, imminent danger trees would either be 1) felled and left as coarse woody debris to meet wildlife coarse woody debris requirements or 2) topped to provide wildlife habitat if the tree meets tree topping safety requirements.</p>
<p>The project area is approximately 450 acres in size. Currently, all trees needing to be cut have been identified and are marked with blue or yellow paint on the backside of the tree. A secondary marking will occur closer to the time of contract solicitation/operations to mark trees on the front side as well. This would also include a tertiary color for marking trees to be cut and left as coarse woody debris or in sensitive areas where there is a need to limit equipment and number of "entries". During the process of secondary marking, trees that will need topping will also be identified.</p>
<p>Imminent danger trees needing topping will only occur within the 75 to 150 feet zone and are estimated to be minimal. Topping would occur on designated trees that are 16 inches or less DBH and would be topped at a height low enough that equipment could safely cut.</p>
<p>This project requires rubber-tired, cut-to-length logging equipment (harvester and forwarder) to move felled trees and slash to designated landings located about 250 feet or more from the edge of Highway 20 (see map tiles 1-6 for these designated locations). Tracks will not be allowed on rubber tires due to working alongside highway. There will also be a need for hand felling larger diameter trees and subsequent removal to a landing.</p>
<p>Highway traffic control would be provided and subsequently coordinated with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) when sections of the highway need to be temporarily closed to conduct timber falling operations. Traffic control measures are estimated to last up to a 20 minute period. It is anticipated the project would take place during the spring shoulder season. Daily prework meetings with Contractor/Operators, ODOT and Forest Service shall occur as needed. The timber falling operation would be completed as soon as possible to avoid extended impacts to commercial freight traffic and the general public.</p>
<p>There is a need to work simultaneously on both sides of the highway to minimize highway closures, so a minimum of two sides (two harvesters, two forwarders and two hand fallers) will be needed. Also, all felling shall be completed before moving onto next section which includes both ground based and hand felling operations. Forwarding and processing may occur when traffic is not stopped as long as this can be safely performed.</p>
<p><strong>Timing:<br /></strong>It is anticipated that the contract for this work will be solicited in mid to late-February with a 2 to 4 week solicitation period with bids due in early March. Operations will be dependent upon snow and weather conditions, but are anticipated to occur as early as April 15 or as late as May 1st. There may be short notification for the commencement of operations due to adequate site conditions. This is a time-sensitive project in which operations shall be completed in the shortest amount of time possible and must be completed prior to May 24, 2019. There is also an expectation that operations shall occur Monday through Friday from 7 am till 5 pm until completed, unless otherwise agreed to.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this will be a daily rate type of contract.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance</span></strong><br />The design build contract is anticipated to commence in late 2019 with an approximate performance period of 10 months for completion of design (final construction documents) and 38 months for completion of construction for a total performance period of forty-eight (48) months.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Location</span></strong><br />Indian Health Service (IHS) Rapid City Service Unit at 3200 Canyon Lake Drive, Rapid City, SD. All questions or inquiries regarding this project shall be directed to Jenny Scroggins at Jenny.Scroggins@ihs.gov .</p>

The purpose of the libraries is to provide peptide reference data for laboratories, both within NIST and to the worldwide scientific community, using mass spectrometry to discover disease-related "biomarkers."</p>
<p>In order to meet mission requirements, the BMD has a need for a mass spectrometer system capable of generating high quality tandem mass spectra of ions generated by electrospray ionization for a very wide range of ion classes and fragmentation modes, including installation, training, one-year warranty and three one-year option periods for maintenance.</p>
<p>This instrument shall acquire spectra for many applications including building mass spectrum reference libraries of all precursor ions of selected pure compounds under the most widely applied fragmentation modes; analysis of all ions arising from protein digests in order to identify as many number and variety peptides with high quality spectra as possible; and to acquire good quality spectra for all ionized components in mixtures of metabolites and other mixtures of small molecules including environmental samples and food extracts.</p>
<p>The total period of performance for the equipment, warranty and maintenance shall be a base period of one-year and three one-year option periods.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>Sole source determination is based on the following:</p>
<p>Market research has revealed Thermo Fisher Scientific is the only source that can provide a commercially-available mass spectrometer that meets NIST's minimum need by combining quadrupole, linear ion trap, and orbitrap mass analyzers, and featuring CID and HCD fragmentation techniques, available at any stage of analysis, with subsequent mass analysis in either ion trap or orbitrap mass analyzer.</p>
<p>The required system is a commercial item, manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thermo Fisher Scientific has proprietary rights to the required system, and is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the system. Thermo Electron North America, LLC has no authorized resellers or service providers, therefore, only they can supply the required equipment and service.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by January 4, 2019 will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>Contracting Office Address</p>
<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E232 Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Genitourinary Cancer Pathogenesis (LGDP), Prostate Cancer Genetics Section (PDGS) laboratory plans to procure a test of the phenotypic hypotheses using immunohistochemistry (IHC) from Histoserv, 19526 Amaranth Drive, Germantown, MD 20874. There are two major goals: 1) NCI will section and stain the entire cohort of patients at the same time, enabling direct quantitative comparisons between cases within the study; 2) NCI will use phenotypic staining data to inform and correlate with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) responses, using automated image analysis for the creation of tumor and tissue IHC heatmaps in the same plane as mpMRI.</p>
<p>The NCI procedure for surgical radical prostatectomies preserves the entire prostate gland and is whole mounted. For resected prostate samples from NCI, this requires sectioning on to double wide (2x3) slides. The samples for this study are primary tissue patient samples, which cannot be recreated and are irreplaceable. The 2x3 embedded blocks are not common, the overwhelming majority of histology work is on 1x3 embedded blocks.</p>
<p>While it is extremely important that these sections be done correctly, it is also important to retain consistency through the study. Since Histoserv was the company that processed the other samples in prior cases, changing contractors would add a new variable that could affect the quantification, interpretation and analysis of results. Therefore, this solicitation will be sole sourced.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $15,000,000.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:<br /><br />Provide the Histology services needed:<br />Tissue Sectioning and Haemotoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining of soft tissue in Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) blocks</p>
<p>On single wide format slides<br />2 1x3 H&amp;E slides from 2 soft tissue FFPE blocks<br />58 1x3 unstained slides from 2 soft tissue FFPE blocks</p>
<p>On double wide format slides<br />57 2x3 H&amp;E slides from 57 soft tissue FFPE blocks<br />1653 2x3 unstained slides from 57 soft tissue FFPE blocks</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 12:00 PM EST, on January 7, 2019. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed 240-276-5401 or emailed to David Romley, Contract Specialist OR via electronic mail at david.romley@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the System for Award Management (SAM) through sam.gov. Reference: 75N91019R00009 on all correspondence.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION<br />PURSUANT TO FAR Subpart 5.2-Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT TO ACTION. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE/PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions, on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award a contract that builds upon an existing infrastructure of the NINDS Human Genetics Resource Center, also known as the NINDS DNA and Cell Line Repository.<br /><br />REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br />The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect, currently through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-94, 2005-95, dated January 19, 2017.</p>
<p>STATUTORY AUTHORITY <br />This acquisition is conducted as non-competitive under the authority of 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 3304(a)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND<br />The NINDS DNA and Cell Line Repository (hereinafter "the NINDS repository") was founded in 2002 with the goal of accelerating genetic discoveries in complex and other neurological disorders by providing service to NINDS awardees, serving as a resource of biological samples and accompanying clinical and genotypic data for the scientific community, and promoting sharing and thus synergizing science. The NINDS repository was initially established via contract (NO1 NS 2 2349) to Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Coriell). The contract was recompeted in 2008; at that time there were samples from ~ 24,000 unique individuals in the collection. Coriell competed for and was awarded contract HHSN271200800033C for collecting samples from an additional 30,000 unique subjects. The period of performance for this cost-reimbursement contract is September 30, 2008 - September 29, 2019, and the total dollar amount obligated to date is $29,536,372.</p>
<p>Based on the current collection pace, the repository will have collected ~28,000 unique samples by September 2019, which is 2,000 short of the 30,000 unique samples needed. There are four disease areas (Cerebrovascular Disease, Dystonia, Epilepsy, and Tourette's Syndrome) that have ongoing sample submissions that need to continue past September of 2019. According to an October 2018 programmatic need of sample submission forecast, NINDS anticipated needing an additional two years to collect samples from the remaining ~2,000 unique subjects. For example, the Dystonia Coalition and the Brain Vascular Malformation Consortium (BVMC) propose to submit additional samples over the next two years to the repository that has already collected 3,500 and ~1,500 samples from the Dystonia Coalition and BVMC, respectively.</p>
<p>Additionally, NINDS is currently evaluating its full portfolio of repositories and the corresponding scientific needs that these repositories meet to determine overall resource needs in the foreseeable future. While the majority of NINDS DNA collections are in the NINDS repository, several scientific programs have collections in different repositories, under a variety of grant and contract mechanisms. In January 2019, a new Scientific Director will be joining NINDS and it is anticipated that the new Scientific Director, in conjunction with the Program Manager and the Director of the Division of Neuroscience, will consider potential efficiencies that may be gained by consolidating collections and will determine the future direction of the repositories. It is expected that the requirement will substantively change from the current state.<br />While evaluating the future direction and collecting samples from the remaining ~2,000 unique subjects, NINDS requires a contract for two years of continuation of services, at the status quo, for the existing repository and an additional six-month option period for transition services. The six-month transition period will allow NINDS time to transition the collection if there is a need to move the collection from the current contractor location at Coriell to a new facility at the end of the two-year period.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</p>
<p>The intended source is:<br />Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Inc.<br />403 Haddon Ave<br />Camden, NJ 08103-1505</p>
<p>As indicated in the Project Background section, there are ongoing collections for projects spanning four neurological disease areas that need to continue past September of 2019. In order to keep sample collecting for ongoing projects uninterrupted, to maintain consistency in sample processing, and to reach the targeted collection diversity it is scientifically and administratively critical to have Coriell provide this service for an additional two years to meet the requirement of collecting samples from 30,000 unique subjects. The Coriell facility is fully compliant with all Government requirements and would require no lead time to perform these services since the repository is currently housed at Coriell. <br />If another contractor was awarded this contract for the upcoming two-year period for continuation of services after September of 2019, the NINDS collection of approximately two million sample tubes and the associated clinical data would need to be moved from Coriell to the new facility. This transfer includes: 1) inventorying, packaging and transferring each sample to a shipping container, 2) transporting the containers in multiple shipments to a new facility, and 3) offloading each sample, inventorying it, and storing it at the new facility. In addition to the physical aspects of the transition, the transfer also includes: 1) developing a new data storage (and backup) system, 2) creating protocols for collection, storage and distribution; and 3) developing and maintaining searchable web-based interfaces to display inventory, associated phenotypic data, and other data portal activities to support the NINDS repository functions. Since the repository services under this proposed contract are to cover only a two-year continuation of services, this transfer would cause a substantial duplication of cost to the Government, as the cost of moving and transitioning the NINDS repository is estimated to be more than the cost of one full year of service. This cost is not expected to be recovered through competition for this interim requirement.<br />In addition to the transition time, start-up time and substantial cost, moving the samples would also unnecessarily put the two million samples in potential harm's way. These precious and irreplaceable samples collected from patients that were carefully selected by the NINDS funded investigators are stored in liquid nitrogen tanks and -80&deg;F freezers and could be damaged or destroyed if they are not properly handled or kept within an acceptable temperature range. Each time the two million tubes are moved, there is risk of potential sample damage or loss. Potentially moving them in 2019 and again in 2021 would pose unacceptable risk to the Government's irreplaceable samples.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br />The estimated period of performance is as follows:<br />Base Period: September 30, 2019 - September 29, 2020<br />Option Period One: September 30, 2020 - September 29, 2021<br />Option Period Two (Transition Services): September 30, 2021 - March 30, 2022<br />Total period of performance: September 30, 2019 - March 30, 2022</p>
<p>Contract Type:<br />Cost-reimbursement</p>
<p>Specific Requirements:<br />The Contractor shall receive, process, store, create and distribute biological samples and associated phenotypic and genotypic data, manage and track all associated data and human subjects materials, act in an administrative, educational, and supportive role to multiple related projects, create informatics and data management solutions to allow easy usability of the collection, utilize informatics solutions to dovetail and federate with databases and data management tools used by related projects, and maintain flexibility in order to expand as needed to accomplish Human genetics and genomic research aims for the NINDS.<br />The scope of the project requirement includes: <br />&bull; Continued maintenance, storage, tracking and distribution of the current collection of all biologic materials collected under the predecessor and current contracts;<br />&bull; Providing adequate cold storage facilities and equipment for securing, processing, storing, tracking, cataloging, and distributing biological samples following Biospecimen Repository Best Practices as defined by the International Society of Biological and Experimental Repositories (ISBER https://www.isber.org/page/BPR). Other examples of biorepositories best practices include those from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), available at https://biospecimens.cancer.gov/bestpractices/;<br />&bull; Receiving, processing, storing, tracking and distributing of new samples and data from ~ 2,000 unique individuals expected to be received over two years; <br />&bull; Developing and performing, and maintaining Quality Assurance/Quality Control System for the facility, operations, stored biological samples, shipping materials, and personnel in accordance with all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations;<br />&bull; Culling samples based on sample condition and scientific needs to increase the value of the sample collection;<br />&bull; Providing a secure back-up system and a plan for disaster recovery;<br />&bull; Providing and maintaining searchable web-based interfaces to display inventory, associated phenotypic data, and other data portal activities to support the NINDS repository functions; and<br />&bull; Developing and implementing a transition plan to ensure proper documentation and transfer of stored biological samples at the conclusion of the performance period or upon request by the NINDS.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left; margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; line-height: 16.8pt;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">1. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Human Systems Division (AFLCMC/WNU) is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to respond to the requirements listed in this document. AFLCMC/WNU is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to explore cost effective options to provide this capability. This is an RFI only in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. </span></p>
<p>2. AFLCMC/WNU is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>3. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this RFI in order to assist AFLCMC/WNU in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages.</p>
<p>4. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the FedBizOps site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.</p>
<p>5. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation. It does not commit the government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.<br />6. The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition. If it is a small business set-aside, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting will apply. Note that, if there is sufficient demonstrated interested and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. If this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>7. Companies may be contacted if we need further information to fully understand the marketplace.</p>
<p>Performance Requirements:<br />The Air Force Uniform Office (AFUO) is conducting market research for any fabrics suitable for use in the Air Force physical training gear including base, mid, and outer layers. The AFUO is seeking firms with the capability to provide suitable fabrics for use in athletic shirts, shorts, pants, jackets, pullovers, and compression wear. The materials sought may include characteristics and finishes such as breathability, moisture wicking, water repellency, and antimicrobial as listed in Table I and II. Fabric shall exhibit suitable stretch as appropriate for each end item, have a desirable soft hand, and have no dry hand snagging upon touch. Any fabrics with finishes, inherent characteristics, or technologies not listed will also be considered so long as they improve the function of the end item for which they are intended. Fabrics may be of any knit or woven construction. AFUO is looking for expressions of interest and capability statements. Only Berry Amendment compliant materials/capabilities or Berry waivered materials and information should be submitted.</p>
<p>Response Guidance:<br />Please provide a white paper and technical data sheets describing your capabilities and why you believe your product's attributes will best meet the needs previously outlined as well as the requirements listed in Table I and II below. Please include a small sample (12"x12") of proposed material(s). Respondents should include a description of the company's background, experience, and any other information that demonstrates value, performance, and capabilities. As white papers are received and reviewed, the Government may request additional materials and/or information. Please submit responses by (31 January 2019) to the point of contact (POC) identified below.</p>

C. Scope of Services
1. The vendor s pharmacies will fill and dispense prescriptions that are written by a VA provider assigned to one of the CBOCs located throughout VISN 10. The pharmacies will also fill prescriptions written by providers contracted by the VA to provide patient care services. Prescriptions written by non-VA providers require pre-authorization by designated VA pharmacy staff. Each participating VA facility will be responsible for providing and maintaining the list of designated pharmacy staff with the ability to provide pre-authorizations.
2. The operating hours of most VA facilities and CBOCs are 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday-Friday, excluding federal holidays. There are clinics with expanded operating hours including Saturdays. The vendor s pharmacies will be available to fill prescriptions Monday through Friday during operating hours.  A minimum of one pharmacy shall be available to fill prescriptions on Monday -Saturday from 9:00 a.m. until a minimum of 9 p.m.
3. Prescriptions will be written on a VA prescription form (or electronic equivalent).  At the discretion of the VA facility or CBOC, prescriptions may also be faxed.  VA beneficiaries will be identified as being approved for prescription services via this contract by a specific card, voucher, or other system mutually agreed upon by the VA and the vendor.  Prescriptions written under this contract are only good for 48 hours.  With continuously changing technology, the potential for electronic submission will be discussed annually with the vendor.
4. Prescriptions will be filled and dispensed only for medications listed on a formulary.  Any medications not listed on the formulary require pre-authorization by designated VA pharmacy staff prior to filling.  Each VA facility will be responsible for the creation and maintenance of their formulary list.  The VA may update the formulary list as needed without contract modification.
5. Prescriptions will be filled and dispensed only for medications written by providers authorized by the VA.  Each VA facility will be responsible for the creation and maintenance of their provider list. A process will be established with the vendor to add, remove, and/or change provider information, as needed, without modification of the contract.

<p>Description: <br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) (hereinafter Notice). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, request for bids or quotations, nor, a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. The purpose of this RFI is for the Government to increase our knowledge of and obtain information from the tax return preparation software industry for project planning purposes. The IRS will utilize the RFI to identify solutions and approaches that currently exist in the marketplace and compile innovative ideas or concepts regarding the service in question.</p>
<p>The IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance/Tax Counseling for the Elderly (VITA/TCE) Programs provide free electronic federal, state and local tax return preparation and transmission for taxpayers. The VITA/TCE Programs use commercial off the shelf (COTS) tax preparation software to prepare these tax returns. The software is used by preparers with varying degrees of experience including tax professionals and non-tax professionals. This includes IRS partners, volunteers, employees, (referred to hereafter as IRS licensees) and taxpayers at approximately 12,000 volunteer sites worldwide, with diverse technical operating environments.</p>
<p>We wish to identify software and customer service capabilities that meet the unique needs of the VITA/TCE Programs.</p>

This includes the capability to electronically prepare the following 1040 Series Family Forms - 1040, 1040NR, 1040NREZ, 1040PR, and 1040X.</p>
<p>&bull; Method for the software to function as Web-Based, Self-Preparer Web-Based, and Desktop Version.</p>
<p>&bull; No limit as to the number of local, state, and federal tax returns that can be filed per licensed copy.</p>
<p>&bull; A disaster recovery, business continuity plan in the event of a catastrophic event (e.g. natural disasters, technological failures, human threats, etc.).</p>
<p>&bull; Capability to re-establish IRS licensees' data files to a condition that existed no more than 2 hours before the interruption in the event of system failures or facility disasters to prevent loss of data and provide business continuity.</p>
<p>&bull; Software that provides for reporting capability at the site level. The software shall provide the ability for appropriately authorized users to create and run customized (also called "ad hoc") management reports, based on a selection of data fields.</p>
<p>&bull; A website, toll-free telephone number, email and chat help desk to support volunteer sites. The help desk will provide timely issue resolution to the licensee sites and detailed reporting to the IRS. Help desk support is defined as assistance that provides successful resolution of questions relating to software/hardware compatibility and functionality issues of the Contractor's software. This includes providing support for trouble-shooting technical issues related to the installation and operation of the software (hardware, printers, etc.).</p>
<p>&bull; A method to mass-communicate with licensees regarding outages, planned/unplanned maintenance, and other relevant issues twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. (i.e. email, website availability, etc.).</p>

The internal medicine residents will provide medical care to NIAID clinical research adult and pediatric inpatients as assigned by the NIAID Clinical Director or designee at the NIH Clinical Center, located in Bethesda, Maryland.<br />The contractor will assign four medical residents every day of the week and is responsible for coordinating with the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) the planned start and end dates of each resident rotation. In addition, the contractor will ensure that the medical residents:<br />&bull; Initially rotates for no less than 28 consecutive days. Additional rotations after this period may be for less than the 28 consecutive days; <br />&bull; Assigned in June of each year is a PGY-2 resident.<br />&bull; If absent from their scheduled on-call shift or any absence exceeding 24 hours, be replaced with a credentialed resident, which must be coordinated with the COR or designee.</p>

<p>EMSL's Call for FY20 Proposals will be open January 9, 2019 - March 4, 2019 for high-impact user research proposals focused on selected topics in environmental molecular science. Approved proposals will be granted access to EMSL resources beginning October 1, 2019. Proposals submitted under this Call are valid for two years provided the annual summary and extension request demonstrate sufficient progress toward the stated goals. A select number of proposal authors may be invited to submit project plans to extend the work for a third year. Through the proposal and review process, EMSL allocates access to research instruments, staff, and facility services. Access to instruments is typically provided at no cost to users for research that is in the public domain and intended for publication in the open literature, but users are responsible for funding their own team's labor and travel expenses. Details related to focused topics under the Call will be available on EMSL's website on January 9 (https://www.emsl.pnl.gov/emslweb/annual-and-special-calls).</p>

<DESC>FICUS Research
<p>Applications for collaborative research with the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) and the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) are being accepted from January 9, 2019 to March 20, 2019. This call is part of the Facilities Integrating Collaborations for User Science program (FICUS) - a collaboration between user facilities that are stewarded by the Department of Energy Office of Biological and Environmental Research. FICUS was established to encourage and enable researchers to more easily integrate the expertise and capabilities of multiple user facilities into their research. The FICUS call between EMSL and JGI represents a unique opportunity for researchers to combine the power of genomics and molecular characterization in one proposed research project. <br /><br />FICUS applications follow a proposal package guidance, schedule, and review process that is tailored to meet the requirements of the facilities involved. Applications begin with Letters of Intent (LOI), and requests for full proposals will be issued by April 5, 2019 and due on May 5, 2019. Returning users especially are advised to carefully review the unique elements of this joint program as some of the procedures have changed. Details related to the Call will be available on EMSL's website on January 9 (https://www.emsl.pnl.gov/emslweb/call-letters-intent-fy2018-ficus-research-jgi-and-emsl).</p>

It is noted that necessary plumbing and electrical connections will first need to be installed to service the various kitchenette locations. Availability of a jury room is dictated by the court's need schedule.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<p>The Open Period for January* is January 1, 2019 to January 7, 2019, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2019 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 19-REG02 and must be located within Region 2.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2018, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2019 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY19 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

Civil site work will include new walkways, new parking areas, storm water management systems, and landscaping. All exterior service and/or maintenance pads, pavements, or construction directly associated with the facility utility systems will be included as part of this project. All furnishings, fixtures and equipment for the entire facility will be required to include offices, work areas, and conference rooms.

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement

The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Service Area
Office   Central (SAOC), is seeking sources for Tele Intensive Care (Tele-ICU) Program implementation and sustainment for all VHA medical centers. 

CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS:
VA/VHA/SAOC
212 3rd Ave South
Suite 29
Minneapolis, MN 55401

INTRODUCTION:
In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10 Market Research, the Department of Veterans Affairs is conducting market research to ascertain concerns that have the 
technical capability to provide for Tele Intensive Care (Tele-ICU) Program implementation and sustainment for VHA medical centers located throughout the nation.    This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be constructed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract.

BACKGROUND:
The National Tele-ICU Program has implemented a Virtual ICU to enable improved patient care through remote intensivist expertise and alerting algorithms based upon large population patient management experience.  There are currently two CORES, four Sub-Hubs, and thirty-eight Medical Centers consisting of a total of over four hundred thirty-eight intensive care beds, and over ninety other inpatient beds of coverage.  The program is continuing to expand and provide support and coverage to VHA facilities in need of their services.  

The Virtual ICU is a fully integrated medical application used by physician and nurses to increase access to critical care specialty medicine for veterans.  The application is integrated with audio/video conferencing equipment, the hospitals electronic medical record application, bedside physiologic monitoring system, and clinical information system.  The medical application required by the VA Tele-ICU Program must provide a consolidated summary and analysis of patient(s) using data from integrated systems and algorithms derived from previous research.  

Currently, there are over one thousand six hundred (1600) Intensive Care beds in the VA, leaving over one thousand beds that do not have Tele ICU coverage.  Currently, a unique contract is required for each implementation and additional support. 

With the creation of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) procurement vehicle to allow for the Tele-ICU program to procure equipment and services at an efficient rate will have numerous benefits to the program.  The high volume of separates contracts has resulted in lost opportunity for cost reduction, capturing standardization opportunities, increasing the number of purchase orders, quality consistency risk resulting in potential patient care issues, and the procurement lead time has been increased to ordering open market items.

SOURCES SOUGHT:
The purpose of this sources sought is to identify possible companies with the experience and capability of becoming a committed source for the Tele-ICU Program and its accompanied medical technology including but not limited to, medical software and licensing, medical hardware, implementation and installation services, and sustainment.  The Department of Veterans Affairs is looking to identify companies who can provide this technology and services for the entire Tele-ICU Program under one contract. The North American Industry Classification Code for this acquisition The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 334510. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response to this Sources Sought Notice. The Government reserves the right to use any information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate, including using technical information provided by respondents in any resultant solicitation. 

SUBMISSION DETAILS:

<DESC>The United States Air Force (USAF) Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Global Positioning Systems Directorate (SMC/GP), Contracting Office (PKL), Peterson Air Force Base, CO intends to release a solicitation and to negotiate the continued GPS Ground segment sustainment support as risk mitigation is required since the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) initial operational capability has been delayed beyond the need date for the first launch of GPS III Space Vehicle 01 (SV01). GPS III satellites are currently being built for SMC by Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC).<br /><br />There are approximately two dozen system modifications underway or in the planning stage to modernize the existing GPS Control Segment, the Architecture Evolution Program (AEP).  These modifications address known critical requirement shortfalls in operational capability and cybersecurity areas needed to support the launch and control of the next generation of GPS III satellites scheduled for May 2018.  One of the modifications currently on-going is the Contingency Flight Operations (COps) which requires a modification of AEP's operational Kalman filter.  This modification requires integration with LMSSC-developed GPS III test tools for upload generation, an upload capability through LMSSC's Launch and Checkout Capability (LCC) or through AEP, and the tracking of legacy GPS III signals using the existing GPS monitoring stations.&nbsp;
<p><br />SMC/GP believes that, due to its unique position as the sustainer of AEP, developer and operator of the GPS III Launch and Checkout Capability and developer of GPS III satellites, only LMSSC is capable of performing this work, in accordance with only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. SMC/GP intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to LMSSC for a seven year Sustainment Support Services contract to begin January 2019.  The envisioned contract action will be structured to continue and conclude those efforts without impacting current critical GPS space and control activities in support of ongoing U.S. and coalition warfighter operations.<br /> <br />A. Background: <br /> <br />The GCS II sustainment contract is the vehicle the GPS program sustainment organization (SMC/GPL) will use to satisfy the program director's vision and mission.  SMC/GPL is chartered to ensure the Operational Control Segment (OCS) viability until the next generation control segment (OCX) effort completes development and is fielded.  This contract provides organization and depot maintenance services to the operational unit.  It encompasses, but is not limited to, hardware maintenance, software releases, technical documentation, system administration, cybersecurity, special studies, data collection and anomaly response.<br /> <br />GCS II will provide sustainment functions for the GPS Control Segment which includes the Master Control Station (MCS), Alternate Master Control Station (AMCS), GPS Support Facility (GSF), four Ground Antennas (GA), six Monitor Stations (MS), Positional Training Emulator (PTE), GPS Information Network (GIN), Telecommunications Simulator Test Station (TSTS), Consolidated Test Environment (CTE) located at the following locations:  Schriever AFB (MCS, GSF, PTE, MS, GIN), Vandenberg AFB (AMCS, LADO Backup, GIN), Kwajalein (GA, MS), Ascension (GA, MS), Diego Garcia (GA, MS), Cape Canaveral (GA, MS), Hawaii (MS), and Colorado Springs CO (CTE). <br /> <br />B. Requirements<br /> <br />This effort includes providing operations and maintenance support on the test-bed/training suite located at the contractor's facility and operational systems located around the world.  The Contractor provides program management, risk management, safety and quality management; systems engineering; hardware and software maintenance; baseline configuration and data management; Technical Order management; planning, design, test, and evaluation for all system baseline upgrades due to new satellite platforms and preplanned system upgrades; programmed depot maintenance; emergency depot level maintenance; operator and maintainer training; system anomaly tracking, investigation and resolution; system trending analysis; equipment and software license obsolescence management; cybersecurity and processing of information assurance activities for network certification and accreditation.<br /> <br />Qualified sources must demonstrate the ability to deliver this capability with minimal investment by the Government. Qualified sources must additionally demonstrate all of the following capabilities:<br /> <br />(1) A thorough understanding of the GPS PNT mission, including Kalman filters, message generation and upload, message and signal types, and signal monitoring.<br /> <br />(2) A thorough understanding of the GPS II and III payloads, including their interfaces as well as their upload and download message formats.<br /> <br />(3) A thorough understanding of and demonstrated performance in delivering satellite control systems with the highest levels of Cybersecurity protections.<br /> <br />(4) Extensive systems engineering experience, knowledge, and background dealing with PNT systems, including system requirements analysis, test and verification, risk management, and system Cybersecurity management.<br /> <br />(5) Software and hardware maintenance, including installation and testing of all upgrades on a 24/7 schedule, as required, for the GPS Support Facility (GSF).  The GSF provides an environment for crew recurring and positional certification training, integration of new software releases and software maintenance updates into the operational baseline, completion of level 1 software maintenance activities, and associated configuration management/control of these tasks.

<DESC>This is a notice to announce a Request for Project Proposal (RFPP) through the Sensors, Communications, and Electronics Consortium (SCEC) for the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) Sensors prototype effort.
<p>The Army is developing the NGCV, which provides combat vehicle overmatch in close combat against the pacing threat.  In support of NGCV, CERDEC NVESD requires development, automation, integration, testing, and demonstration of various intelligent sensor prototypes to provide improved situational awareness, threat detection, targeting, and target hand-off capabilities.  Different sensor types are required to provide these capabilities and must demonstrate interoperability within a surrogate vehicle system for a proof of concept system of systems demonstration.</p>
<p>The Army's NGCV requires multiple intelligent sensor systems working together, mounted on a surrogate vehicle, that are ruggedized and interoperable using a common architecture for static and on-the-move applications.  A teaming arrangement of vendors is expected to design and develop intelligent sensor prototypes that provide enhanced capabilities as part of a combined arms team in the future operating environment.  It is anticipated that each intelligent sensor technology prototype capability will be developed independently with compatibility and synchronization performed by an Intelligent Sensor Integrator to insure interoperability.  One of the high level objectives of the program is to develop improved sensors, with automated capabilities to reduce workload and improve detection of threats, at an accelerated pace compared to conventional acquisition timelines.  CERDEC NVESD requires design and development of prototypes (as identified in Attachment 0001- SOO) that demonstrate advanced sensor suites, algorithms and processing and will be integrated first in a laboratory environment and followed by integration on up to three (3) manned and up to three (3) unmanned vehicles.</p>
<p>Please be aware that the enclosed SOO is unclassified, however, certain documents/specifications for this project announcement are marked Distribution C, "For Official Use Only (FOUO)."  For an SCE Consortium member to receive these FOUO documents, a DD Form 2345 must be on file with the SOSSEC Inc. Data Custodian, Debra Paine (dpaine@sossecinc.com), to enable receipt of FOUO documents related to this project.</p>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of the Program Manager Soldier Weapons, is releasing this Special Notice to reaffirm the intent to award a follow-on production contract or transaction in accordance with U.S. 10 Section 2371b(f) for the Squad- Fire Control (S-FC) prototype development effort, and to clarify the magnitude of the potential follow-on production transaction or contract. The Government anticipates awarding a Section 815 prototype project under the Department of Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) Technology Sub-objective WPN-19-34, which was competitively solicited under Request for Ordnance Technology Initiatives (ROTI) 19-01. Upon successful completion of the prototype project, the Government anticipates the award of a follow-on production contract or transaction of approximately 30,000 units to support the Next Generation Squad Weapon - Automatic Rifle (NGSW-AR) and Next Generation Squad Weapon - Rifle (NGSW-R) without further competition. Industry members, including those not part of National Armaments Consortium, who feel they can provide a solution for Squad Fire Control may provide evidence for consideration. Evidence must support the contractor's claim that they can provide a solution that addresses the DOTC Sub-objective WPN-19-34 listed below.<br /><br />Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether the Government can conduct a competitive procurement after completion of the prototype project, or whether it will utilize the authority of 10 Section 2371b(f). Please note that information received will not affect the selection decision under WPN-19-34. A determination not to compete this follow-on procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The Government may determine to release a separate solicitation for the Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) fire control if it is believed to be within the Government's best interests. <br /><br />The Squad - Fire Control's (S-FC) prototyping objective is to provide a ruggedized fire control that increases accuracy and lethality for the dismounted warfighter on the battlefield. Capabilities are achieved through integration of advanced technologies to provide a fire control system consisting of a direct view optic, ballistic calculator, atmospheric sensor suite, and laser range finder. Combining these features with an in-scope digital overlay produces an adjusted aim-point for the Soldier within the field of view. The S-FC program has been selected to fulfill the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) program's Increment I fire control requirement. The system will provide the weapon system an accurate range to target along with an adjusted aim point for the selected weapon/ammunition combination. S-FC prototypes will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) for development with the NGSW-Automatic Rifle (AR) and NGSW-Rifle (R) programs.<br /><br />This is not a notice for a solicitation, nor is it a request for proposals or whitepapers. This Special Notice is to advise interested members of the National Armaments Consortium (NAC), as well as other interested members within the U.S. technology base, that the Government anticipates award of a follow-on production contract or transaction accordance with U.S. 10 Section 2371b(f) for the Squad-Fire Controls (S-FC) prototype, contingent on the successful completion of the prototype projects previously submitted, but not yet selected, under WPN-19-34. Per the memorandum issued by the Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, Definitions and Requirements for Other Transactions Under Title 10, United States Code, Section 2371b, dated 20 November 2018, successful completion is defined as the written determination of the appropriate approving official for the matter in question that efforts conducted under a Prototype OT: (1) met the key technical goals of a project; (2) satisfied success metrics incorporated into the Prototype OT; or (3) accomplished a particularly favorable or unexpected result that justifies the transition to production. Furthermore, successful completion can occur prior to the conclusion of a prototype project to allow the Government to transition any aspect of the prototype project determined to provide utility into production while other aspects of the prototype project have yet to be completed.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DOTC Sub-objective WPN-19-34:</span></strong><br /><strong>(U) Prototype:</strong> The prototype being developed is a physical model of squad fire control devices to evaluate the technical feasibility, manufacturing feasibility, and military utility to mature technology and manufacturing of fire control devices for the infantryman. The expected prototype deliverable quantity is 10. The feasibility of the prototype will be demonstrated/tested by both the Government and the Contractor. The prototype is applicable to M4A1 Carbine, squad designated marksmen - rifle, and Next Generation Carbine. <br /><br /><strong>(U) Requirement:</strong> The Government is seeking proposals for the development of ruggedized advanced fire control devices. Prototypes shall build upon an already developed fire control solution that is at a Test Readiness Level - 7. The Government defines TRL-7 as successfully completing a System prototype demonstration in an operational environment. The prototype shall be near or at planned operational system. The Government intends for a 12 month period of performance which shall produce prototypes for use in an operational test environment. Solutions shall be capable of meeting environmental requirements as defined in MIL-STD-810G Change 1. The weapon optics shall include a direct view optic with digital overlay display, laser range finder, ballistic calculator, and atmospheric sensor suite. Digital imagers shall be supplementary to, not in lieu of, primary weapon optics in order to ensure Soldier capabilities in a no-power environment. The system shall provide a fire control solution that provides an adjusted aim point, or disturbed reticle to the user for increased accuracy and lethality on the battlefield. Size, weight, power, and cost will all be considerations in proposal selection. Total system weight must not exceed 2lbs while incorporating direct view optic, digital imager, batteries, and any ancillary processors or sensors. If weight exceeds 2lbs, a discussion of capability trade space must be included.<br /><br />The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement. Contractors must have a current registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) http://www.sam.gov.<br /><br />Responses must be received NLT 11:59 am Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 21 January 2019.

<DESC>December 21, 2018
<p><br />Dear Industry Partner,</p>
<p>This is to advise the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contractor community of the DHS plans regarding actions that may be necessary in the event that contract funding is affected by a lapse in appropriations.</p>
<p>As you are aware, a full year appropriation has not been enacted for the current fiscal year and the current continuing resolution expires today, which may result in a lapse in the funds designated to purchase certain supplies and services, as well as a reduction in the Government's capacity to administer DHS contracts. As a consequence, certain planned procurements may be cancelled or postponed and certain existing contracts may be delayed, stopped, reduced in scope, or terminated. Additionally, contract invoice payments may be delayed. Contractors will be notified once funding is available and the Government has returned to normal operations.</p>
<p>Should DHS determine that any of these actions are necessary, if a lapse occurs, the contracting officer for each affected contract will promptly provide appropriate notice to the contractor counterpart in accordance with the terms and conditions of the affected contract. The notice will contain the direction necessary to adjust the contract due to the lapse in the appropriations.</p>
<p>If a contract will not be affected at the onset of the lapse in appropriations, DHS does not plan to provide any separate notifications or communications of that fact. Unless the contracting officer provides a formal notification to the contrary, all DHS contractors must continue to comply with all terms, conditions, requirements and deliveries specified in their contract(s).</p>
<p>We appreciate your continued partnership supporting DHS's mission during this funding uncertainty.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Soraya Correa<br />Chief Procurement Officer</p>

<p>Issue Date: 21 DEC 2018 - Closing Date: 11 JAN 2019 2:00 PM EST</p>
<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Crane intends to extend a current Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure M72E8 Light Anti-Armor Weapon (LAW) Fire from Enclosure (FFE) test rounds, M72E10 LAW FFE Anti-Structure Munition (ASM) test rounds, special LAW FFE test rounds, and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantities of the M72 LAW A8 and A10.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for the supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source, to NAMMO Talley, Inc., Mesa, Arizona, under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is because the M72A8 LAW FFE and M72A10 LAW FFE ASM are fully developed items with safety and performance requirements currently being substantiated via an extensive Government test program.  Similar systems exist but they were determined to be too large, not meet performance requirements, or are not capable of being safely fired from a confined space when the initial requirement became known to the Government. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of testing, procurement, evaluation, and certification costs, which is not expected to be recovered through competition. Responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this source sought is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC><div>N00164-19-S-NB34 BROAD AREA CRADA ANNOUNCEMENT (BACA) FOR COLLABORATION OPPORTUNITIES IN "Counter Unmanned Arial Systems Threat Library Collaboration and Enhanced Video Processing Algorithm Test and Evaluation"</div>
<div><br />QUALIFICATION - PSC 5855 - NAICS 334413<br />ISSUE DATE 21 DEC 2019 - CLOSING DATE 30 JAN 2019 - TIME 2:00PM EASTERN</div>
<div><br />Special Notice</div>
<div><br />Synopsis:</div>
<div><br />The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane), through its Electro-Optic Technology Division is the DoD's Recognized Expert in Full-Spectrum, Multi-Domain EO/IR Solutions, and Test and Evaluation Capability Across the Lifecycle.  Additionally, the Electro-Optic Technology Division collaborates with academia and industry on projects that create jointly beneficial partnerships.  NSWC Crane is interested in joint research and development in the characterization, test, and evaluation of Counter UAS threat libraries on multiple host platform sensors.  NSWC Crane seeks Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) partners that possess the expertise, capabilities, facilities for the manufacturing and prototyping of Electro-Optic, and Infrared Sensors.  CRADA partners must have experience in the following areas to explore R&amp;D opportunities with the Electro-Optic Technology Division:</div>
<div><br />1.	Evaluation of video processor algorithm's ability to detect, identify, and track small commercial UAS. Must be able to provide full formal descriptions of objective function(s) that meet formal criteria for a metric.</div>
<p>2.	Ability to fuse sensor data from radar and electro-optic sensors to detect, identify, and track small commercial UAS.<br /> <br />3.	Validate modular open systems architecture (MOSA) for integration into a Government Command and Control software suite according to evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>This synopsis serves as a sources sought for CRADA participants and seeks information from companies capable of providing expertise, capabilities, facilities and experience in any of these fields and applications with respect to a CRADA effort.  Any group that believes it has the ability to perform collaboration with NSWC Crane in these areas can identify its capabilities by submitting the information to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Chief Technology Office (Code 00T), Attn: Mrs. Jenna Dix, Bldg 2036, 300 Hwy 361, Crane, IN 47522 or jenna.dix@navy.mil.</p>
<p>Responses are requested by close of business January 30, 2019. After reviewing the responses, NSWC Crane may request a meeting or teleconference with responding parties to gain further insight into their capabilities. NSWC Crane is not obligated to hold these meetings with any or all respondents. If NSWC Crane decides to meet with a party, it will only meet with those that responded to this notice. NSWC Crane will not reimburse costs for participation in these meetings or teleconferences.  NSWC Crane reserves the right to enter into CRADA agreements with no, any or all respondents based upon NSWC Crane's judgment of the potential success of collaborative efforts.</p>
<p>There may be a future acquisition directed to some or all of the capabilities which are the subject or focus of this research and development effort. Therefore NSWC Crane desires to avoid or mitigate unfair competitive advantages being conferred on any potential contractor or offeror as a result of CRADA efforts herein which actually or appear to compromise the integrity of the procurement process.  In particular, NSWC Crane seeks to avoid or mitigate (1) -unequal access to information on Government needs and Warfighter evaluations of proprietary systems or improved versions resulting from this CRADA effort; (2) -impaired objectivity arising from CRADA partners' collaborative efforts with Government employees or Warfighters; and (3) -biased ground rules for a possible or potential future acquisition directed to a capability which may be a focus of this CRADA effort.  This effort is expected to produce CRADA subject data deliverables which may be used to facilitate a possible follow-on acquisition using a Name Brand or Equal acquisition strategy, which is designed to ensure a fair competition while respecting the proprietary rights and previous investment of potential CRADA partners.</p>
<p>This is not a procurement, nor a notice for such a procurement, and at this time there is no plan or funding for a follow-on procurement. The legal authority for this cooperative research effort is the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986, codified in Title 15 United States Code, Section 3710a, et seq. Under a CRADA, the partner contributes funds, equipment, or in-kind services to the joint research effort, leveraging their efforts with those of the federal agency for a mission-related objective.  At Government discretion, subject data deliverables and inventions delivered under any CRADA agreement may be used in future competitive acquisitions.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a fixed-price purchase order on a single source basis to Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services, LLC, 7400 South Alton Court, Englewood, CO, 80112-2395, for license to obtain, use and store CUSIP data, including CUSIP numbers and descriptions, in electronic format. The CUSIP system is a standard numbering and descriptive methodology utilized throughout the financial community for identifying securities. The Contracting Officer has determined that Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services, LLC is the only source that can reasonably meet the SEC's requirement in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b) because Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services, LLC is the only known source that allows the user to license access directly with them in order to store CUSIP data within their own systems. In addition, the SEC requires access to the data via a specific platform, for which a license direct with Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services, LLC is required.
<p>The anticipated period of performance will be a base period of 12 months with four (4) option periods.</p>
<p>The SEC intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b). Interested sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which will be considered by the agency. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in preparation of statements, proposals, or quotations. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation or additional information will be made available with regard to this sole source notice.</p>

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers New England District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following construction project:
<p>A complete comprehensive rehabilitation of Buildings 1107 and 1109 to house the New England District Headquarters on Hanscom Air Force Base, MA. The facility has been designed taking into account the project requirements, existing facility conditions, and project constraints to provide the best possible operational, sustainable, and cost effective facility. Functional areas within the building will include administrative office areas, conference rooms, a mail room, a law library, break rooms, an emergency operations center, a reservoir control center, shower and locker rooms, geotechnical and environmental labs, a training room, file storage area and support spaces.</p>
<p>The project consists of the renovation of approximately 100,000 square feet. The renovations will consist of: interior demolition and construction; hazardous materials abatement; roof replacement; window replacement; full mechanical, electrical, and plumbing system upgrades; restroom removal and construction; security system replacement; and full fire protection upgrades. Progressive collapse structural reinforcement of the 3-story building (1109) will also be required. There is a 3-story addition with basement between the buildings that will be utilized for the main entry, the Emergency Operations Center, 2 elevators, a communicating stairway, conference rooms, restrooms, and break areas with small kitchenette areas. Civil site work will include new walkways, new parking areas, storm water management systems, and landscaping. All exterior service and/or maintenance pads, pavements, or construction directly associated with the facility utility systems will be included as part of this project. All furnishings, fixtures and equipment for the entire facility will be required to include offices, work areas, and conference rooms. The rehabilitation will include finished pathways in the basements of Building 1107 and Building 1109 (corridors, corridors doors, walls, lighting, HVAC, etc.) and access control in all areas (floors, stairwells, elevators, basement corridors.</p>
<p><br />This project involves civil, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, structural, geotechnical, and architectural disciplines. Existing site electrical, water, sewer, gas, telecom, and drainage are available and shall be connected to the new building.</p>
<p><br />A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>a. Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>b. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.</p>
<p>c. The complexity of the project.</p>
<p>d. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.</p>
<p>e. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.</p>
<p>f. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.</p>
<p>g. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.</p>
<p>h. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.</p>
<p>i. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described Construction Project? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the construction project?</p>
<p>b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?

<DESC>Title:<br />FUNWAVE
<p>Description(s):</p>
<p>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Contracting Office has a requirement for validation of FUNWAVE-TVD vessel model for use in simulations of ship-induced waves and assessment of their potential impacts to Sabine-to-Galveston (S2G) hurricane and flood protection systems (HFPS) along Sabine-Neches Waterways (SNWW). The ERDC intends to solicit and award on a brand name basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(1)b, to University of Delaware., 220 HULLIHEN HALL NEWARK, DE 19716 (Cage Code: 015X1). It has been determined that only one source is reasonably available. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541715 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology) - nanotechnology research and experimental development laboratories; Size Standard is 1000 Employees. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with regulations at FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>Nature and/or description of the action being approved:</p>
<p>Last year, the USACE began initial work on implementation of pressure source and a boundary integral (panel) method for modeling ship wakes in a phase-resolving numerical wave model FUNWAVE. A robust, computationally efficient numerical model is still needed to address the ship wake quantification problem on a long-term operational scale. The quantification of erosion of shorelines and riverbanks due to ship-generated waves is a ubiquitous concern in most navigation channels across the country, particularly problematic in shallow coastal waters and regions not exposed to large sea swells or impacts from large wind generated waves. As a steadily increasing number of crafts are put into service, predominantly passenger ferry traffic, more coastal regions are exposed to wash from vessel wakes, causing a growing concern with respect to public safety, potential damage of coastal structures, and the corresponding environmental impacts. The ERDC Coastal &amp; Hydraulics Lab (CHL) last year had the requirement for a follow on assessment to upgrade the current capabilities in FUNWAVE's ship-wake modeling module of FUNWAVE. These were to be implemented with modern programming paradigms to make use of distributed High Performance Computing in which the action was competed and awarded to the University of Delaware. The new requirement will be a follow on assessment to facilitate the ERDC's improvements in ship wake generation mechanism for the phase-resolving numerical wave-modeling framework and extend the quantification of their erosion effects on adjacent shorelines, especially as it pertains to large container-type vessels in the Sabine-to-Galveston (S2G) project with analysis of potential impacts on hurricane and flood protection systems (HFPS) in Sabine-Neches Waterways (SNWW). These activities and capabilities will add to CHL's expertise in the use of complex physics-based numerical models for the propagation and evolution on nearshore shallow-water waves, which were generated by large vessels in confined spaces. The improvements in ship wake modeling will deliver more robust quantification of coastal erosion/scour by long and energetic breaking waves. These capabilities should be implemented in the currently utilized open source phase-resolving wave model FUNWAVE, to allow for multiple vessels interacting in near and far field regimes, have multi-grid coupling, as well as moving grids following the vessels. These capabilities should be verified against existing field data for a cohort of vessel and hull types; in particular large vessels that can generate surge-type waves.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall implement large-vessel wake generation capabilities within the framework of the existing ship-wake module in FUNWAVE. These capabilities should work seamlessly in the latest releases (3.0+) of FUNWAVE-TVD for simple and complex vessel geometries; in particular for multiple vessels following prescribed navigation paths. In addition, validation work from the recent implementation of non-cohesive sediment transport libraries and morphology modules will be needed against field data.</p>
<p>The quantification of potential impacts of ship wakes effects on adjacent shorelines should be investigated with newly implemented sediment transport and morphology module. The current USACE sediment transport libraries, like SEDLIB are also heavily utilized across CHL-ERDC and are of direct interest. Two-way coupling framework, moving grids, and a two-layer module to address waves over permeable shorelines are vital for the project.</p>
<p>Finally, the Contractor shall provide written guidance (e.g., Technical Notes, Technical Report, Journal Publications) on usability and applicability guidance of the ship wake generation mechanism in FUNWAVE-TVD, as well as scour/erosion hot spots validation work. Bi-weekly project update calls and emails are requested, along with monthly progress reports in PDF electronic format. The technology transfer in the form of a hands-on workshop delivered at the USACE Galveston District should be the final focal point of the contract.</p>
<p>Contracting without providing for full and open competition under this acquisition may of be accomplished pursuant to the authority 13.501(a)(1) (ii) of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.</p>
<p>Demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:<br />FUNWAVE is a phase-resolving, time-stepping Boussinesq model for ocean surface wave propagation in the nearshore and is copyrighted under the terms of the GNU General Public License. The Funwave, theory and numerical implementation of the initial code, ERDC has current operational capabilities to since this is an open-source, copy left software. The new module will need to be by added to Funwave a ship-wake modeling module currently in use by the Lab, by implementing and adding the with modern programming paradigms to make use of distributed High Performance Computing (HPC) with Message Passing Interface (MPI) library the ship wake generation of ship-generated waves. The modules will need to be validated against existing and established physical model data and field measurements, as well as higher fidelity numerical models that will be heavily used, not only in the CHL Lab, but ERDC wide.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals. A solicitation will not be issued. Requests for copies of a solicitation in response to this notice will not be honored or acknowledged. All interested responsible sources who feel they are capable of fulfilling this requirement may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

The contractor must also provide a description of their past experience in fulfilling requirements which are the same or similar to this requirement and references for each. Any information submitted shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.</p>
<p>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the government not to compete this requirement on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Responses to this requirement shall be submitted to Robyn D. Wells at Robyn.D.Wells@usace.army.mil.

<DESC><p>On September 2017, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM Directorate of Procurement) awarded a sole source 5-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) to support USSOCOM Dismounted Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) Systems. The purpose of this notification is to inform industry of USSOCOM's intent to issue a procurement action to increase the contract ceiling on the current IDIQ from $205,000,000.00 to $410,000,000.00. The contract ceiling increase is required to support procurement orders for the Modi electronic countermeasure (ECM) system from USSOCOM, United States Army (USA), United States Marine Corps (USMC) and other government agencies. This opportunity to coordinate acquisition efforts allows all stakeholders to gain efficiencies through quantities-of-scale and collective developments and enhancements across the ECM user community. Delivery Orders to this IDIQ also include the following for Modi and Thor II systems:</p>
<p>- Sustainment and engineering support services;<br />- Procurement of new CREW systems;<br />- Loadset, software, and firmware development;<br />- Research and advanced technique development;<br />- Spare parts and ancillary equipment;<br />- Development of prototype auxiliary/subsystem equipment based on <br />emerging technologies;<br />- Upgrades and Service Life Extension Programs (SLEP) of systems;<br />- Training and field support;<br />- Support to mission critical and urgent requirements for Special Operations Forces.</p>
<p>After evaluation of the responses received to the Sources Sought issued 16 July 2016, USSOCOM has determined that, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), no other responsible source will satisfy agency requirements with the available technical data without incurring substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition. USSOCOM has not found additional sources since the 16 July 2016 posting which necessitates the intended ceiling increase to contract H92222-17-D-0023. Any questions or concerns regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via email to Ms. Erica Shaw, Contract Specialist (CTR), <a href="mailto:Erica.Shaw.ctr@socom.mil">Erica.Shaw.ctr@socom.mil</a>.</p>

In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b), this Notice of Intent is to inform all parties the Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 19 located at 6162 South Willow Drive Suite 300, Greenwood Village, CO 80111 intends to award a sole source procurement for the following requirement to the small business, Phoenix Seating Systems LLC, DBA Falcon Rehabilitation, located at 8245 Quebec Street, Commerce City, CO 80022:

Custom Powered Prone Carts/Stretchers

EA

The contracting action is for the acquisition of two (2) custom manual prone carts and two (2) custom powered prone carts. The unique feature that limits this request to just Falcon Rehabilitation is that they build their carts to allow for height adjustments on the frame to allow unique setups from patient to patient. This height adjustment is critical for the manually operated carts and the adjustment places the wheel rims at the desired distance for the patient s arm length to allow self-locomotion. The carts were configured based on proven setups at other VA Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) units that also have purchased from Falcon Rehabilitation. Additionally, the intent is to purchase both the powered and nonpowered carts from the same vendor for ease of maintenance and the mattresses or pads must be capable of being removed for cleaning and must be constructed of anti-bacterial properties. 

After much research, Falcon Rehabilitation is the only manufacturer that can build a prone cart that will meet the SCI unit needs. They make both and powered and nonpowered carts, the pads and mattress material that will come in contact with patients is made from an anti-bacterial material and is capable of being removed for a thorough cleaning in between patients. Lastly and critical for the intended purpose of the SCI unit is the ability to adjust the height of the frame on the carts for use from patient to patient.

The associated North America Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 339113 and the Small Business Size Standard is 750 Employees.

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, Friday, December 28th, 2018.  Information received in response to this notice must clearly demonstrate the capability of meeting the Government s need as stated above. Include any relevant information (specifications, cut sheets, brochures, capability statement, etc.) confirming the ability to supply the products and/or any services outlined in this notice. Responses to this notice are to be sent to stephen.heckman@va.gov.

A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government is not responsible for any potential costs incurred from interested parties desiring to respond to this notice.

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical with delivery as a sub factor and Past Performance. This will be a best value selection. 

1) Technically Acceptable - In order to be technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. 
Sub factor (a) Delivery - Offeror must be able to make the delivery and installation date requested in the RFQ. Delivery date will be April 16, 2019 which is 60 business days from anticipated award date, January 22, 2019. If award date is later than January 22. 2019 then the delivery date will be moved to 60 business days from the date of award. 

2) Past Performance - Please provide information on (3) past purchase orders similar to the scope and size of this requirement. 
The offeror's quote will be evaluated to determine the extent to which its past performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance in providing requirements similar in size, scope and complexity to the requirements identified in the RFQ. The evaluation will consider both the relevance and quality of past projects.  The Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).   The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources. The information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination. An Offeror without relevant past performance will receive a neutral rating (i.e., neither favorable nor unfavorable).   

The evaluation of Past Performance will reflect the consideration of all relevant agency/customer information that is available to the Government, including both the information received from the offeror's references and information obtained from other sources.

Technical, delivery, and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important than cost or price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Shoe Covers, Disposable. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<div><br /></div>
<div>These Shoe Covers, Disposable products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Shoe Covers, Disposable in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Shoe Covers, Disposable will be established approximately April 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately May 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Shoe Covers, Disposable. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Shoe Covers, Disposable.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A. Products &amp; Performance Required</div>
<div>The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Shoe Covers, Disposable. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $358,160. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Three items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100 % ($358,160) of the total volume in sales ($358,160). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>B. Instructions to Vendors</div>
<div>Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span></div>
<div>The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet</strong>.</div>
<div>1.	Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide date of application and DMM number proving access to the DMS, as the subsequent Standardization Action requires vendors to have all required items on DAPA.</div>
<div>2.	Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.</div>
<div>3.	Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.</div>
<div>4.	Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.&nbsp;</div>
<div>5.	<strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Ultrasound Probe Covers. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<div><br /></div>
<div>These Ultrasound Probe Covers products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Ultrasound Probe Covers in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Ultrasound Probe Covers will be established approximately April 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately May 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Ultrasound Probe Covers. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Ultrasound Probe Covers.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A. Products &amp; Performance Required</div>
<div>The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Ultrasound Probe Covers. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $574,363. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Thirteen items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 82.7% ($475,181) of the total volume in sales ($574,363). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>B. Instructions to Vendors</div>
<div>Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.</strong></div>

(End of Clause)<BR><BR>(a) U.S. and Coalition Commanders possess inherent authority to maintain law and order, provide security, and impose discipline necessary to protect the inhabitants of U.S. and/or Coalition installations, U.S. and Coalition personnel operating outside of installations, and U.S. or Coalition-funded developmental projects in Afghanistan. This authority allows commanders to administratively and physically control access to installations and/or project sites, and to bar contracts – including prime contractors, subcontractors at any tier, and any employees, from an installation or site. A commander’s inherent force protection (FP) authority is independent of an agency’s contracting authority, and it may not be superseded by any contractual term or provision. 

(b) The prime Contractor/Vendor acknowledges that: submission of a bid, offer, or a proposal; acceptance of contract award of any type; or continuing effort under any contract that includes this clause; requires that the prime Contractor/Vendor, and all subcontractors under any affected contracts be initially eligible – and remain eligible during the entire period of contract performance to include any warrant period – for installation access to a U.S. and/or Coalition installation, regardless of whether the performance will take place on or off a U.S. or Coalition installation. 

(c) To be eligible for installation access, Contractors and subcontractors at all tiers are required to register for installation access in the Joint Contingency Contracting System (JCCS) and are responsible for keeping the information in the this system updated at all times. Prime Contractors and subcontractors at any tier may verify their registration at https://www.jccs.gov/jccscoe/ by selecting the “Vendors Login” module and logging in with their user name and password. The offeror must be registered, approved, and eligible for installation access prior to award, and remain eligible for installation access for the life of the contract.<BR><BR>(1) The offeror is required to submit a listing of all proposed subcontractors, at all tiers, to the contracting officer with the submission of the proposal, and provide updates during the life of the contract when subcontractors are added or removed. If no subcontractors are expected to perform during the life of the contract, the offeror must submit a negative response to the Contracting Officer with its proposal. After award, the prime contractor must submit a negative response to the contracting officer at the beginning of each performance period. 

(2) Failure to be approved in JCCS – and thereby be eligible for installation access at the Prime and subcontractor levels – or failure to inform the contracting officer of the names of all prospective subcontractors (or provide a negative reply), may render the offerors/contractor ineligible for award or continued performance. Additionally, any firm that is declared ineligible for installation access will be deemed non-responsible until such time as that firm is again deemed eligible by the appropriate access approval authority. 

(d) Installation access determinations arise from the Combatant Commander’s inherent authority and are separate and distinct from any law, regulation, or policy regarding suspension and debarment authority. Contractor queries or requests for reconsideration related to U.S. or Coalition installation base access eligibility must be directed to the authority responsible for base access decisions. 

(End of Clause)<BR><BR>(a) USFOR-A FRAGO 10-200. United States Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) has directed that all shipments into and out of the Combined Joint Operations Area - Afghanistan (CJOA-A) be coordinated through the Defense Transportation System (DTS) in order to expedite the customs clearance process and facilitate the use of in-transit visibility for all cargo in the CJOA-A 

(b) Information regarding the Defense Transportation System (DTS). For instructions on shipping commodity items via commercial means using DTS, see the following websites:

2. Defense Transportation Regulation – Part II 4 Cargo Movement – Cargo Routing and Movement: http://www.transcom.mil/dtr/part-ii/dtr_part_ii_202.pdf 

3. Defense Transportation Regulation – Part V - Department of Defense Customs and Border Clearance Policies and Procedures: http://www.transcom.mil/dtr/part-v/dtr_part_v_512.pdf
(c) Responsibilities of the vendor carrier representative, shipping expediter, and/or customs broker: 
1. Afghanistan Import Customs Clearance Request Procedures: The carrier, shipping expediter, and/or customs broker is responsible for being knowledgeable about the Afghan Customs Clearance Procedures. 

2. Status of Customs Clearance Requests: All inquiries regarding the status of a customs clearance request prior to its submission to Department of Defense (DoD) Customs and after its return to the carrier representative or shipping expediter should be directed to the carrier or shipping agent. 

3. Customs Required Documents: The carrier representative or shipping expediter is required to provide the DoD Contracting Officer Representative (COR) with all documentation that will satisfy the requirements of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA). 
(d) Required Customs Documents: Documents must be originals (or copies with a company stamp). Electronic copies or photocopied documents will not be accepted by GIRoA. The carrier is responsible for checking the current requirements for documentation with the Afghanistan Customs Department (ACD) as specified by the U.S. Embassy Afghanistan’s SOP for Customs Clearance Requests Operations (http://trade.gov/static/AFGCustomsSOP.pdf) and paragraph 4 below. 1. The U.S Ambassador Afghanistan diplomatic note guarantees that the U.S. Government (USG) shipments are exempt from Afghanistan Customs duties and taxes. USG shipments do not provide commercial carriers with the authority to unnecessarily delay shipments or holdover shipments in commercial storage lots and warehouses while enroute to its final destination. The U.S. Embassy expects that shipments will be expedited as soon as customs clearance paperwork is received from the respective GIRoA officials.<BR><BR>2. Imports: Documentation must list the year, make, model, and color of the commodity, the commodity Identification Number (if applicable) and for vehicles, the Engine Block Number. The following documentation is required for all import shipments:  An original Customs Clearance Request (CCR) prepared by the COR in accordance with Afghanistan customs guidance referenced in paragraph 4 below. 

a. Bills of Lading (for shipments by sea), Airway Bills (for shipments by air) or Commodity Movement Request (CMRs) (for overland shipments). In the consignee block, type in “US Military”. This will help the Afghan Customs officials to recognize that the shipment belongs to the US Military and, therefore, the shipment is subject to tax exemption provisions as specified under the current Diplomatic Note or Military Technical Agreement (MTA). 
b. Shipping Invoices. 
c. Packing Lists. Required only if the shipping invoice does not list the cargo. 
d. An Afghan Government Tax Exemption Form (Muaffi Nama) purchased from the Department of Customs and Revenue and prepared in the local language by the carrier representative, shipping agent, or customs broker. 
e. A Diplomatic Note, prepared by DoD Customs, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the initiation of customs formalities with the Ministry of Finance, Department of Customs and Exemptions. Please note that DoD Customs is not responsible for registering vehicles. 
f. Commercially-owned equipment such as vehicles, construction machinery or generators that are leased and imported to Afghanistan for the performance of a USG contract may be subject to taxes and duties as determined by GIRoA. If commercially-owned equipment is imported into Afghanistan in a duty-free status, that duty-free status only applies as long as the equipment is under the exclusive use of the USG contract. If the equipment is released at the end of the contract, applicable GIRoA duties and taxes will apply to the owner if the equipment is not exported from Afghanistan or transferred to another USG contract. 
g. USG-owned vehicles must be exported at the conclusion of the project period or transferred to another USG entity. Under certain conditions, the USG may transfer equipment or vehicles to GIRoA. 

3. Exports: The following documentation is required for all export shipments: 
a. An original CCR prepared by the COR. If COR is not available, the Contracting Officer (KO) will prepare the CCR. 
b. Invoices. 
c. Packing Lists. Required only if the shipping invoice does not list the cargo. 
d. A Diplomatic Note, prepared by the DoD Customs Cell, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the initiation of customs formalities with the Ministry of Finance, Department of Customs and Exemptions. 
4. Customs requirements from the GIRoA may change with little notice. For current detailed instructions on customs guidelines in Afghanistan, refer to “The Instruction for Customs Clearance Request (Import/Export) Operations.” In all cases, the carrier is required to obtain a copy of this document, found at the following link: http://trade.gov/static/AFGCustomsSOP.pdf<BR><BR>(a) Pursuant to the authority of USCENTCOM FRAGO’s 09-1567 and 10-143 this contract is awarded in Afghani (local currency), if awarded to a host nation vendor.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the
Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

NESC: http://www.standards.ieee.org/nesc<BR><BR>(a) U.S. and Coalition Commanders possess inherent authority to maintain law and order, provide security, and impose discipline necessary to protect the inhabitants of U.S. and/or Coalition installations, U.S. and Coalition personnel operating outside of installations, and U.S. or Coalition-funded developmental projects in Afghanistan. This authority allows commanders to administratively and physically control access to installations and/or project sites, and to bar contracts – including prime contractors, subcontractors at any tier, and any employees, from an installation or site. A commander’s inherent force protection (FP) authority is independent of an agency’s contracting authority, and it may not be superseded by any contractual term or provision. 

(b) The prime Contractor/Vendor acknowledges that: submission of a bid, offer, or a proposal; acceptance of contract award of any type; or continuing effort under any contract that includes this clause; requires that the prime Contractor/Vendor, and all subcontractors under any affected contracts be initially eligible – and remain eligible during the entire period of contract performance to include any warrant period – for installation access to a U.S. and/or Coalition installation, regardless of whether the performance will take place on or off a U.S. or Coalition installation. 

(c) To be eligible for installation access, Contractors and subcontractors at all tiers are required to register for installation access in the Joint Contingency Contracting System (JCCS) and are responsible for keeping the information in the this system updated at all times. Prime Contractors and subcontractors at any tier may verify their registration at https://www.jccs.gov/jccscoe/ by selecting the “Vendors Login” module and logging in with their user name and password. The offeror must be registered, approved, and eligible for installation access prior to award, and remain eligible for installation access for the life of the contract.<BR><BR>(1) The offeror is required to submit a listing of all proposed subcontractors, at all tiers, to the contracting officer with the submission of the proposal, and provide updates during the life of the contract when subcontractors are added or removed. If no subcontractors are expected to perform during the life of the contract, the offeror must submit a negative response to the Contracting Officer with its proposal. After award, the prime contractor must submit a negative response to the contracting officer at the beginning of each performance period. 

(2) Failure to be approved in JCCS – and thereby be eligible for installation access at the Prime and subcontractor levels – or failure to inform the contracting officer of the names of all prospective subcontractors (or provide a negative reply), may render the offerors/contractor ineligible for award or continued performance. Additionally, any firm that is declared ineligible for installation access will be deemed non-responsible until such time as that firm is again deemed eligible by the appropriate access approval authority. 

(d) Installation access determinations arise from the Combatant Commander’s inherent authority and are separate and distinct from any law, regulation, or policy regarding suspension and debarment authority. Contractor queries or requests for reconsideration related to U.S. or Coalition installation base access eligibility must be directed to the authority responsible for base access decisions.<BR><BR>(a) USFOR-A FRAGO 10-200. United States Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) has directed that all shipments into and out of the Combined Joint Operations Area - Afghanistan (CJOA-A) be coordinated through the Defense Transportation System (DTS) in order to expedite the customs clearance process and facilitate the use of in-transit visibility for all cargo in the CJOA-A

(c) Responsibilities of the vendor carrier representative, shipping expediter, and/or customs broker: 
1. Afghanistan Import Customs Clearance Request Procedures: The carrier, shipping expediter, and/or customs broker is responsible for being knowledgeable about the Afghan Customs Clearance Procedures. 

2. Status of Customs Clearance Requests: All inquiries regarding the status of a customs clearance request prior to its submission to Department of Defense (DoD) Customs and after its return to the carrier representative or shipping expediter should be directed to the carrier or shipping agent. 

3. Customs Required Documents: The carrier representative or shipping expediter is required to provide the DoD Contracting Officer Representative (COR) with all documentation that will satisfy the requirements of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA).

1. The U.S Ambassador Afghanistan diplomatic note guarantees that the U.S. Government (USG) shipments are exempt from Afghanistan Customs duties and taxes. USG shipments do not provide commercial carriers with the authority to unnecessarily delay shipments or holdover shipments in commercial storage lots and warehouses while en route to its final destination. The U.S. Embassy expects that shipments will be expedited as soon as customs clearance paperwork is received from the respective GIRoA officials.<BR><BR>2. Imports: Documentation must list the year, make, model, and color of the commodity, the commodity Identification Number (if applicable) and for vehicles, the Engine Block Number. The following documentation is required for all import shipments:  An original Customs Clearance Request (CCR) prepared by the COR in accordance with Afghanistan customs guidance referenced in paragraph 4 below. 

a. Bills of Lading (for shipments by sea), Airway Bills (for shipments by air) or Commodity Movement Request (CMRs) (for overland shipments). In the consignee block, type in “US Military”. This will help the Afghan Customs officials to recognize that the shipment belongs to the US Military and, therefore, the shipment is subject to tax exemption provisions as specified under the current Diplomatic Note or Military Technical Agreement (MTA). 
b. Shipping Invoices. 
c. Packing Lists. Required only if the shipping invoice does not list the cargo. 
d. An Afghan Government Tax Exemption Form (Muaffi Nama) purchased from the Department of Customs and Revenue and prepared in the local language by the carrier representative, shipping agent, or customs broker. 
e. A Diplomatic Note, prepared by DoD Customs, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the initiation of customs formalities with the Ministry of Finance, Department of Customs and Exemptions. Please note that DoD Customs is not responsible for registering vehicles. 
f. Commercially-owned equipment such as vehicles, construction machinery or generators that are leased and imported to Afghanistan for the performance of a USG contract may be subject to taxes and duties as determined by GIRoA. If commercially-owned equipment is imported into Afghanistan in a duty-free status, that duty-free status only applies as long as the equipment is under the exclusive use of the USG contract. If the equipment is released at the end of the contract, applicable GIRoA duties and taxes will apply to the owner if the equipment is not exported from Afghanistan or transferred to another USG contract. 
g. USG-owned vehicles must be exported at the conclusion of the project period or transferred to another USG entity. Under certain conditions, the USG may transfer equipment or vehicles to GIRoA. 

3. Exports: The following documentation is required for all export shipments: 
a. An original CCR prepared by the COR. If COR is not available, the Contracting Officer (KO) will prepare the CCR. 
b. Invoices. 
c. Packing Lists. Required only if the shipping invoice does not list the cargo. 
d. A Diplomatic Note, prepared by the DoD Customs Cell, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the initiation of customs formalities with the Ministry of Finance, Department of Customs and Exemptions. 
4. Customs requirements from the GIRoA may change with little notice. For current detailed instructions on customs guidelines in Afghanistan, refer to “The Instruction for Customs Clearance Request (Import/Export) Operations.” In all cases, the carrier is required to obtain a copy of this document, found at the following link: http://trade.gov/static/AFGCustomsSOP.pdf<BR><BR>(a) Pursuant to the authority of USCENTCOM FRAGO’s 09-1567 and 10-143 this contract is awarded in Afghani (local currency), if awarded to a host nation vendor.

  (b) Accordingly, any contract resulting from this solicitation is subject to the limitation on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR 125.6, or the limitations on subcontracting requirements in the FAR clause, as applicable.  The Contractor is advised that in performing contract administration functions, the Contracting Officer may use the services of a support contractor(s) retained by VA to assist in assessing the Contractor's compliance with the limitations on subcontracting or percentage of work performance requirements specified in the clause. To that end, the support contractor(s) may require access to Contractor's offices where the Contractor's business records or other proprietary data are retained and to review such business records regarding the Contractor's compliance with this requirement.  
  (c) All support contractors conducting this review on behalf of VA will be required to sign an  Information Protection and Non-Disclosure and Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest Agreement  to ensure the Contractor's business records or other proprietary data reviewed or obtained in the course of assisting the Contracting Officer in assessing the Contractor for compliance are protected to ensure information or data is not improperly disclosed or other impropriety occurs.  
  (d) Furthermore, if VA determines any services the support contractor(s) will perform in assessing compliance are advisory and assistance services as defined in FAR 2.101, Definitions, the support contractor(s) must also enter into an agreement with the Contractor to protect proprietary information as required by FAR 9.505-4, Obtaining access to proprietary information, paragraph (b).

D.4  52.212-2  EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)
  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Past Performance and Price.
PAST PERFORMANCE: This factor will be used to assess an offeror s history of successful performance on prior contracts of the same or similar services. Offerors without relevant past performance or for whom information is not available will not be evaluated favorably OR unfavorably on past performance. 
PRICE: This factor will be evaluated to determine if the offered prices are reasonable. The Government will evaluate quotes, for award purposes, by adding all option periods to the total price of the base period. The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p><br />SCHEDULE/REQUIREMENT<br />CLIN 0001<br />Description:&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide all Labor, Material and Equipment for Services to Create Captions and Transcripts for 94 Videos Containing 3,847 Minutes in Accordance with the Attached Statement of Work<br />Quanity:&nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />Unit:&nbsp;&nbsp;JB<br />Price:&nbsp;&nbsp; $_______________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Statement of Work<br />Video Captioning <br />Purpose: Create captions and transcripts to video content (mp4 files) Video Captions for 94 videos containing 3,847 minutes that will be posted on geodesy.noaa.gov to educate the public about geodesy, coastal mapping and other National Geodetic Survey (NGS) activities.</p>
<p>Justification: NGS must provide information about its products and services in order to meet its mission of providing access to the National Spatial Reference System. It is expensive for both end-users and NGS employees to travel to meetings and conferences, so the NGS public website geodesy.noaa.gov is often the most efficient way to distribute information. Additionally, video content (mp4 files) posted to the website has added value because the combination of text or images with narration can assist in explaining technical and complex material. However, the mp4 files posted to the website should be captioned or posted with a transcript in order to comply with Section 508 of the National Rehabilitation Act. <br />Section 508 states that, "When developing, procuring, maintaining, or using electronic and information technology, each Federal department or agency [...] shall ensure, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the department or agency, that the electronic and information technology allows, regardless of the type of medium of the technology, individuals with disabilities [...] to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access of [those] who are not individuals with disabilities."<br />NGS has hosted numerous webinars and now manages a monthly Webinar Series. The current library of recorded webinars (each about 1 hour in length) needs to be captioned and posted online in conjunction with a transcript to ensure all users can benefit from these educational materials. To ensure the successful completion of this task, NGS requires the assistance of professionals to create captions based on existing mp4 files and provide:</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor will have access to the mp4 videos through an FTP site (NOS) that will be provided upon award.<br />&bull; The contractor will deliver a "perfected" caption file in the .SRT format. Perfected means:<br />o 99% accuracy of the words spoken by the moderator and speaker;<br />o 99% accuracy with respect to the timing of mp4 versus timestamping in the caption file;<br />o Text edited for grammar and spelling.<br />&bull; The .SRT file must include: <br />o A number showing the subtitle's order in the series, starting with 1.<br />o The time that the subtitle starts, followed by --&gt; and the time it ends.<br />o The subtitle text.<br />o A blank line to show where the next subtitle begins.<br />&bull; The contractor will provide a separate "perfected" transcript file, removing all numbers, timestamps and unnecessary spacing from the caption file. The transcript will be an editable text document.<br />&bull; NGS will provide the unedited mp4 file with the video and audio recording. NGS will also provide the accompanying slide decks (e.g. powerpoint slides) that were used in the webinar to assist with "perfecting" the content because a lot of the words are technical in nature.<br />&bull; Minimum of 600 minutes per week each QA/QC within a week of delivery.</p>
<p><br />IT Security Requirements<br />The Assessment and Authorization (A&amp;A) requirements of Clause 48 CFR 1352.239-72 do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.<br />The contractor will not access, store, process or transmit any government privileged information. The contractor will not have access to any non-public government information, systems and/or networks.<br />1) The contractor must ensure all NOAA information and contractor solution resides within the United States.<br />2) All electronic provided information by the contractor must undergo malicious software scanning using a commercial anti-virus and anti-spyware software to ensure the information is free of known malicious software. The contractor must work with the COR prior to sending the information to establish a secure method for transfer (see NOS-ftp in previous section). <br />3) The contractor agrees, in the performance of this contract, to keep the information furnished by the Government and designated by the Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative in the strictest confidence. The contractor also agree not to publish or otherwise divulge such information in whole or part, in any manner or form, nor to authorize or permit others to do so, taking such reasonable measures as are necessary to restrict access to such information while in the contractor's possession, to those employees needing such information to perform the work provided herein, i.e., on a "need to know" basis. The contractor agrees to immediately notify the Contracting Officer in writing in the event that the contractor determines or has reason to suspect a breach of this requirement. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the contractor must securely remove all copies of the files developed for this acquisition.</p>

<p>NAM 1330-52.270-304, NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.<br /><br />(End of Clause)<br />SOLICITATION PROVISIONS</p>

<p>Technically acceptable is defined as the offeror's ability to meet all the requirements/salient characteristics identified in the Statement of Work/Specification and the offeror's demonstrated ability to perform the contract successfully through past performance. Only the lowest priced offer will be evaluated for technical acceptability. If the lowest priced offer is not found to be technically acceptable, then the next lowest price offer will be evaluated. This process will continue until a technically acceptable offer is identified; not all offers will be evaluated. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers (1) Technical, (2) Past Performance, (3) Price.</p>
<p>(1) Technical (Pass/Fail)<br />The Government will evaluate the offeror's ability to provide the Trimble TSC7 Ergonomic controller and Pole Mount IAW with attached statement of requirements. Offers that cannot specifically address their ability to provide the equipment IAW the statement of requirements or that do not submit a Technical Section with their offer may be rejected without further consideration.</p>
<p>(2) Past Performance (Pass/Fail)<br />The Government may use a variety of sources, data, and/or information available about the offeror's current or past performance, not just the information identified by an offeror to evaluate past performance.</p>
<p>(3) The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness and award a contract to the offeror with the lowest price technically acceptable offer.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />a. (1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />b. (2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />c. (3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />d. (4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />i. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />1. (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />2. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />ii. (ii) Examples.<br />1. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />2. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />3. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />4. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />9.

[The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />a.

(1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror &#9633; does &#9633; does not certify that-<br />i.

(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.<br />12.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue solicitation N00024-19-R-4401 for the execution of the USS Fort McHenry (LSD 43) Fiscal Year (FY) 19 Dry-Docking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) on a coast-wide basis (East Coast). The availability will include a combination of maintenance, modernization, and repair, and is expected to require a highly capable contractor with substantial facilities, to include a WHIDBEY ISLAND-Class dock landing ship capable pier and dry-dock as well as human resources capable of completing, coordinating, and integrating multiple areas of ship maintenance, repair, and modernization. The delivery date of the vessel is expected to be no later than 8 January 2021.
<p>In accordance with the CNO's Homeport Statute, 10 U.S. Code 7299a(c) requires a contract for short-term work for the overhaul, repair, or maintenance of a naval vessel be performed at the homeport of the vessel, provided there is adequate competition. 10 U.S. Code 7299a(c)(4) defines "short term work" as work that will be for a period of ten months or less. Since the production period for this FY19 DSRA is greater than 10 months, this availability will be competed on a coast-wide (East Coast) basis without limiting the place of performance to the vessel's homeport. Based on the complexity, magnitude, and duration of the requirement, the Government's market research indicates there are not two or more small business concerns capable of competing for the requirement and therefore this procurement will not be set-aside for small business (FAR 19.502-2(b)).</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued electronically via Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at http://fbo.gov and interested parties must comply with that announcement. Interested offerors should monitor the FBO page for the release of the solicitation, and any applicable amendments. Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to participate in this procurement at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. FBO is the single point of entry for posting of the synopsis and solicitations to the internet. This pre-solicitation notice is for information only and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award of contracts. The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept proposals as a result of this synopsis. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or around 15 January 2019.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates making a single award on or around 24 May 2019.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue, on a sole source basis, a Request for Proposal (RFP) to Huntington Ingalls Incorporated (HII), P.O. Box 7003, Pascagoula, MS 39568, for the accomplishment of Planning Yard (PY) support of CG-47 TICONDEROGA-class and DD-963 SPRUANCE-class ships. These efforts include, but are not limited to:
<p>- Planning Yard technical and engineering support as delineated in the Navy Modernization Program Management Oversight Manual NAVSEA SL720-AA-MAN-030 Revision 3;</p>
<p>- Alteration design and planning, systems platform integration, logistics and configuration management support;</p>
<p>- CNO availability planning and execution support, including availability duration analysis;</p>
<p>- PIO Material procurement; and</p>
<p>- On-site technical support, and modernization and repair support.</p>
<p>The contract will be awarded pursuant to statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The anticipated contract award date will be in Q4 FY19 and the period of performance will consist of a base year and four option years.</p>
<p>HII, as the lead design agent and shipbuilder for the CG-47 Class, has extensive experience in designing and building CG-47 Class ships beginning in 1978 with the CG design and construction contract. HII has performed the in service planning yard functions defined in the Navy Modernization Process Management and Operations Manual (NMP MOM) under its current contract and past contracts since 1988. HII is the only responsible source that can perform PY support efforts within the required program schedules without significantly higher, non-recoverable costs and without experiencing unacceptable delays. Transfer of the delivery of modernization support material and installation support products to another provider would result in significant non-recoverable costs and schedule delays.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact HII directly. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation notice is for information only and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award of contracts. The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept proposals as a result of this synopsis.</p>

The award will be made to cover Federal properties located throughout the state of Utah and in Grand Junction, CO. The IDIQ JOCC contract involves a base year and four, one-year options.
<div><br /></div>
<div>The scope provides for the flexibility to add Federal properties within the states of Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, or South Dakota through bilateral agreement to modify the contract to GSA properties within these areas, if required.&nbsp;
<div><br /></div>
<div>The scope of task orders may include red-line drawings and as-built drawings that show deviations or modifications completed as part of the construction. Task orders may not include requirements for stamped drawings from a licensed architect or engineer.</div>

<div><br /></div>

<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Estimated Scope of Task Orders: </strong>The following is provided for informational purposes only. Offerors should be aware that annual budgets are highly variable and the actual quantities and value of work changes annually. Data shows that GSA, PBS Region 8 executes about 5 - 60 contract actions annually to perform minor alterations and repairs that fall within the scope of construction services covered by the IDIQ JOCC. GSA also executes reimbursable work authorizations on behalf of other agencies for tenant improvement projects. Although construction activities take place throughout the year, a large quantity of these projects typically falls between the months of April and September. The expected average dollar value of projects executed under the scope is about $25,000 and the median value is about $12,500. The majority of task orders are expected to be between $2,000 and $25,000; however, occasionally some task orders may approach or exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $250,000.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Proposal Information: </strong>Interested offerors should carefully read the attached documents and solicitation document to for a complete description of proposal information and requirements. This procurement uses a tradeoff process to determine the offer that represents the best value to the Government. Non-Price Factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Total Evaluated Price.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The proposal will consist of two volumes:</div>
<div>1. Volume I:&nbsp; Price Proposal - includes Standard Form 1442 and Supplement to Standard Form 1442.</div>
<div>2. Volume II: Technical Proposal - includes one go-no-go factor, three non-price factors, and offeror representations and certifications.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The non-price factors requested for this RFP are as follows:</div>
<div>(1) Evidence of a bona fide place of business (this is a go-no-go factor evaluated as pass/fail);</div>
<div>(2) Offeror Past Performance;</div>
<div>(3) Management Plan; and</div>
<div>(4) Offeror Past Experience.</div>
<div><br /></div>

The coefficients will be provided for the base year, and four one-year option periods. Each year of the contract will also include a max forward priced bond rate. The coefficients are connected to the RSMeans Data Book.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The unit prices listed in the RS Means Building Construction Cost Data are bare costs. Bare cost equals a factor of 1.000, the same as "NET", all other bid factors "MINUS" or "PLUS" will be added or subtracted from the bare cost factor. A "MINUS" 4% would be written as 0.96, a "PLUS" 4% would be written as 1.040 and "NET" would be written as 1.000. The offered bid factors for the base and each option period will be applied to all work items for which a unit price is stated in the price schedule that are ordered via task orders in the respective base and option periods.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Additional Information on Evaluation: </strong>The Government reserves the right to make award without discussions. Therefore, offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information as the Government may evaluate and make a final decision for award solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted by offerors. Furthermore, the Government may determine the acceptability of a proposal based on the initial proposal submitted by offerors. Offerors are required to submit a price volume and a technical volume. The Government reserves the right to establish a competitive range in the interest of efficiency in the procurement process. The contracting officer may elect to limit the number of proposals to the greatest number that will permit efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</div>

<p>All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.SAM.gov) prior to award of a<br />contract. All proposed contractors are highly encouraged to review FAR Clause 52.232-33 Payments by Electronic<br />Funds Transfer - System for Award Management, which indicates "All payments by the Government under this<br />contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT)."

Contractors will need to obtain a unique entity identifier for processing their registration. Refer to<br />www.SAM.gov for information formerly found in CCR, EPLS, ORCA and FedReg.</p>
<p>Please begin the registration process immediately in order to avoid delay of the contract award should your firm be<br />selected.</p>
<p>ALERT: You must submit a notarized letter appointing the authorized Entity Administrator before your registration<br />will be activated.

Remember, there is no</p>
<p>cost to use SAM. To find out additional information about the changes of the SAM registration process, contractors<br />should visit the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) link located at the top of the SAM homepage (www.sam.gov).<br />PLEASE NOTE: SAM is completely free of charge for both registrants and users.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor, 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or
successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)
HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther
King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,
Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in
accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)
THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:
1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For
example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,
then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
Page 8 of 11
https://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scafiles/std/15-5439.txt?v=7 12/20/2018
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.
Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;
(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or
(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).
2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).
** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **
An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to
ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as
screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives,
and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.
All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization,
modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive
ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading
and cleaning of artillery ranges.
A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to
ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like;
minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All
operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.
** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:
Page 9 of 11
https://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scafiles/std/15-5439.txt?v=7 12/20/2018
The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.
** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **
The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),
dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.
** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE, Standard
Form 1444 (SF-1444) **
Conformance Process:
The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR
4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor
prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees
(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final
determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which
shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day
of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure
to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested
parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the
date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act
and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are
included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage
determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.
The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:
1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).
2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.
3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
Page 10 of 11
https://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scafiles/std/15-5439.txt?v=7 12/20/2018
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S.
Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).
4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.
5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the
contractor.
6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy
of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See
29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).
Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.
When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties
requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage
determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1)).

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Skytron or equal Table: Operating.  This requirement is a Brand Name or Equal commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
Solicitation number 36C10G19Q0012 is issued for this combined synopsis/solicitation; this solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2019-01 dated December 20, 2018.  
Requirement Description:
To ensure we can continue to provide Veterans with the benefits and care they have earned through their selfless service, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is changing the way we do business.  Specifically, we are improving the management of our supply chain to aggregate demand and facilitate ease of ordering in the field.  Throughout VA, we are moving from local contracting to national contracting whenever feasible.  Simplified ordering processes will drive volume towards suppliers with national contracts.  Simultaneously, greater cost transparency throughout the VA will allow clinicians and VA leaders to select medical equipment that optimizes Veteran outcomes at the lowest cost.
For our suppliers, we anticipate that these changes will ease the process of doing business with the VA and drive down our suppliers  costs.  We welcome opportunities to work closely with suppliers to further reduce costs.  In return, we expect that suppliers will offer the VA value commensurate with VA s status as the largest integrated healthcare provider in the United States.  Specifically, VA expects that it will receive the most favorable prices, warranties, conditions, benefits, and terms for the same product as those given by the supplier to any provider in the country.  We expect that VA s large volumes will increasingly be directed toward those suppliers best able to offer value to the VA.  VA looks forward to collaborating with its suppliers to further drive down costs to deliver optimal value to our Veterans.
VA has a requirement to purchase Skytron Brand Name or Equal Table: Operating to deliver patient care at its VA medical facilities throughout the United States, U.S. Territories, Guam, and the Philippines.  A Firm-Fixed-Price Requirements contract will be awarded in accordance with all terms, conditions, provisions, specifications and schedule of this solicitation herein. Quotes shall contain the vendor s best terms for cost/price and technical capabilities of the Skytron Brand Name or Equal Table: Operating Brand Name or Equal. The government reserves the right to award without discussions.  
The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339113 and the associated size standard is 750 employees.  This procurement action is unrestricted and not set-aside for small business concerns.  
This acquisition is in accordance with FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 16.5 for Skytron Brand Name or Equal Table: Operating as identified in Attachment A, Price Schedule.  All interested vendors shall provide a quote for all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) listed in Attachment A, Price Schedule which includes the option years.
VA is looking to establish a one-year contract with two 12-month option periods.  Delivery is FOB destination and requires delivery to VA medical facilities throughout the United States, U.S. Territories, Guam, and the Philippines.  Firm-Fixed-Price Orders will be placed against this contract in writing and will provide the exact delivery locations, delivery dates and exact quantities. 
The FAR provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition including attached addenda to the provision.
The FAR provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, and the specific evaluation criteria in the attached addenda also applies to this acquisition.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Vendor that provides a technically acceptable quote that conforms to the solicitation and which is determined to be the most beneficial (i.e., best value) to the government, considering technical capability and price.
Vendors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer, if not available in SAM.  Vendors are reminded to complete all fill-in Provisions listed on Attachment D, if not completed in SAM.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>As a member of the OTI Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) Team, the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition, stabilization, and conflict mitigation programs, to provide support and guidance for country program staff to help ensure the successful implementation of OTI program activities in the field.</p>
<p>OTI's success now and in the future depends in large part on its ability to achieve an overarching organizational goal: the effective transfer and ongoing analysis of knowledge and experience - comprised of values, management processes, lessons learned, best practices, standards, and innovations - in real time, with a variety of stakeholders. These stakeholders include: OTI staff in the field and headquarters; OTI's implementing partners around the world; USAID Missions overseas; other USAID offices and bureaus in Washington D.C.; other U.S. Government agencies and branches; other donors; other transition, stabilization and reconstruction practitioners; host government and/or other local counterparts; and the U.S. public. All of the above increases OTI's level of transparency and accountability.<br /> <br />To this end, the OTI ABC Team supports a model of organizational learning across the office that ensures:</p>
<p>1.	Increased transparency and accountability between the headquarters and field teams;<br />2.	Increased opportunities for peer-to-peer dialogue;<br />3.	Easier access to content and learning resources for a variety of stakeholders;<br />4.	More guidance available in online format;<br />5.	Provision of tools to surface and apply OTI's programming lessons to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of OTI programs.</p>
<p>The M&amp;E Specialist supports OTI's mission to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key political transition and stabilization needs by building the knowledge, skills and abilities of OTI staff to continually improve country program performance. The M&amp;E Specialist does this by: designing and providing innovative solutions that are adapted to OTI's fast-paced global needs; developing and facilitating learning and training events; and providing support services ranging from procurement to linkages with private sector partners. ABC supports learning and innovation through the application of technology - including OTI's knowledge management platform, mapping, data visualization, and other analytic tools - to continually improve OTI country program analysis, management and performance. ABC will ensure the effective integration of lessons and knowledge into OTI's learning and training resources. ABC coordinates closely with other units, teams, and divisions within OTI to achieve these goals.</p>

<p>AAPDs and CIBs contain changes to USAID policy and General Provisions in USAID regulations and contracts.  Please refer to http://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/aapds-cibs#psc to determine which AAPDs and CIBs apply to this contract.</p>
<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES - Please see Attachment 2 to this solicitation for information on AAPD No. 18-02.</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 2</p>
<p>Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter 7. <br />USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR)</p>
<p>APPENDIX D - DIRECT USAID CONTRACTS WITH A U.S. CITIZEN OR A U.S. RESIDENT ALIEN FOR PERSONAL SERVICES ABROAD</p>
<p>GP 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES (MAY 2018) (Pursuant to class deviation #M/OAA-DEV-AIDAR-18-3c)</p>
<p>USAID will provide Medevac services to the contractor and authorized dependents, through the Department of State's Bureau for Medical Services (MED), similar to those provided to U.S. Government employees in accordance with 16 FAM 300 Medical Travel. Medevac costs include travel and per diem, but do not include medical care costs. To be covered by the Medevac program, the contractor and authorized dependents must obtain and maintain international health insurance coverage that includes overseas hospitalization, and must provide proof of such insurance to the contracting officer prior to relocation abroad.</p>

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCTOBER 2014)

(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

(i)	Factor 1: Technical Capability
(ii)	Factor 2:  Past Performance
(iii)	Factor 3:  Price

Factor 1 - Technical Capability
The offers will be evaluated using the information submitted in the technical approach and demonstrated experience/evidence of ability to successfully perform the services by addressing the following elements:
1)	Expertise:  What is the Contractor's level of expertise in this field?  This includes key personnel (submit information on qualified key personnel, such as resumes and licenses).
2)	Scheduling:  What is the Contractor's proposal to accommodate duty-hours, shift-change, breaks, employee meal breaks, and response to incidents, or emergencies? 
3)	Subcontracting:  Does the Contractor plan to subcontract out any portion of the work?  If so, do they have a letter of commitment from the subcontractor indicating their commitment to this project upon award?

Factor 2 - Past Performance
The past performance questionnaires that the contractor submits with their proposal package will be reviewed to determine if the previous work was recent (within the past 5 years) and relevant (similar size and magnitude).  The questionnaires will also be reviewed to determine the overall trend in the ratings of quality for the previous contracts.
The offeror shall include a minimum of three, but no more than five questionnaires. In addition, the Government may solicit past performance on contracts not listed by the offeror. If an offeror does not have any past performance information to submit as the entity under which the offer is being submitted, then the offeror should submit past performance data identified above under which the offeror's key personnel have worked.  The offeror's proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which its past performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance.  The evaluation will consider both the relevance and quality of past contracts.  The Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).   The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources. The information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination.

Factor 3 - Price Schedule
The pricing information will consist of the contractor¿s overall price to provide these services.  To submit the pricing information, fill out the price schedule with the unit price and calculate the extended total.

Technical capability and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.  

(b)	 Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

The offeror shall submit pricing for the base period and all option periods, including option pricing for an additional 6-month period that may be authorized IAW FAR 52.217-8.  See FAR 52.217-8 which authorizes the Government to require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.  The pricing proposal should include a separate line item for the additional 6-month period IAW FAR 52.217-8.  

(c)	A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

FAR 52.212-3 - OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS 
The offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the Offeror has completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site located at http://www.sam.gov .

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

FedBizOps notes 26 July and the Solicitation notes 16 July.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:</span></strong> The proposal due date is 26 July18 at 3:30 pm and all questions regarding the proposal are due 9 July 18 at 11:59 pm. A revised Solicitation including the revised due date for proposals is hereby attached to this amendment. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:</span></strong> Section L - Are additional instructions missing from paragraph "2. Format and Specific Content: The following information shall be provided in the written technical proposal and will be evaluated to assess technical acceptability in accordance with Section M-900, Evaluation Basis for Award. The written technical proposal shall address each of the following sub-factors to describe the offeror's proposed approach to performing the requirements as set forth in the Performance-based Work Statement (PWS)." It seems like there should have been more here.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:</span></strong>&nbsp;Section L, subsection C(2) &nbsp;has been revised as follows:</p>
<p>FROM: 2. Format and Specific Content: The following information shall be provided in the written technical proposal and will be evaluated to assess technical acceptability in accordance with Section M-900, Evaluation Basis for Award. The written technical proposal shall address each of the following sub-factors to describe the offeror's proposed approach to performing the requirements as set forth in the Performance-based Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>TO: 2. Format and Specific Content: Three (3) Subfactors will be evaluated to assess the technical acceptability in accordance with Section M-900, Evaluation Basis for Award. The written technical proposal shall address each of the Sub-factors listed in Section M, sub-section III to describe the offeror's proposed approach to performing the requirements as set forth in the Performance-based Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:</span></strong> Section L - There are no instructions for the cost volume. It would appear logically that they would follow the instructions for Volumes 1 and 2. Are additional instructions missing?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:</span></strong> Please refer to Section L, sub-section II, A(8) where it states that Volume III shall be presented in excel format with the ability to view any formulas or calculations (see Attach_10_Pricing_Spreadsheet and Attach_8_VPP_DART_TCIR_Chart). Volume III, TEP Attachment should not be adjusted, except for adding unit prices. There are no additional instructions for this volume.</p>

The United States Air Force (USAF) Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Global Positioning Systems Directorate (SMC/GP), Contracting Office (PKL), Peterson Air Force Base, CO intends to release a solicitation and to negotiate the continued GPS Ground segment sustainment support as risk mitigation is required since the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) initial operational capability has been delayed beyond the need date for the first launch of GPS III Space Vehicle 01 (SV01). GPS III satellites are currently being built for SMC by Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC).<br /><br />There are approximately two dozen system modifications underway or in the planning stage to modernize the existing GPS Control Segment, the Architecture Evolution Program (AEP).  These modifications address known critical requirement shortfalls in operational capability and cybersecurity areas needed to support the launch and control of the next generation of GPS III satellites scheduled for May 2018.  One of the modifications currently on-going is the Contingency Flight Operations (COps) which requires a modification of AEP's operational Kalman filter.  This modification requires integration with LMSSC-developed GPS III test tools for upload generation, an upload capability through LMSSC's Launch and Checkout Capability (LCC) or through AEP, and the tracking of legacy GPS III signals using the existing GPS monitoring stations.&nbsp;
<p><br />SMC/GP believes that, due to its unique position as the sustainer of AEP, developer and operator of the GPS III Launch and Checkout Capability and developer of GPS III satellites, only LMSSC is capable of performing this work, in accordance with only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. SMC/GP intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to LMSSC for a seven year Sustainment Support Services contract to begin January 2019.  The envisioned contract action will be structured to continue and conclude those efforts without impacting current critical GPS space and control activities in support of ongoing U.S. and coalition warfighter operations.<br /> <br />A. Background: <br /> <br />The GCS II sustainment contract is the vehicle the GPS program sustainment organization (SMC/GPL) will use to satisfy the program director's vision and mission.  SMC/GPL is chartered to ensure the Operational Control Segment (OCS) viability until the next generation control segment (OCX) effort completes development and is fielded.  This contract provides organization and depot maintenance services to the operational unit.  It encompasses, but is not limited to, hardware maintenance, software releases, technical documentation, system administration, cybersecurity, special studies, data collection and anomaly response.<br /> <br />GCS II will provide sustainment functions for the GPS Control Segment which includes the Master Control Station (MCS), Alternate Master Control Station (AMCS), GPS Support Facility (GSF), four Ground Antennas (GA), six Monitor Stations (MS), Positional Training Emulator (PTE), GPS Information Network (GIN), Telecommunications Simulator Test Station (TSTS), Consolidated Test Environment (CTE) located at the following locations:  Schriever AFB (MCS, GSF, PTE, MS, GIN), Vandenberg AFB (AMCS, LADO Backup, GIN), Kwajalein (GA, MS), Ascension (GA, MS), Diego Garcia (GA, MS), Cape Canaveral (GA, MS), Hawaii (MS), and Colorado Springs CO (CTE). <br /> <br />B. Requirements<br /> <br />This effort includes providing operations and maintenance support on the test-bed/training suite located at the contractor's facility and operational systems located around the world.  The Contractor provides program management, risk management, safety and quality management; systems engineering; hardware and software maintenance; baseline configuration and data management; Technical Order management; planning, design, test, and evaluation for all system baseline upgrades due to new satellite platforms and preplanned system upgrades; programmed depot maintenance; emergency depot level maintenance; operator and maintainer training; system anomaly tracking, investigation and resolution; system trending analysis; equipment and software license obsolescence management; cybersecurity and processing of information assurance activities for network certification and accreditation.<br /> <br />Qualified sources must demonstrate the ability to deliver this capability with minimal investment by the Government. Qualified sources must additionally demonstrate all of the following capabilities:<br /> <br />(1) A thorough understanding of the GPS PNT mission, including Kalman filters, message generation and upload, message and signal types, and signal monitoring.<br /> <br />(2) A thorough understanding of the GPS II and III payloads, including their interfaces as well as their upload and download message formats.<br /> <br />(3) A thorough understanding of and demonstrated performance in delivering satellite control systems with the highest levels of Cybersecurity protections.<br /> <br />(4) Extensive systems engineering experience, knowledge, and background dealing with PNT systems, including system requirements analysis, test and verification, risk management, and system Cybersecurity management.<br /> <br />(5) Software and hardware maintenance, including installation and testing of all upgrades on a 24/7 schedule, as required, for the GPS Support Facility (GSF).  The GSF provides an environment for crew recurring and positional certification training, integration of new software releases and software maintenance updates into the operational baseline, completion of level 1 software maintenance activities, and associated configuration management/control of these tasks.  Also provides maintenance for the Monitor Station Receiver Element (MSRE). <br /> <br />(6) Depot level software maintenance and support to include fixes to operational problem reports (PRs), software deliveries, and incorporation of General Officer level priorities for the GPS Control Segment and the GIN.  Also provides a test environment (Consolidated Test Environment (CTE), Telecommunication Simulation Test Station (TSTS), and GSF) up to a 24/7 schedule, as required, to test new software releases and upgrades.<br /> <br />(7) Organizational level hardware and software maintenance support at the MCS, AMCS, and GIN only; sustainment program management/support, Cybersecurity; maintenance of an electronic document library; and infrastructure support functions for the GPS Control Segment and GIN.<br /> <br />(8) The labor and materials required to develop, procure, fabricate, integrate, test and install all hardware and software, as necessary, to complete 3600/3021 modifications to the fielded GPS Control Segment and GIN. <br /> <br />(9) Technical Order Management Agency (TOMA) support functions to include configuration management for and incorporate changes, publish and distribute GPS, United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) and GIN Technical Orders (TO).  Also provide configuration management for and incorporate changes, publish and distribute GPS and GIN engineering drawings as source data for the TOs.  Changes to the drawings and TOs will be driven by user requests, administrative corrections, hardware modifications, and depot level driven changes.<br /> <br />(10) Sustaining engineering support to include reliability/maintainability/availability (RMA) data analysis, obsolescence analysis, equipment/system specific technical assessments, and recurring information assurance (IA) support for the GPS Control Segment, GIN, and test assets/support facilities under contractor control and responsibility.  RMA data analysis results in optimizing operational system performance and identifying high failure equipment items that lower operational availability and need to be considered for replacement.  Obsolescence analysis identifies unsupportable equipment/sub-systems also for proactive replacement planning and implementation.  Equipment/system specific technical assessments establish an engineering design solution for equipment identified for replacement (from RMA and obsolescence analysis) before implementation using the sustainment modification process.  Cybersecurity support is required to maintain Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) of our fielded systems, test assets, and contractor controlled support facilities in accordance with Department of Defense directives, while continuously identifying and mitigating current/future threats and vulnerabilities.<br /> <br />(11) Depot hardware maintenance support for the GPS OCS and GIN.  This support includes performing Emergency Depot Level Maintenance (EDLM), Urgent Depot Level Maintenance (UDLM), Technical Assistance (TA) for the GPS OCS, GPS communications network, and GIN.  It also includes annual Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) at the all the GA and MS locations.<br /> <br />(12) The necessary program management, supplier/subcontract management, and contracts and pricing for the procurement of hardware spares for the fielded GPS Control Segment and GIN. <br /> <br />C.

<DESC><p>After reviewing all questions and responses from Industry Day, DLA Energy has three additional questions:</p>
<p>1. Initial responses to the RFI indicated that it would be difficult for offerors to price the electric costs associated with the remediation product on a firm-fixed price basis. The Government requests that interested parties provide additional clarification as to why, specifically, it is difficult to anticipate electric costs with a reasonable degree of confidence for this requirement.</p>
<p>2. With only one electric meter servicing the entire DFSP San Pedro facility, it may be necessary to install additional metering so that usage at the proposed thermal systems (for all seven total) could be billed separately. How much time would the Contractor need to coordinate approvals and install LADWP-approved meters? Would additional funding be required to install this utility company approved metering, rather than simply installing calibrated meters at each system (e.g. for reporting, management purposes)?</p>
<p>3. With only one natural gas meter along the western boundary of the tank farm area that services ongoing remediation systems, it may be necessary to install additional metering so that usage at the proposed thermal systems (for all seven total) could be billed separately. How much time would the Contractor need to coordinate approvals and install SoCal Gas-approved meters? Would additional funding be required to install this utility company approved metering, rather than simply installing calibrated meters at each system (e.g. for reporting, management purposes)?</p>

<DESC>Title:<br />FUNWAVE
<p>Description(s):</p>
<p>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Contracting Office has a requirement for validation of FUNWAVE-TVD vessel model for use in simulations of ship-induced waves and assessment of their potential impacts to Sabine-to-Galveston (S2G) hurricane and flood protection systems (HFPS) along Sabine-Neches Waterways (SNWW). The ERDC intends to solicit and award on a brand name basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(1)b, to University of Delaware., 220 HULLIHEN HALL NEWARK, DE 19716 (Cage Code: 015X1). It has been determined that only one source is reasonably available. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541715 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology) - nanotechnology research and experimental development laboratories; Size Standard is 1000 Employees. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with regulations at FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>Nature and/or description of the action being approved:</p>
<p>Last year, the USACE began initial work on implementation of pressure source and a boundary integral (panel) method for modeling ship wakes in a phase-resolving numerical wave model FUNWAVE. A robust, computationally efficient numerical model is still needed to address the ship wake quantification problem on a long-term operational scale. The quantification of erosion of shorelines and riverbanks due to ship-generated waves is a ubiquitous concern in most navigation channels across the country, particularly problematic in shallow coastal waters and regions not exposed to large sea swells or impacts from large wind generated waves. As a steadily increasing number of crafts are put into service, predominantly passenger ferry traffic, more coastal regions are exposed to wash from vessel wakes, causing a growing concern with respect to public safety, potential damage of coastal structures, and the corresponding environmental impacts. The ERDC Coastal &amp; Hydraulics Lab (CHL) last year had the requirement for a follow on assessment to upgrade the current capabilities in FUNWAVE's ship-wake modeling module of FUNWAVE. These were to be implemented with modern programming paradigms to make use of distributed High Performance Computing in which the action was competed and awarded to the University of Delaware. The new requirement will be a follow on assessment to facilitate the ERDC's improvements in ship wake generation mechanism for the phase-resolving numerical wave-modeling framework and extend the quantification of their erosion effects on adjacent shorelines, especially as it pertains to large container-type vessels in the Sabine-to-Galveston (S2G) project with analysis of potential impacts on hurricane and flood protection systems (HFPS) in Sabine-Neches Waterways (SNWW). These activities and capabilities will add to CHL's expertise in the use of complex physics-based numerical models for the propagation and evolution on nearshore shallow-water waves, which were generated by large vessels in confined spaces. The improvements in ship wake modeling will deliver more robust quantification of coastal erosion/scour by long and energetic breaking waves. These capabilities should be implemented in the currently utilized open source phase-resolving wave model FUNWAVE, to allow for multiple vessels interacting in near and far field regimes, have multi-grid coupling, as well as moving grids following the vessels. These capabilities should be verified against existing field data for a cohort of vessel and hull types; in particular large vessels that can generate surge-type waves.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall implement large-vessel wake generation capabilities within the framework of the existing ship-wake module in FUNWAVE. These capabilities should work seamlessly in the latest releases (3.0+) of FUNWAVE-TVD for simple and complex vessel geometries; in particular for multiple vessels following prescribed navigation paths. In addition, validation work from the recent implementation of non-cohesive sediment transport libraries and morphology modules will be needed against field data.</p>
<p>The quantification of potential impacts of ship wakes effects on adjacent shorelines should be investigated with newly implemented sediment transport and morphology module. The current USACE sediment transport libraries, like SEDLIB are also heavily utilized across CHL-ERDC and are of direct interest. Two-way coupling framework, moving grids, and a two-layer module to address waves over permeable shorelines are vital for the project.</p>
<p>Finally, the Contractor shall provide written guidance (e.g., Technical Notes, Technical Report, Journal Publications) on usability and applicability guidance of the ship wake generation mechanism in FUNWAVE-TVD, as well as scour/erosion hot spots validation work. Bi-weekly project update calls and emails are requested, along with monthly progress reports in PDF electronic format. The technology transfer in the form of a hands-on workshop delivered at the USACE Galveston District should be the final focal point of the contract.</p>
<p>Contracting without providing for full and open competition under this acquisition may of be accomplished pursuant to the authority 13.501(a)(1) (ii) of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.</p>
<p>Demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:<br />FUNWAVE is a phase-resolving, time-stepping Boussinesq model for ocean surface wave propagation in the nearshore and is copyrighted under the terms of the GNU General Public License. The Funwave, theory and numerical implementation of the initial code, ERDC has current operational capabilities to since this is an open-source, copy left software. The new module will need to be by added to Funwave a ship-wake modeling module currently in use by the Lab, by implementing and adding the with modern programming paradigms to make use of distributed High Performance Computing (HPC) with Message Passing Interface (MPI) library the ship wake generation of ship-generated waves. The modules will need to be validated against existing and established physical model data and field measurements, as well as higher fidelity numerical models that will be heavily used, not only in the CHL Lab, but ERDC wide.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals. A solicitation will not be issued. Requests for copies of a solicitation in response to this notice will not be honored or acknowledged. All interested responsible sources who feel they are capable of fulfilling this requirement may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The information submitted must be in writing and must be provided in sufficient detail to clearly demonstrate the vendor's ability to fulfill this requirement. The contractor must also provide a description of their past experience in fulfilling requirements which are the same or similar to this requirement and references for each. Any information submitted shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.</p>
<p>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the government not to compete this requirement on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Responses to this requirement shall be submitted to Robyn D. Wells at Robyn.D.Wells@usace.army.mil.

LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION 

1.  Contracting Activity:   Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Office of Procurement, Acquisition and Logistics 
Technology Acquisition Center
23 Christopher Way
Eatontown, NJ 07724

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a firm-fixed-price delivery   order (DO) issued under General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), Contract Number 47QTCA18D0081 with Executive Information Systems (EIS), Limited Liability Company (LLC) for brand name Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software and maintenance.  

3.  Description of Supplies/Services: VA, Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), Operations Veterans Affairs Central Office-Internet Technology Support Services, in support of Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA) has a requirement for SAS Analytics Pro software licenses, SAS add-ons and software maintenance.  SAS is an integrated software suite for advanced analytics, business intelligence, data management, and predictive analytics.  SAS will allow BVA to interface with current VA appeals data repositories, (i.e., Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) Corporate Database, BVA legacy Veterans Appeals Control and Locator System (VACOLS) database, BVA Appeals Modernization Caseflow data, Veterans Benefit Management System (VBMS) data,  HR Smart data), and analyze data using statistical techniques ranging from descriptive measures like correlations, logistic regression and mixed models to sophisticated methods such as modern model selection and Bayesian hierarchical models, providing BVA research analysts with required level of analysis. SAS will enhance the ability of the financial management division and the board as whole to develop analytic insights.  Applications at the BVA will include prescreening of case descriptors for triaging of cases for complexity analysis and assignment; performing principle component analysis, factor analysis, and cluster methodologies on existing case data to find trends and patterns that will be used to amplify performance; and time series and use pattern analysis across the attorney population for individual performance management. The results from these studies will prove significantly useful in preparing for the Appeals Modernization Act.  In addition, SAS provides dynamic visualization, model deployment and process optimization.  Lastly, SAS provides a range of techniques and processes for the collection, classification, analysis and interpretation of data to reveal patterns, anomalies, key variables and relationships, leading to new insights and better answers faster. The period of performance shall be 12 months from date of acceptance. The total estimated price of this proposed action is XXXXX

4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(a) (1)(i)(B),  Only one source is capable of providing supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies and services ordered are unique or highly specialized .

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  The proposed source for this action is Executive Information Systems (EIS), LLC, 6901 Rockledge Drive, Suite 600, Bethesda, MD 20817-7836.  Based on extensive market research, as described in section 8 of this document, it was determined that there is no competition among vendors for the required software and that EIS is the sole Government provider of SAS software and maintenance support. SAS offers the only known integrated suite of analytics software available that provides interoperability and compatibility with analytics software currently used throughout VBA, Appeals Management Office (AMO) and VHA   all of which currently use SAS.  Use of SAS software will provide compatibility with these organizations which is especially critical with the analysts for the BVA due to the Appeals Modernization Act which will be fully implemented in Feb 2019.  This law proscribes a new structure to benefits appeals processing and decisions that will increase the input rate of appeals case inventory.  Without advanced analytics to facilitate decisions on how to accommodate the new structure, the risk of an unsustainable input rate increases.  VBA and BVA analysts need to work in synchronization since the overwhelming number of appeals sent to BVA come through VBA.  These workloads are intertwined, and a common platform for advanced analytics is needed.  SAS is especially critical to the analysts for the BVA as SAS provides an integrated suite of analytics software that provides for predictive and descriptive modeling, data mining, text analytics, forecasting, optimization, simulation, and experimental design.   Use of commercial software will provide benefits that are not possible with using a general license command line analytics compiler such as R or Python. SAS software is the only complete functional statistical program that BVA can use because of compatibility with existing data throughout VA and affiliated institutions.  Information gathered from the SAS products is used to formulate policy and procedures in VA.  

SAS s software is proprietary in nature and is not released to any other party; only SAS or its authorized resellers have the required access to the source code and other proprietary software data to be able to meet the Government s needs.  No other firm has the capability to develop and issue software updates and fixes for SAS software necessary to support statistical and analytical requirements without access to SAS proprietary software code.  SAS software maintenance will ensure that all support services are performed and properly configured to the VA-owned SAS software which can only be provided by those who have access to the proprietary software code.  SAS software and support is sold to the Government exclusively through EIS and no other resellers.  Furthermore, EIS holds a current contract under GSA FSS 70.  Only EIS can provide the software and support that meets the Government s requirements.  Therefore, only an award to EIS will satisfy the Government s requirement for SAS software.  

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in section 8 of this justification.  There is no competition anticipated for this acquisition.  Based on market research, EIS is the only authorized Government reseller of SAS software maintenance.  In accordance with FAR 8.405-6 (a)(3)(i), the ordering activity will post the justification along with the Request for Quotation on the GSA e-Buy site.

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the marketplace that would warrant competition for other software solutions or additional resellers in the future.  Specifically, the Government will continue to research alternatives to SAS software and services that may provide the required capabilities, and/or research whether SAS will permit future third party access to its proprietary software to provide the required maintenance support.

8.  Market Research:  Government technical experts conducted market research in October 2018 by reviewing the similar software and software maintenance services mentioned below to ascertain if these items or providers could meet the Government s requirements. The Government technical experts reviewed various websites and trade publications and had discussions with data managers and researchers in VA to determine if there are other similar items that can meet the Government's requirements.  Specifically, VA technical experts researched International Business Machine's family of "Statistical Package for the Social Sciences" products; however, even though these products are comparable, none offered interoperability and compatibility with the current VBA and OI&T environment.  Additionally, the products only offer a limited array of analytics, and none offer a grid-enabled, high-performance computing environment which is crucial in meeting the Government's requirements.  VA technical experts also researched software from Oracle and Informatics; however, this software is also not interoperable and compatible with the current VBA environment.  Additionally, this software did not offer the array of advanced analytics sufficient to BVA's needs and mission.  SAS provider guarantees its algorithms and computations, whereas general license compiler has no guarantees and is only as good as the last upload from an unknown source.  SAS provider ensures technical support and help/tutorials with both basic and advanced features.  BVA s operations research analysts are familiar with the software, minimizing time to productive utilization.  Based on this market research, it was determined that only SAS software can meet all of the Government's requirements, and purchasing SAS Analytics Professional is in the Government's best interest.

VA performed further market research in October 2018 by conducting a search on the GSA e-Library.  Market research indicated only EIS has exclusive rights to sell and support all SAS software licenses and maintenance to Government customers.  Finally, Government representatives received a sole source letter on August 16, 2018 directly from SAS confirming EIS as the sole authorized reseller for SAS software to Government entities.  Therefore, this proposed action will be a sole source task order issued under GSA FSS 70, contract number 47QTCA18D0081 with EIS.
