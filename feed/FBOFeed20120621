<DESC>Action Code: BAT4140<br />Date: 6/21/12<br />Subject. DTRA-National Academies Research Partnership Initiative
<p>DTRA intends to award a sole-source purchase order (simplified acquisition) to the National Academy of Sciences, 500 Fifth St NW, Washington, DC 20001-2736, with a 1-year period of performance. DTRA is purchasing services and building partnerships to support its basic research program and to enhance the technology transition to defense and potential non-defense commercial applications. The proposed demonstration partnership is based on an initial 12-month pilot effort with the National Academies and their affiliate organization, the University Industry Demonstration Partnership, to sustain and mature the partnership, and to assess future potential.</p>
<p>A written request for quotation will be submitted as the solicitation. The intended source of award is the National Academy of Sciences. Known collectively as the National Academies, the organization produces groundbreaking reports that have helped shape sound policies, inform public opinion, and advance the pursuit of science, engineering, and medicine. This contract action will allow DTRA to partner with and piggyback on this unparalleled resource. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) issued a report in November 2008 entitled "University-Private Sector Research Partnerships in the Innovation Ecosystem." which cited the UIDP as a model framework for university-industry collaboration to enhance the commercialization of university research. DTRA's basic research program is by design, university centric. It would cost the DTRA millions of dollars to attempt to replicate the current UIDP organization with a membership over 200 leading research universities and industries. The private, nonprofit National Academies and its affiliate UIDP are uniquely suited and positioned to provide the support identified in this requirement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.<br />The solicitation will be released to the Nationl Academy of Sciences 15 days after the posting of this notice (7/6/12). A copy of the solicitation may be obtained by sending an email to mary.chase@dtra.mil. The anticipated award date is 7/21/12<br />** All qualified sources must respond in writing no later than 11:59 PM (EDT), 6 July 2012, to DTRA/BE-BCRB, Attn: Mary Kay Chase, mary.chase@dtra.mil. Responses received after this date/time are considered untimely and shall not be considered. Any documentation received shall become the property of the Government.</p>

<DESC>NASA GRC intends to increase the ceiling price for the Space Flight Systems Technical Support Services contract with Alphaport, Inc. in the amount of $1.2M per FAR 6.302-1. "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services satisfy agency requirements" under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)." Under the current contract, there has been greater utilization than originally anticipated and the burn rate has become higher than initial estimates.  Also, over the life of this contract project requirements have grown and new projects have emerged which have contributed to greater than anticipated utilization.  The increase in the contract ceiling will cover required on-going work efforts activities without interruption while a follow-on procurement is being conducted.  If current efforts are discontinued there would be a high probability of mission failure for the projects supported, and the Governments substantial investment (time and money) in these projects would be lost.  It is essential that the ongoing work continue to be performed by the current contractor as they have experience and understanding of the efforts being performed and offer GRC the greatest probability of successfully meeting GRCS project milestones and commitments. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 6, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. [OMBUDSMAN STATEMENT IS REQUIRED] NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html		.

<DESC>ANNUAL ACTUARIAL REVIEW OF THE MMI AND HECM FORWARD FUNDS
<p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of the Chief Procurement Office (OCPO), Washington, DC Contracting Operations Branch, announces its intent to issue a solicitation for a Small Business Administration (SBA), 8(a) competitive set aside. This requirement shall be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) to procure for the Annual Actuarial Review of FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund Forward and HECM Loans, in support of the Office of Housing's Office of Evaluation and the Office of Risk. The proposed contract type is a Fixed Price, Fixed Unit Rate (FUR). HUD intends to award an 8(a) Contract under the SBA 8(a) Program, to a qualified 8(a) contractor pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 19.8 - Contracting with the Small Business Administration (The 8(a) Program) as a result of this presolicitation.</p>
<p>The National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) of 1990 established criteria for the actuarial soundness of the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF). Specifically, NAHA mandated that the Secretary of HUD increase the capital ratio of the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF) (as defined in the Act) to 2.0 percent. The NAHA also required that the Secretary obtain an independent annual actuarial study of the MMIF, and to report to Congress annually on the financial status of the Fund.</p>
<p>Since the enactment of the NAHA capital standard, HUD has contracted with private firms to prepare the independent annual actuarial study of FHA single-family forward-loan insurance programs, including a written final report now known as the Actuarial Review. The focus of the written Review is on the economic net worth of the active insured forward-loan portfolio as of the end of each fiscal year, as defined by the NAHA legislation.</p>
<p>A contractor needed to build the next generation actuarial study models, to produce the Actuarial Review that results from the annual independent actuarial study of the MMIF, and to provide associated analyses that use the actuarial models to answer a variety of policy questions. The services of a contractor are required for a base period of three months and for five additional option years to be exercised at one year at a time at HUD's discretion. Specifically, the scope of work under the contract consists of (1) preparation for the transition, working closely with the previous contractor and HUD staff during the handoff process to gain detailed knowledge on the MMI Fund programs, the accounting and modeling frameworks, and FHA single family mortgage data, that are critical in conducting the actuarial study of the MMI Fund; (2) development and enhancement of a multi-part model for producing the annual actuarial study of forward and HECM loans in the MMI Fund with a particular focus on the implementation of an efficient stochastic simulation framework with house price and interest rate forecasts; (3) provision of expert services and incidental materials to produce the annual actuarial study of forward and HECM loans in the MMIF, including the timely delivery of outputs needed by HUD for the preparation of its annual audited financial statements; (4) a written Annual Actuarial Review that summarizes the actuarial study and its findings; (5) technical support services to HUD in implementing a run-time version of the model developed by the contractor and other version developed in-house, internally and /or externally in a remote server and/or in-house, and using the actuarial model and outputs in the preparation of the President's Budget and the conduct of policy analysis; (6) expert services to design and implement a multi-year research and development plan to enhance, redesign, and/or re-specify the components of the actuarial model for the purpose of improving both the long-run estimates of FHA's economic net worth and short-run predictions of FHA net claim costs and cash flows; and (7) provision of all the material, including model documentation, technical requirements, computer codes, data, and other results, necessary to review and understand the model and outputs, and implement the model internally.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance will be for a 15 month base period and 3 additional 12-month option periods, if exercised. It is anticipated that the scope of work in the base period as well as all option periods will include a significant level of effort devoted to research and development as described in item (6) above.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 523930. The size standard is $7M. The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or around July 16, 2012. The presolicitation, RFP and any amendments, updates, questions, answers and changes to the posted information will be available at the following websites: www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>
<p>In case of conflict between information contained in the formal solicitation and that contained in this pre-solicitation synopsis notice, the information in the formal solicitation will govern. It is therefore the vendor's responsibility to check the website daily for any updated changes.</p>
<p>Please note: Due to inherent organizational conflict of interests, all classes of mortgagees, lenders or loan servicers are excluded from the competition. This applies to both prime and sub-prime contractors.<br /><br />QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED UNTIL THE SOLICITATION IS POSTED.</p>

<CONTACT>Peter Reid, Internal Operations, Smithsonian Enterprises, Phone 202-633-2498, Email preid@si.edu
<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The Smithsonian Institution intends to issue a Request for Proposals ("RFP") from library resource providers to create Smithsonian-branded digital library resources that leverage Smithsonian content in a searchable format, for distribution to library, academic and research markets. In addition, in order to supplement the digital content, the resource provider will also create and distribute in-classroom print learning materials, as appropriate. Smithsonian content sources will include Smithsonian magazine and Air&amp;Space magazine, and may potentially include content from other Smithsonian sources. Key to the program will be unique product features and benefits that leverage Smithsonian's brand and assets. <br /><br />The RFP is anticipated to be available in late June. Please note: <br /><br />1. Interested companies must meet the following minimum qualification requirements in order to be considered :</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. Demonstrated understanding of and experience working within the parameters of court decisions in Tasini v. New York Times, 533 U.S. 483 (2001), Faulkner v. National Geographic Society, 409 F.3d 26 (2d Cir. 2005) and Greenberg v. National Geographic Society, 488 F.3d 1331 (11th Cir. 2007) regarding the privilege accorded to magazine publishers under Section 201(c) of the Copyright Act of 1976 to produce digital compilations of previously published print magazines provided that such reproductions retain contextual fidelity to the original print magazine by reproducing the entire collective work in the precise manner (including articles, images, advertisements, etc.) in which it was originally printed. To fulfill this requirement, library and research resource providers should present a listing of all of the current or past product offerings that they have developed that are consistent with these court decisions as well as how long they have distributed that material.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. Demonstrated expertise in the handling and preservation of rare materials. To fulfill this requirement, library and research resource providers should indicate how many years they have been developing products from rare materials and list the sources of those rare materials i.e. companies, libraries, or museums. Minimum requirement is 1 year of rare material handling and preservation experience from at least one source.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c. Current, large-scale distribution of both online content for library, classroom and research purposes, as well as in-classroom print learning material. To fulfill this requirement, library and research resource providers should be able to indicate, at minimum, existing distribution of the online content for library, classroom and research purposes and in-classroom print learning material on a nation-wide scale. <br /><br />2. The Smithsonian anticipates the need to disclose certain confidential information about its business activities during the RFP process. As a result, we will require that requestors sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement prior to receiving a copy of the RFP. <br /><br />If your company is interested in working with the Smithsonian to develop and distribute the products described above, please contact Peter Reid, Smithsonian Enterprises, at 202-633-2498 or preid@si.edu to request a copy of the NDA. Proposals are due on August 2, 2012. Requested materials must be submitted by the deadline in order to be considered.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Memphis District has a requirement for constructing the Lower Cache River. The work consists of furnishing all plant, labor and materials for constructing the Lower Cache River AR 1135 Project, Plug Removal 1, 2 and 3; Weirs, 1, 2, and 3; and Cross Ditch Closure.  For the plug removals, material will be excavated and moved to spoil pile areas that will open up the historical meander of the river.  The weirs will be downstream of the plug removals and construction will consist of earthwork excavation and placement of filter material, R90 and R2200 riprap.  The material excavated for each of the three weirs shall be placed back into the existing channel.  Cross ditch closure construction will consist of excavation to elevations where a cross ditch closure between the river and the old meander will be constructed and protected with selective placement of filter material and R90 riprap.  The material excavated for the cross ditch closure shall be placed on spoil pile areas.  The water elevations in the Lower Cache River are for the most part controlled by the back water of the White River.  These water elevations may vary greatly during the construction season.  The approximate width of the Lower Cache River is 200 plus ft.  The work shall be located along the Lower Cache River approximately between 3 and 7 miles upstream of the mouth of the Lower Cache River where it discharges into the White River at the City of Clarendon, Arkansas.  <br><br>The estimated value of the proposed work is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  Plans and specifications will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web page at www.fbo.gov .  All prospective offerors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registry www.ccr.gov  and provide Offeror Representations and Certifications for their company. The preferred method for completing offeror representations and certifications is to register on the ORCA web site at https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx . The issue date will be on or about July 9, 2012 with a projected bid opening date of August 9, 2012.  Offers may register on the interested Vendor's List (IVL) and retrieve an IVL from the same location.  Bidders are encouraged to check often for changes (amendments) to posted solicitation.  This procurement is unrestricted with a Hubzone price evaluation preference.  It is issued under NAICS code 237990 for a firm-fixed price contract.

<a href="mailto:isaac.j.taylor@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Nashville</a>
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a five year $100,000 capacity sole source Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to Johnson, George Dan (Mr. Johnson) of Apple Valley, CA for the continued provision of highly specialized consulting services for the review, advisory, and consultation of the advisory board of experts overseeing the major seepage repair and rehabilitation projects within the Nashville District, primarily at Wolf Creek Dam and Center Hill Dam.<br><br>This procurement has been approved for other than full and open competition under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  <br><br>The work will require the consultant to review report designs, specifications, and provide input to the district staff on sufficiency of proposed methods to correct the seepage problems. The consultant will provide advice and consultation during the construction phase of these projects. The consultant will also make field visits to the sites with district staff.  <br><br>It has been determined that the Government will incur substantial duplication of costs for the consultant services described above if not obtained by the continued provision of Mr. Johnson.  Mr. Johnson has participated with the advisory panels for the past five years and is familiar with the history of these projects. Award to any contractor other than Mr. Johnson to perform the described services would require a substantial amount of time and cost for any other contractor to come up to speed with the advisory panels as it relates to the design and specifications of the proposed remedies. This substantial duplication of effort and its associated cost is not expected to be recovered through competition. It is therefore in the best interests to obtain the services described above by continuing to procure them from Mr. Johnson.   <br><br>The Federal Acquisition Regulations allow for the submission of capability statements from prospective offerors to show interest which shall be considered by the Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  This is not a request for capability statements or quotes.  However, the Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will consider any capability statements or quotes submitted by all responsible sources.  Depending on the evaluation result of the capability statements, the Contracting Officer will determine if this sole source action is justified or if a solicitation must be issued to interested firms.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.  If potential offerors choose to submit information, past performance and references regarding capability to perform these services must be provided along with the statement of capability.  The Government will not award a contract based on the information received, nor reimburse participants for information they provide. Information provided is strictly voluntary.  Please email capability statements or quotes to Isaac.J.Taylor@usace.army.mil@usace.army.mil.  Telephonic inquiries will not be honored.  The closing date for submission of capability statements or quotes is July 5, 2012, 8:00 AM Central Daylight Time.  <br>

<DESC>U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) intends to competitively establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) in accordance with FAR Part 16.703 with vendors who are capable of providing automotive and related vehicle parts, specialized tools, and accessories to repair and maintain approximately 1,600 vehicles and equipment managed by the 86th Vehicle Readiness Squadron (86 VRS) located at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. The contractor shall meet all minimum capability requirements and deliver all products required in the Specification/Statement of Need for vehicles/equipment included on the Vehicle Master List in a manner that supports 86 VRS&rsquo;s mission efficiently and effectively. The Government&rsquo;s minimum capability requirements, vital to successful accomplishment of the requirement, are:<br /><br />1. Response time: The contractor shall acknowledge all parts orders placed by the Government via electronic means within 24 hours of receipt, or the next business day. <br />2. Speed of service/parts shipments: Priority/emergency parts shall be shipped to the Government within two (2) business days of the contractor receiving all parts to fulfill the order requested by the Government. Routine/working stock parts shall be shipped to the Government within five (5) business days of the contractor receiving all parts to fulfill the order requested by the Government. <br />3. Accuracy of parts orders: All parts are inspected/verified for correctness prior to shipment to ensure that the parts received correspond to the parts ordered. 4. Quality of parts: All parts furnished by the contractor shall meet or exceed the quality of the part furnished on the original piece of equipment. If the requested part is not available, a suitable substitute will be provided that meets all Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) requirements. Rebuilt/remanufactured or used parts must conform to the original manufacturer's tolerance. If OEM is required for any reason, it must be provided by the contractor. <br />5. Parts warranties: The contractor shall convey to the Government a standard warranty properly funded as part of the procurement (i.e., included in the price of the part/supply).<br /><br />A basic ordering agreement is not a contract; it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting agency, or contracting office and contractor that contains (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future order under the basic ordering agreement. <br /><br />Issuance of BOAs will be based on evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth in the solicitation. Contractors issued a BOA may receive requests for technical and/or price proposals as requirements arise. The Government will determine from which BOA holders to request price and/or technical proposals; specific firm-fixed-price orders will be competed among them. Award of orders will be based on price and other factors as deemed desirable and set forth for each specific requirement. Each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, conditions, and pricing of the BOA. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount of volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement. Government funds are obligated only to the extent that a duly issued order creates such an obligation. If adequate competition cannot be obtained, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition to include non-BOA holders. <br />The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued under the BOA. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. A BOA may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the 700th Contracting Squadron may continue to place orders under the BOA. <br /><br />Please provide comments, questions, and concerns regarding the notice description, minimum capability requirements, Specification/Statement of Need, or Vehicle Master List to Ms. Christel Wittmer, Contracting Officer, 700 CONS/LGCB, email: christel.wittmer@ramstein.af.mil and A1C Nicholas Goldstein, Contract Specialist, 700 CONS/LGCB, email: nicholas.goldstein@ramstein.af.mil by June 29, 2012 at 9:00 AM Central Time.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has a requirement for recruitment and assessment of members of military Special Forces units for a research study.  A firm fixed price contract for a base year and 4 option years is anticipated and shall be awarded.  It is the Government's belief that only the Center for Research & Development possesses the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement.  It is the Government's intention to solicit and negotiate only with this source.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation; it is notice of intent to sole source a requirement.

Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-5.  

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT 689/90C Medical Center.   PR #:    689-13-1-371-0001         
            
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Initiate a new contract with the Center for Research and Development. The action being reviewed and approved is a new firm fixed price (FFP) contract.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (NCPTSD) at the VA CT Healthcare System is conducting studies of active duty, special operations military personnel in order to better understand why some individuals are more vulnerable to stress related psychological illnesses (such as PTSD) while others are less vulnerable and more stress resilient. This work requires ongoing, direct involvement with special operations units by individuals who have security clearances and who are officially associated with said units.  This means the NCPTSD needs to have a contract with people who have unique and ongoing access to these special operations units in order to facilitate NCPTSD research. The NCPTSD does not have this capability and, therefore, has used the Center for Research and Development (CR&D) in the past to accomplish NCPTSD research objectives.  CR&D has personnel with security clearances who have access to and who are actively involved with current collaborative research between NCPTSD and special operations units.  These CR&D personnel have been and are effective in facilitating NCPTSD research because they have years of experience with both the NCPTSD and in conducting operational research and are a known entity to the special military units.  These special units are reluctant to permit access to individuals they do not know; over the past few years the established track record of the NCPTSD/CR&D team have made this research possible. Since they know the personnel and trust them this permits the NCPTSD access to their units. Within the special operations community these relationships take years to cultivate; without them the NCPTSD could not continue its current research.  If the NCPTSD had to start over with a new company, it would require a minimum of 2 years to re-develop the special access that is currently available to the NCPTSD. This would represent a significant and unacceptable loss to the NCPTSD.

The specific services CR&D provides are: interfacing and meeting with key personnel in these units to explain the goals, hypotheses and designs of current and new NCPTSD research; coordination and recruitment of participants for the research; data collection and data entry on site for exporting to NCPTSD.  The time period and dates of performance are monthly and within each fiscal year. Data is delivered to NCPTSD at the end of each data collection cycle (typically monthly);  the total estimated value of these services is $33,000.00 per year. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 U.S.C. 3304 (a) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.
	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The Center for Research and Development is highly specialized in supplying services for research clinical data retrieval. CR&D is unique and represents the one responsible source  of a highly specialized service in that it has: A) personnel with security clearances at the SECRET and TOP SECRET level (including Secret Compartmented Information, SCI); and B)  over 10 years of experience conducting psychological, physiological and biological research in these special military environments. This is unique in that although many companies have personnel with clearances, they do not have personnel possessing both clearances and highly specialized experience in neurobiological work.  

The special units to which NCPTSD has access require some of the highest levels of security clearances that are possible to have (i.e. TS-SCI); this status, coupled with research experience and a history of working within these special units, makes CR&D unique to the needs of the NCPTSD.  Individuals who are not familiar with the culture of special military units may not realize that these special units are VERY reluctant to work with people they do not know.  Apart from our research group they have traditionally avoided letting any research groups into their systems for neurobiological research; the NCPTSD has had unique access over the years because we worked to establish these long-term relationships and have used the same personnel to maintain these research relationships with the units via CR&D.  NCPTSD is not aware of any other company that can provide this unique service.  It would cause unacceptable delays in NCPTSD capabilities to conduct research within these units if we had to start with a new company and restart the process of getting the special units to accept these new personnel. 

In summary, CR&D is the only firm capable of providing the services described above for the NCPTSD neurobiological studies work in elite military units without the VHA/NCPTSD experiencing a substantial delays in fulfilling its requirements and or a loss of access to special units that could not be expected to be recovered through competition. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:   Market research has not been conducted in conjunction with our request.  To our knowledge no other company has access for purposes of neurobiological research to these Special Military Units and Special Training sites. We have spoken with the command of each unit and have been informed that the NCPTSD relationship for research with such units is unique.  


7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  It is our belief that the price provided to the Government for this service is fair and reasonable. The cost to NCPTSD are based on labor costed at a doctoral rate of $143.00 per hour (which is significantly less than many doctoral rates used in government that are between $157.00 and $190.00 per hour) and costed at a non doctoral rate of $48.00 per hour.   Each year we anticipate that CR&D will facilitate the recruitment of 100 participants. In the past, the cost to the NCPTSD has been 20/hrs per week at the doctoral rate and 40 hours/week at the non doctoral rate.  This total cost per year is $31,812.00 and is fair and reasonable based upon NCPTSD experience with similar contracts.  In accordance with FAR 13.106-3, price analysis comparing current proposed prices to prices awarded under the expiring contract will be used by the Contracting Officer to make a positive determination of fair and reasonable pricing.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  A market research has not been conducted in conjunction with our request to the Center for Research and Development.  A sources sought notice will be posted in FBO.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Our previous research work has been performed by the Center for Research & Development and to maintain consistency in our research we would like the research team to remain intact and employ the same methods for recruitment, data collection and analysis.  The fact CR&D is familiar with NCPTSD protocols and current studies significantly helps us get the work done in a timely manner for presentation.  The Center for R&D has performed well for our previous studies; their work has been both timely and good research objectives.  

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Any sources responding to the sources sought posting will be forwarded on to the using services for possible future consideration.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The NCPTSD continues to actively survey and monitor developments in the military and research communities so as to be aware of any new companies that might meet the needs of the NCPTSD for these services.  The requirement will by synopsized to the Government Point of Entry (GPE), Federal Business Opportunities.  Responses will be forwarded to the requesting services.  The VA could pursue the ability to acquire security clearances for TS and TS-SCI related government work. This would significantly assist the NCPTSD to have direct access to units. However, these clearances do take time (average time for getting a person a clearance level of TS is two years) but in the long run would be very useful to NCPTSD.

At present, approval for using CR&D is sought for more than one year due to the fact that our current research protocols are based on projects requiring 3 years of effort. Continuing with CR&D would prevent an unacceptable disruption in both data collection and our ability to complete projects in a timely manner.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Capitol Healthcare Network (VISN 5) intends to solicit proposal from contractors to provide housing first advisory and technical assistance and training services to Veterans who are homeless.  The DC VAMC anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about July 16, 2012, with a closing date for proposals on or about July 30, 2012.  The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments. This requirement is 100% set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) to provide the service. The NAIC Code for this solicitation is 541611.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is taking decisive action toward its goal of ending homelessness among our Nation's Veterans. To achieve this goal, the VA has developed a Five-Year Plan to End Homelessness among Veterans, designed to assist every eligible homeless Veteran as well as Veterans at risk for homelessness, to receive appropriate services. The VA shall help Veterans acquire safe housing, needed treatment services, opportunities to return to employment, and benefits assistance.

To eliminate homelessness among Veterans, VA shall continue to move towards a Housing First approach in its HUD/VASH programs.  All Case Managers and Substance Use Disorder Specialists in the HUD/VASH program are to have training in clinical approaches relevant to the population, including the Housing First model.  Outreach and education about HUD/VASH to all internal and external stakeholders is a critical component of the elimination of homelessness among Veterans.  To effectively accomplish this, HUD/VASH Case Managers and Outreach staff must use a Housing First approach, which is a highly-effective intervention strategy that utilizes assertive community outreach combined with a low-demand approach that does not require the usual "housing readiness" conditions of sobriety or full compliance with mental health treatment as a condition of acceptance or continued stay.

The government will use a best value source selection method under Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and anticipates making a single award of firm-fixed price contract for this requirement for a period of twelve months.

To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration data base at www.ccr.gov.  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit that CCR website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays should they be selected for a contract award. Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist using the e-mail link provided.

<a href="mailto:patricia.l.williams@nasa.gov">Patricia L. Williams</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) to determine potential sources to diagnose and repair or remanufacture malfunctioning electronic input-output processor (IOP) circuit cards for the Research Flight Control Computer Assembly (RFCCA) of the RASCAL JUH-60 research helicopter. The RFCCA was designed and manufactured by Boeing Defense and Space Group, Helicopters Division and Lear Astronics Corp. under contract to NASA Ames Research Center in the 1990s. The RFCCA was designed and manufactured to the same standards as contemporary production military helicopter flight control electronic hardware. The U.S. Government owns the design of the RFCCA and retains schematics of the major circuit cards. However, detailed design documentation, including Gerber files and bill of materials for the IOP cards are not available. Some reverse engineering may be required to reconstruct required detailed design information. Two fully functional RFCCA units were delivered to NASA along with one qualification test unit. One RFCCA remains fully functional, and one suffers from intermittent IOP card malfunctions. The qualification unit is not functional. NASA also maintains two test benches for the RFCCA that are used as interfaces for hardware in the loop simulation laboratories and for conducting system functional and diagnostic tests. One RFCCA and one test bench can be made available to support diagnosis, repair, and/or remanufacture of IOP cards. NASA ARC anticipates that work will be accomplished in two phases. The first phase will likely include a review of RFCCA existing design data and functionality, investigation and documentation of IOP card malfunctions, possible reverse engineering of unavailable required design data, and development of a plan to repair and/or remanufacture fully functional IOP cards. The first phase may be awarded as a cost reimbursable contract. The second phase will include the repair and/or remanufacture of a fixed number of IOP cards. The outputs of the first phase should reduce the technical risk of the second phase sufficiently that it can be awarded as a fixed-price contract. The objectives of the current RFI are as follows: A.	Determine potential industry sources for the technical and manufacturing expertise required to diagnose and repair military helicopter flight control computer hardware. B.	Gather information from industry on the information, tools, supplies and techniques required to diagnose and repair military helicopter flight control computer hardware. C.	Obtain information to help the Government develop an effective Request for Proposal to diagnose and repair and/or remanufacture IOP cards for the RASCAL RFCCA. More specifically, for item B, the objective of this RFI is to determine: 1.	What kinds of non-invasive and invasive inspection techniques are available to diagnose the source of IOP circuit board malfunctions? 2.	What type of test equipment is required to diagnose IOP circuit board malfunctions and to verify correct functionality? 3.	What kinds of engineering skills and techniques are available to reverse engineer required missing circuit board design data? 4.	Can modern manufacturing processes be used to remanufacture circuit boards designed and built 20 years ago? 5.	What options are available to replace obsolete electronic components? Responses: This section contains all of the information required to submit a response.  No additional forms or other materials are required.

<p>The Federal Communications Commission's ("FCC") Office of Communications Business Opportunities (OCBO) is conducting market research on capable service providers (e.g., for-profit businesses, FFRDCs and not-for-profits, educational institutions) and their practices with respect to the FCC's Performance Work Statement Abstract (Abstract) set forth below.  The abstract below, addresses services currently being considered for procurement that concern analyses, surveys, and polls on how the critical information needs of the American public are being served.</p>
<p>The information received will be reviewed by the FCC to assess whether a procurement should be conducted and a solicitation method, the content of any solicitation, and the contract type selected.  The information received may inform multiple FCC procurements.  This RFI is for information gathering and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal or other solicitation for offer.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  All information (other than the response to item no. 10 below) will be treated as in the public domain.  Therefore, respondents should submit responses to item no. 10 separately.  No other part of a response will be regarded as having been submitted confidentially and should not contain proprietary or otherwise confidential information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Specific information sought includes:</strong></span></p>
<p>1.	Company information, including name, address, URL, and DUNS number; <br />2.	If you are a small business, company size information (including number of employees and approximate annual revenue) and SBA program participation;<br />3.	A point of contact for follow-up information, including a phone number and e-mail address; <br />4.	A brief description of your capabilities, experience, and existing or related services that you provide, as related to the Abstract; <br />5.

Information that you believe should be addressed in a developed Performance Work Statement or that that would be beneficial in preparing a proposal; <br />7.	Suggested performance standards, including whether they are commercial or industry standards or developed for a prior, specific acquisition or procurement vehicle;  <br />8.	Different approaches to achieving the object of the work set forth in the Abstract, including your views as to approaches that would best lend themselves to fixed pricing; and<br />9.	The subject matter expertise which, in your estimation, would be required to best achieve the objectives sought by the Abstract.<br />10.	 If possible on the basis of the existing Abstract, a range of contract pricing for each enumerated item in the Abstract that would inspire your company to compete for a contract.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Performance Work Statement Abstract [Draft]:</strong></span></p>
<p>In order to develop policy that advances the goal of diversity, the Commission intends to conduct or commission research that illuminates the relationship between market entry barriers and the satisfaction of critical information needs of local communities.  The Commission will consider offers that respond to each of five (5) proposed study requirements, as separate studies or as a group or groups of studies.  The proposed studies are:<br /> <br />1.	Qualitative Analysis of Communication Ecologies and Critical Information Needs. <br />a.	The FCC is looking for an entity capable of performing field research in a minimum of six markets (small, medium, and large), involving focus groups, in-depth interviews, surveys, and the construction of relevant databases to determine whether and how FCC regulated and related non-regulated media construct news and public affairs to provide for critical information needs (CIN). <br />b.	This research includes proposing a methodology for determining the media available in any market, the extend to which different media respond to the critical information needs of the American public, for conducting content analysis and for selecting target markets.  <br />2.	Survey of Communication Ecologies and Performance Regarding Critical Information Needs.<br />a.	The FCC is looking for an entity capable of performing field research in a minimum of six markets (small, medium, and large), involving focus groups, in-depth interviews, surveys, and/or other proposed methodologies to determine how different Americans construct their media environment, and to what extent they rely on the Legacy Media and/or New Media to acquire critical information.<br />b.	Propose and justify a methodology for selecting target markets and conducting field research to determine the range of media the public relies on for acquiring critical information.  <br />3.	Survey/Analysis of Market Entry Barriers and Critical Information Needs.<br />a.	The FCC is looking for an entity capable of performing an analysis of survey research examining whether there are market entry barriers to participate in the media, telecommunications and information industry.  <br />b.	Is market size a factor and if there are barriers to entry, do the barriers have an impact on the provision of critical information needs?<br />4.	National Multi-Lingual Poll on Critical Information Needs. <br />a.	The FCC is looking for an entity capable of constructing, performing and analyzing a national poll to gather data on whether Americans get their critical information needs met by FCC-regulated and related industries.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice for information from companies who can provide parts and service for automation line and equipment needed to connect existing contracted laboratory equipment at the VA Medical Center in Philadelphia.  The automation equipment is being purchased to help the lab fulfill its customer needs to report laboratory testing in a timely manner. The current configuration is manual transport of the specimen from one section of the laboratory to another for additional testing. The automation is a robotic system of transportation of the laboratory specimens from pre-analytics (specimen receipt and centrifugation), analytics (specimen testing) and finally post-analytics (storage). Only Beckman Coulter automation is currently configurable with the current equipment.
        This is part of a standardization being conducted in the VISN 4 laboratories.  We currently have 2
         Beckman Coulter DXI Immunoassay analyzers and 3 DXC general chemistry analyzers which are 
         maintained under contract VA244-BP-0077 for the next 4 years. The parts provided would have to
        connect with the Beckman Coulter contracted equipment.

<DESC><div>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This is not a solicitation or a request for proposal and no contract will be awarded from this notice. This posting is for market research purposes only. Large businesses need not respond. The General Services Administration, Region 2, Public Buildings Service, is conducting market research to determine if there are any Small Businesses that have the current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel, and capability to perform the work described herein.<br /><br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>The General Services Administration, Region 2, Public Buildings Service, is seeking to modernize eight elevators (two freight and six passenger elevators) at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House located at One Bowling Green, New York, NY. &nbsp;These elevators are experiencing frequent control and drive systems failures and require more intensive servicing of equipment. &nbsp;In addition, there have been an increasing number of entrapments and passenger complaints. &nbsp;The modernization of these elevators will improve the safety, reliability, performance, elevator system&rsquo;s energy efficiency and ride quality for the building&rsquo;s tenants and visitors. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Government will utilize two-phase design-build selection procedures in accordance with FAR 36.3 for this acquisition. &nbsp;The offerors selected to participate in Phase 2 of the acquisition will be requested to provide a design concept for the modernization, and to the maximum extent practicable, incorporate non-proprietary equipment and controls. &nbsp;This will ensure that when the Government subsequently contracts for elevator maintenance services for the modernized elevators, there will be adequate competition.<br /><br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>All qualified Small Businesses are encouraged to respond. The Government will not pay for any information received from this Sources Sought Notice. One of the main purposes of this Sources Sought Notice is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining if a Set-Aside is the acceptable strategy for the procurement. The appropriate NAICS Code is 238290 (Other Building Equipment Contractors) with a size standard of $14.0 Million.</div>
<div><br /><br />Interested parties should send expressions of interest, no later than close of business June 26, 2012, to Nicholas S. Uom, Contracting Officer, at nicholas.uom@gsa.gov.</div>

The contractor shall provide Kingdom Suite software license, support, maintenance, and software upgrades.
This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13.  The proposed action is for products for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy the agency's requirement. 
IHS GLOBAL INC. is the only source for this data that can satisfy the USGS requirements.
There are no other sources for continued software support for the Kingdom Suite.

<DESC><strong>SYNOPSIS:<br /></strong>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG).
<p>The USCG Aviation Logistics Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers described as follows:</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:<br /></strong>Purchase of spare APS-143C (V) 3 airborne pulse compression surveillance and imaging radar components (the Receiver/Transmitter (R/T) P/N 737-4000-001 and the MMR Signal Processor, P/N 737-3000-001) used on the USCG Maritime Patrol Aircraft (HC-144A). This system was designed to provide the airborne platform with the means to search for and detect surface targets while performing over water surveillance. The APS-143C (V) 3 radar system consists of three major components: the receiver/transmitter, the signal data processor, and the antenna pedestal. The Receiver/Transmitter (R/T) (737-4000-001) generates linear FM dispersed or Continuous Wave (CW) pulses of X-Band Radio Frequency (RF) energy and detects, compresses, filters and amplifies the low-level echoes received from this pulse. The R/T has several modes of RF operation. Each mode is controlled from the Signal processor (SP)(737-3000-001) via an ARINC-429 data link. The Antenna Pedestal (A/P) (737-5000-002) focuses and directs energy furnished by the R/T. It is pitch and roll stabilized and can operate at 6, 12, 30 and 60 rpm in continuous scan mode and in a sector scan mode. These operations are controlled by an analog control signal supplied by the SP. The SP receives platform stabilization information (pitch / roll) from the navigation system over a data bus. The stabilization information is filtered, scaled, limited and converted to analog signals that are utilized by the A/P to control antenna elevation positioning. Elevation Tilt control of the Antenna is controlled via the SP. The original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the APS-143C (V) 3 Radar System is Telephonics Corporation (64694), 815 Broad Hollow Road, Farmingdale NY 11735. All components should be new with zero time and have FAA form 8130 with traceable to the OEM. All components should be new with zero time and have FAA form 8130 with traceable to the OEM. Also, state approximate lead-time for acquiring your product.</p>
<p><strong>REPLIES:<br /></strong>Responses to this notice should include company name, address, and telephone number, point of contact (POC), details on company quality systems and include documentation that provides traceability to the OEM for each part, complete product details, brochures, etc., which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment and options. Please state the approximate lead-time for acquiring your product and the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Responses can be for all or for a few of the part numbers listed.</p>
<p>Please provide the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Please respond to the following questions: <br />(1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? <br />(2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? <br />(4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? <br />(5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? <br />(6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? <br />(7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? <br />(8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers?<br />(9) If possible, any POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions. After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the USCG still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO).</p>

This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG).
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:<br /></strong>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates thirteen HC-144A aircraft each powered by two CT7-9C3 turboprop engines. The end state for the fleet size is still under review but could include as many as 36 assets. The HC-144A aircraft is manufactured by EADS CASA based in Seville, Spain, the CT7-9C3 turboprop engines are manufactured by General Electric, Aviation Division based out of Lynn, MA, USA. The base CASA CN-235-300M provides the foundation for the USCG HC-144A aircraft. The USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft and its CT7-9C3 turboprop engines are operated differently from general aviation in support of such Coast Guard missions as: Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, Logistic Support, and Law Enforcement Missions. These missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments which accelerate corrosion on airframe structures, engines and other components. The aircraft, the engines and their components are inspected by USCG personnel in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).</p>
<p>The USCG Aviation Logistics Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers described as follows:</p>
<p><strong>USCG OBJECTIVES:<br /></strong>To establish a firm-fixed price contract to purchase aircraft parts (see listing).Only the exact part numbers listed in the schedule will be accepted. This requirement must be restricted to authorized sources of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or firms who can effectively demonstrate their ability to provide the components and obtain the proprietary data required meeting form, fit, and function of the units and written documentation that traces the manufacturing data of each component to the OEM. The USCG requires that distributors or other potential sources be ASA-100 certified, or in compliance with other quality systems listed in FAA Advisory Circular 00-56A.These requirements are necessary in order for the USCG to maintain the capability to adequately support all USCG missions.</p>

The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available services that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG).
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG/CG) currently operates thirteen HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft each powered by two CT7-9C3 turboprop engines which use the model 14RF-37 Propeller assembly. The aircraft is manufactured by AIRBUS MILITARY (formerly EADS CASA) in Seville, Spain. These aircraft are procured under the authority of the Coast Guard Aviation Program Management Office. While the base CASA CN-235-300M aircraft provides the foundation for the Coast Guard HC-144A, changes to base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235-300M. The end state for the fleet size is still under review but could include as many as 36 assets. The projected number of Coast Guard assets over the next five years includes up to twenty operational HC-144A aircraft with each averaging 1200 flight hours annually. The components listed are manufactured by Hamilton Sundstrand based out of Windsor locks CT, USA.</p>
<p>USCG OBJECTIVES:<br />To obtain a five year firm fixed price contract for services from a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized overhaul and repair center or equivalent to effectively inspect, test, troubleshoot, clean, overhaul, repair, and modify, the listed Hamilton Sundstrand components to current OEM configurations while maintaining any CG specific requirements for return to service in a Ready For Issue (RFI) condition and CG operational use. The components must remain configured for installation on USCG HC-144A aircraft. Responses can be for all or for a few of the part numbers listed<br />To have all Components listed inspected, repaired, modified or overhauled IAW OEM repair specifications, and Component Maintenance Manuals, including Revisions, Service Bulletins, Modifications, and Amendments. <br />To have all Components listed overhauled, repaired, or modified for return to service with FAA airworthiness Form 8130-3 or other FAA authorized airworthiness form attached. <br />To have all Components listed overhauled, repaired, or modified for return to service within 60 calendar days after receipt of material (ARM) at contractors repair facility. <br />To obtain and maintain a current list and status of all OEM Overhaul, Repair and Component Maintenance Manuals (CMM), including Revisions (Rev), Temporary Revisions (TR), Service Bulletins (SB), Modifications (MOD), Amendments (AMD) or other specifications applicable to the overhaul, repairs and modification of the listed assemblies and its components <br />To track and document calendar time, flight time, flight/life cycles, all work and services performed on these components as required under USCG ACMS. Tracking provides significant component historical records of component installations, removals, overhauls, repairs, and modifications including component transit, storage, status, and locations. ACMS tracking provides and an effective means of configuration control to maintain the integrity of OEM overhaul/high time hourly intervals including flight and life cycle limits as applicable. For configuration control prior written approval of the CG Contracting Officer shall be obtained for any configuration changes to propeller assemblies, blades, and components. <br />REPLIES:<br />All interested parties should respond via email to: Linda Clark, HC-144A Contract Specialist at Linda.D.Clark@uscg.mil<br />Nomenclature and parts numbers that will be on the schedule are as follows:</p>

This J&A is also available at http://www.usbr.gov/mso/aamd/doing-business-acquisitions-noncompetitive.html.  
Introduction:  As required by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.303-2, this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOTFOC) is prepared to document the facts and rationale justifying the authority cited in Paragraph 4 to negotiate with a sole offeror for the above requirement.  This JOTFOC follows the format and contains all the information required under FAR 6.303-2.
1.  Identification of Agency, Contracting Activity and Document.   
Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Regional Office, Justification for other than Full and Open Competition.
2.  Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved.  
This J&A is for the negotiation and award of a sole source modification through other than full and open competition.  The equipment being procured consists of additional quantities of specifically designed programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and hydraulic control manifolds.  Modification No. 0006 will be negotiated with Precision Machine & Supply, Inc., 3218 East Main Street, Lewiston ID 83501.  The independent Government cost estimate is $397,995.00 for the additional equipment.  
3.  Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet Agency's Need
Background
Various contractors designed and manufactured pressure-regulating valves (PRVs) as part of the seventeen generators at Hoover Dam, located near Boulder City, Nevada.  The various contractors all installed their own designs at Hoover Dam.  For example, Pelton designed and manufactured the PRV on unit A2, while Allis Chalmers manufactured the PRV on unit A3.  The A2 Pelton design operates by raising a piston, while the A3 Chalmers design lowers a piston.  In order words, the PRVs operate in opposite directions.  There are other examples of non-standard PRV designs throughout the power plant.
Under Contract No. 07CP308064, programmable logic controllers were installed on the generating units.  These new programmable logic controllers made it possible to control a modern hydraulic system on the PRVs.
Contract No. R06PC30062 was awarded to Precision Machine & Supply Inc. (Precision Machine).  The contractor was required to disassemble, remove, rebuild, and re-install PRVs (this entire process is called an overhaul) for various units at Hoover Dam.  Hoover Dam identifies the components of the PRVs as either above or below the water.  The goal of this contract was to return the 70-year old PRVs to "like-new" condition, both above and below the water.  The principle components of this work included:
(1)	Repair or replace damaged surfaces;
(2)	Repair or replace check and flow control valves;
(3)	Surface coating; and 
(4)	Test operations
In order to improve safety and reliability of the PRV equipment, Hoover Dam began also modernizing PRVs in 2007.  The modernization required the following:
(1)	Changing the control of the PRV from mechanical to digital;
(2)	Replacing the components operated by lake water and the mechanical linkages to the turbine with oil-hydraulic systems and digital hydraulic drivers; and 
(3)	Linking computer intelligence electronically from the UCM PLCs to the pressure regulating valves' controls to operate the modernized PRV.
The work below the water was unchanged, but the contractor added the following work:
(1)	Design, build, and install a new headcover, oil-hydraulic cylinder, and stop tower;
(2)	Design, build, and install a PLC control system to operate the PRV that communicates with the UCM control system;
(3)	Design, manufacture, and install a control manifold to properly distribute the oil for moving the cylinder; and
(4)	Design, manufacture, and install a hydraulic oil pressure system and piping (HPU).  Components included the following:  7.5HP motor, oil pump, reservoir, accumulator to supply stored energy to the oil system, hydraulic pump, pressure switch, solenoid valves, piping, motor starter, and oil spill containment.
The modernized PRV design removed the mechanical components above the old headcover.  The design did not require the components' restoration and re-installation since the hydraulic cylinder and stop tower replaced these parts on the new digitally linked PRV.  
Under Contract No. R06PC30062, Precision Machine developed the overall design for the PRV modernization including the subassemblies (hydraulic control manifold, programmable logic controller, headcover, cylinders, etc.) and changes internal to the PRV housing and valve in order to meet the Government's specified functional design criteria.
Current Requirement
To date, Hoover Dam has overhauled and modernized five PRVs (N3, N7, N2, N4, and A6).  The modernized PRVs are standardized and the components and operation are identical.  Under Contract No. R11PC30062 (which was awarded to Precision Machine), Hoover Dam will overhaul and modernize nine additional PRVs (N1, N8, A8, A5, N6, A3, A1, A9, and N5). Three PRVs were refurbished to original specifications, including mechanical linkage to wicket gates and lake water hydraulic operation.  These were the A4 PRV (2001 PRV overhaul) and A2 and A7  PRVs (2008 PRV overhauls).  The original mechanical linkage and water-operated hydraulic components at these valves will require replacement with digitally controlled, oil-operated hydraulic components at a future date.  Hoover Dam has received funding in order to procure additional PLCs and manifolds which would be necessary in order to modernize the last three PRVs (A2, A4, and A7) at a future date.  Precision Machine and its subcontractors (American Governor and Controlled Motion Solutions (Comoso) designed the critical electronic and hydraulic controls for the modernized PRVs.  Hoover Dam cannot procure these items under a competitive contract because the design of these items is proprietary.  Furthermore, Precision Machine, Comoso, and American Governor have exclusivity agreements to the design and systems.      
4.  Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  
The statutory authority for use of other than full and open competition for this transaction is as follows: [check the applicable FAR 6.302  authority.]
[X]	FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1)).
[  ]	FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency (10 U.S.C 2304(c)(2) or 41 U.S.C 253(c)(2)). (This justification may be made and approved after contract award when preparation and approval prior to award would unreasonably delay the acquisition.)
[  ]	FAR 6.302-3 Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services (10 U.S.C 2304(c)(3) or 41 U.S.C 253(c)(3)).
[  ]	FAR 6.302-4 International agreement (10 U.S.C 2304(c)(4) or 41 U.S.C 253(c)(4)).
[  ]	FAR 6.302-6 National security (10 U.S.C 2304(c)(6) or 41 U.S.C 253(c)(6)).
[  ]	FAR 6.302-7 Public interest (10 U.S.C 2304(c)(7) or 41 U.S.C 253(c)(7)). (Requires approval of head of the executive agency.)
5.  Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications/Nature of Acquisition Requiring Use of Cited Authority.
This procurement action will be negotiated with Precision Machine, 3218 East Main Street, Lewiston ID 83501.  Under Contract No. R06PC30062, the modernized PRVs were converted from a mechanical to computer controlled hydraulic oil system to operate the PRV at the desired rate of opening and closure to meet the Government's design criteria.  Precision Machine developed the entire system.  The contractor developed the design, manufactured new replacement components, refurbished embedded existing components and made necessary changes to existing components for compatibility to function with the modernized PRV.  Precision Machine developed the design for the modernized PRV and worked in conjunction with American Governor and Comoso to provide fully functioning units.  Precision Machine, Comoso, and American Governor have exclusivity agreements to the design and systems.  
Nine additional PRVs will be modernized under Precision Machine's current Contract No. R11PC30062.  After completion of the work under Contract No. R11PC30062, there will remain three PRVs which will not be modernized.  In order to modernize and standardize the remaining PRVs, three additional programmable logic controllers must be obtained.  The components must be identical in design, manufacture, assembly, and function to those already provided for the modernized PRVs.  The technical data to assemble and configure the components into a fully functioning system is not available since Precision Machine developed the overall design to modernize PRVs.     
It is more economical to procure the additional control systems and manifolds under one contract rather than possibly procure, negotiate, and award three separate purchase orders/contracts to obtain the required PLCs and hydraulic manifolds required to modernize the three remaining PRVs and to ensure that they are all standardized.  Additionally, it is economical to procure these two critical components under a contract modification to Precision Machine's current contract rather than incur additional procurement costs to solicit, negotiate, and award a separate sole source contract.  Additional procurement lead time would also be required.  These are additional risks related to the required hardware and software becoming obsolete which could then require a new design and result in non-standardized PRVs.
Precision Machine designed the modernized PRV system.  Precision Machine has declared on their drawings that this design is proprietary.  Comoso and American Governor provided designs and schematics in response to Precision Machine's requirements.  Precision Machine required that the Comoso hydraulic manifold correctly control the flow of high pressure hydraulic oil into and out of the hydraulic cylinder in response to commands received from the American Governor programmable logic controller.  Comoso has also declared their design of the hydraulic systems proprietary, as it was specifically designed to meet the unique requirements for Hoover Dam's modernized PRV.  One particular subassembly of the new hydraulic manifold was built by Precision Machine using parts provided by Comoso.  American Governor designed the digital control systems by utilizing non-proprietary, off-the-shelf hardware and software.  American Governor adapted project-specific software as needed to control the specific style of PRV mechanism in use for the modernized PRVs.  There is a licensing agreement between Precision Machine, American Governor, and Comoso.  In order to obtain the PLC systems and manifolds to realize the benefits of standardization mentioned earlier, the Government will need to purchase the programmable logic controllers and manifolds through Precision Machine.  Due to safety and reliability requiring standardized PRV equipment, the Government will achieve best quality by modifying the existing contract to purchase the equipment.  A significant duplication of effort would be required for different companies to establish their own designs that matched the existing, modernized, PRV design.  The projected lead time for Comoso to supply the hydraulic control manifolds is approximately 15 weeks after receipt of an order.  The lead time for American Governor to supply the programmable logic controllers is approximately 6 months from receipt of an order.   
It is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays and substantial duplication of cost to the Government, which would not be recovered through competition.  Another source would have to reverse engineer Precision Machine's designed hydraulic manifold controls and programmable logic controllers.  
6.  Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as Possible. 
Pursuant to FAR 5.101(a), the proposed modification action was posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.
7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price. 
The contracting officer will ensure that the items described herein are negotiated at a fair and reasonable price to the Government.  A detailed price analysis will be performed.  Information other than cost or pricing data may be obtained and cost analysis performed, if appropriate.   
8.  Market Survey. 
In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(d)(2), this requirement has been synopsized.  Industry was advised of the pending sole source procurement and inquiries were solicited from interested parties.  No sources expressed interest in this sole source procurement.  As previously stated, efforts to obtain competition for this action are not feasible since other sources would have to reverse engineer Precision Machine's designed hydraulic manifold controls and programmable logic controllers.  
9.  Additional Supporting Facts for Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition.
FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A) provides that highly specialized services may be deemed available only from the original source when it is likely that award to any other source would result in "substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition."  The Government has already paid for the design for the modernized PRVs.  As stated previously, Hoover Dam's goal is to standardize all PRVs for safety and reliability.  The same design can be used to modernize the remaining PRVs and therefore will not result in any additional design costs.
Because Precision Machine developed the design to modernize the PRVs, technical data is not available to obtain competition for this requirement. The hydraulic control manifolds and programmable logic controllers were originally designed specifically to modernize PRVs N3, N7, N2, N4, and A6.  Any competing contractor would not be able to provide the required items without accomplishing a significant and unnecessary amount of work to reverse engineer the electronic and hydraulic controls since the items must be standardized and compatible with existing modernized PRVs, as well as the nine PRVs which will be modernized under Contract No. R06PC30062.  Any competing contractor would not be able to provide the required items without accomplishing a significant and unnecessary amount of work to reverse engineer the electronic and hydraulic controls since the items must be standardized and compatible with existing modernized PRVs.  Award to another source would cost the Government time with regards to a possible learning curve and time to be able to satisfy Hoover Dam's requirements to modernize and standardize PRVs. 
If the additional programmable logic controllers and hydraulic control manifolds are not procured timely, there is significant risk that hardware and software could become obsolete if manufacturers change or discontinue making particular components.  Different software and hardware issues could create compatibility issues and possibly require a different design and result in non-standardized modernized PRVs.  All hardware components will remain identical.  This will eliminate the possibility of having different hardware versions in future programmable logic controllers as hardware manufacturers update their product lines.  The programmable logic controller software for all of the units will remain identical.  If future programmable logic controllers were supplied with different hardware versions, then different software may also be required to operate each programmable logic controller.  Buying all of the programmable logic controllers now will eliminate the possibility of multiple software versions.
American Governor developed the software utilized in the programmable logic controllers.  Hoover Dam has received the license to use the software.  A license would not be required for the additional quantities to be acquired under this procurement action.    
10.  Listing of Sources Expressing Interest in Acquisition.   
No sources expressed an interest in the acquisition as a result of the sources sought notice published on the FedBizOpps website.
11.  Action Taken to Remove and Overcome Barriers to Competition.  
For this procurement action, there is no alternative to the recommended action.
12.  Approvals.  The supporting data, which is the responsibility of the Bureau of Reclamation technical personnel and forms the basis for this justification, have been certified as complete and accurate by means of the below signature on this document.  As required by FAR 6.303-2(a)(12) and 6.304(1), (a) the contracting officer certifies that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of her knowledge and belief and (b) the signatures demonstrate the certifications and approvals necessary for this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition.

<DESC>This Notice of Intent is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes; however, in accordance with FAR Part 13 and Part 6.302-1, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to award a sole source delivery order based on the authority of FAR 6.302-1 "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". FEMA intends to award this delivery order to Textron, Inc., c/o Werres Corporation for the purchase of two Cushman Shuttle/Bellhop # 6E carriers and one Cushman Titan Model 634. These products are considered commercial items in accordance with FAR Part 2. This action is being performed in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) which states, "For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available". A Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been approved by the Contracting Officer and is provided as an attachment to this notice.
<p>Two Cushman Shuttle/Bellhop # 6E carriers and one Cushman Titan Model 634 are needed by DHS, FEMA, MWEOC to move people, tools and supplies throughout the facility. MWEOC has standardized its' fleet of electric vehicles by utilizing Cushman products. This standardization eliminated the need to stock spare parts for several manufacturer products which saves valuable warehouse space. It also removed the need to train personnel to use different brands of electric vehicles which promotes familiarity and ease of use. The Cushman Dealer who provides these electric vehicles must be within a 50 mile radius of MWEOC in order to ensure repairs and/or servicing of these vehicles can be completed quickly and that warranties are honored. Werres Corporation in Frederick, MD is believed to be the only Cushman dealer within a 50 mile radius of MWEOC; however, any Cushman dealer located within a 50 mile radius of zip code 20135, and capable of providing the required products, is requested to contact Phyllis Woodward via email at Phyllis.Woodward@fema.dhs.gov or by fax to 540-542-2631, no later than 4:00 PM on July 6, 2012. Capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

The workshop is the first step in enabling DOE to learn of any commercial interest either in operating the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) to continue to enrich uranium or in utilizing all or part of the PGDP facilities for other commercial purposes, particularly for reuse/reindustrialization. Non-DOE Governmental entities interested in utilizing all or part of the PGDP facilities are also encouraged to attend the workshop.<br /><br />The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) currently leases the PGDP from DOE and operates the PGDP to enrich uranium. In the event that USEC will return all, or essentially all, of the PGDP and relinquish its right to lease the PGDP, which may occur in the next few years, the opportunity may exist for private industry to lease or purchase PDGP facilities or land either to continue to enrich uranium or to utilize individual facilities (e.g., buildings, warehouses, machine shops, utilities) for other commercial purposes. The workshop will include an overview and technical discussion on the potentially available PGDP facilities, land, and personal property, followed by a site tour. Up to two (2) representatives from each entity may attend the site tour and must provide verification that they are United States citizens. The workshop also will offer the opportunity for individual one-on-one meetings between DOE representatives and interested parties/Companies/Governmental Entities.&nbsp; Those&nbsp;interested in attending the workshop must RSVP to Robert "Buz" Smith, U.S. Department of Energy, <a href="mailto:Robert.smith@lex.doe.gov">Robert.smith@lex.doe.gov</a> no later than 14 days after the date of this announcement. Companies/Governmental Entities interested in one-on-one meetings, should so indicate in their RSVP. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for services to be provided to DOE under a contract. Further, DOE's conduct of a workshop or the information provided at or in support of the workshop does not and should not be construed as obligating or in any way binding DOE to take or not to take any action with regard to the lease, sale or transfer of real or personal property. <br /><br />Information on the PPPO can be found at: <a href="http://www.pppo.energy.gov/">http://www.pppo.energy.gov/</a>.

Therefore, the system must be capable of both providing flow rates for both capillary and microbore LC separation configuration for measurements by ICP-MS and ESI/MS/MS. In summary, the nano flow system must be capable of nano, capillary, and micro-bore configurations and with the appropriate autosampler and column temperature control options in order to maintain essential group research and development capabilities. This capability is essential to matching the liquid flow rate capabilities (20 nL/min - 50 &micro;L/min) to the sample introduction system on existing ICP-MS (3 Thermo Fischer &amp; 1 Thermo Elemental) and ESI/MS/MS (2 AB Sciex) instrumentation used for the identification and quantification measurements of unknown species in NIST SRMs vital for the NIST healthcare research initiative. This arrangement will insure efficient transfer of existing and newly developed measurement methods currently in use in both the NIST Gaithersburg and Charleston laboratories. These methods include the use of hyphenated analytical methods relying upon liquid chromatography interfaced to ICP-MS and ESI/MS/MS for simultaneous or sequential measurements of chromatographic separations. Similarly, there is a need for the Inorganic Chemical Metrology Group to share chromatography based separation methods and access data and experiments across a common Liquid Chromatography platform. The required instrument is critical to maintaining high resolution liquid chromatographic separation integrity at UPLC pressures (10,000 psi) across the different mass spectrometry instrumentation either simultaneously or sequentially. The flexibility of the Dionex system to provide a separation platform over a wide range of flow rates which are compatible with the cross platform instrumentation is unique to the Dionex system. No other instrument manufacturer can provide a SINGLE Liquid Chromatography system that satisfies the Government's minimum specifications. This arrangement will help NIST to comply with certain aspects of the NIST quality system and allow for routine testing of comparability between the NIST Gaithersburg and NIST Charleston laboratories.</p>
<p>Thermo Electron North America LLC is the only vendor capable of providing the required Nano Flow High Performance Liquid Chromatography System in order to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements. Thermo Electron is the sole manufacturer and distributor.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by July 6, 2012, 3:30 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Chemical Sterilization Indicators. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<strong> Anticipated selection date is December 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Jim Quinn, Clinical Analyst, james.e.quinn@amedd.army.mil 210-292-3270 and<br />Mrs. Sarah Allen, Clinical Analyst, Sarah.L.Allen@amedd.army.mil 210-292-3287.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Chemical Sterilization Indicators. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,904,624.151,904,624.15. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, 101 of the total 205 line items account for 68% ($1,300,330.08) of the total volume in sales $1,904,624.15 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide <strong>an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Jim Quinn, Clinical Analyst, james.e.quinn@amedd.army.mil and <br />Mrs. Sarah Allen, Clinical Analyst, Sarah.L.Allen@amedd.army.mil .</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO South via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO South reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.<br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.<br /><br />Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. </strong></p>

Vendor must carry a supply of products that monitors the sterilization through Mechanical, Chemical and Biological means as recommended in AAMI ST79; 2010(R) - Comprehensive guide to steam sterilization and sterility assurance in Health Care Facilities. <br />4. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Chemical Sterilization Indicators. Vendor must provide the DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number has been applied for.<br />5. Vendor must have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Chemical Sterilization Indicators, or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements.<br />6. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off the DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative when pricing is requested in Phase III. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in Phase III for all products will be disqualified.<br />7. Vendor must indicate country from which each line item is a product, IAW Trade Agreements Act. Vendors having existing DAPA numbers must also ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country in the DAPA Management System.</p>
<p>Phase II Clinical Performance Evaluation<br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO South, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the specific CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation in Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after issue of notice, and arrive at the designated addresses for each MTF by 5:00 PM local time before the 30th calendar day. Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor must send the MMESO South verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. Fifty of each chemical and biological indicator and two rolls of tape for each product listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.<br />1) Class 4 Steam Sterilization Indicators <br />2) Class 5 Biological Indicator for steam<br />3) Class 5 Sterilization Integrator Strip (2" to 4" long) for exposure to steam<br />4) Tape Sterilization Indicator Steam 1 in x 60yds (for use with disposable wraps)</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO South and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately 14 MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements<br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below.</p>
<p>1. (Patient Safety - NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence-based practices for preventing Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI)). The Class 4 Chemical Process Indicators (Class 4 indicator strip for steam) must demonstrate an appropriate color change (per manufacturer guidelines) to all monitoring areas on the indicator strip. Chemical Process Indicator strips must demonstrate an appropriate color change to indicate that products have undergone the sterilization process.<br />2. (Patient Safety - NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence-based practices for preventing Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI)). The Chemical Process Indicators (Sterilization Indicator Tape for use with disposable wraps, Steam) must demonstrate an appropriate color change (per manufacturer guidelines) to all monitoring areas on the indicator tape. Chemical Process Indicator tape must be able to indicate sterility parameters have been achieved to demonstrate a successful sterilization process.<br />3. (Patient Safety - NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence-based practices for preventing Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI)) The Chemical Process Indicators (Sterilization Indicator Tape for use with disposable wraps, Steam) must adhere to a wrapped tray and/or package. Chemical Process Indicator tape must adhere to the wrapped item throughout process to protect sterilized item.<br />4. (Patient Safety - NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence-based practices for preventing HAI). Class 5 Steam Integrator indicator must undergo an appropriate color change (per manufacturer guidelines) after undergoing sterilization process. Following exposure to steam penetration, temperature and time (critical parameters for sterility), the integrator strip must reflect appropriate color change (per manufacturer guidelines) to confirm that sterilization parameters have been experienced.<br />5. (Patient Safety - NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence-based practices for preventing HAI). Class 5 biological indicator read-out/must indicate a result of negative growth post sterilization process. The Class 5 biological indicator must read-out/show a result of negative growth post sterilization process, in order to identify that the microorganisms are killed and the sterilization process is effective.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs.<strong> Pricing will be submitted to MMESO South and must be received by 5:00PM CST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong> The selected Vendor of Choice will have an opportunity to provide other items beyond the minimum required product line that you would like to be considered for addition to the Incentive Agreement with a discount from DAPA. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>FAR 52.211-6 -- Brand Name or Equal is incorporated into this solicitation and any subsequent awards.

<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Supbart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br><br>The National Guard Bureau intends to solicit "sole source" conversions and upgrades on equipment for the National Guard Bureau Wulfsberg FLEXCOM Series Radio Communication Systems. <br><br>1) Description: ARNG-AV has fielded the Wulfsberg RT-5000 AM/FM Multi-band Transceiver Radio Communication system on multiple OH-58 Kiowa and UH-60 Blackhawk, CH-47 Chinook and UH-72 Lakota (LUH) Helicopters and Fixed Wing aircraft. This radio communication system takes the place of six normal transceivers covering multiple MHz frequency bands with multiple channels. A second receiver called a "guard" may or may not be part of the system which allows monitoring of an additional frequency. This receiver can be a single channel crystal-controlled or a fully MHz synthesized version. The RT-5000 is controlled by the C-5000 control head via a Wulfsberg proprietary serial tuning bus that reduces wiring complexity and installation. Wulfsberg antennas support the complete range of frequencies of the RT-5000 in one system, and are a subcomponent of the entire system. Wulfsberg is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). <br><br>2) Description of Requirement: ARNG has a requirement for a "sole source" solicitation to Wulfsberg Electronics, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to obtain conversion and upgrade in lieu of a new purchase of 100 Wulsfberg FLEXCOM Communication Radio Systems installed on ARNG aircraft during normal service interval. This capability will include upgrades and technical support to include the latest technology modifications when applicable and will bring the fleet to modernized communication capability at a cost savings against new purchase. The objective is to sustain operational readiness by providing a maintenance repair, system upgrades, and technical support capability to all ARNG units that have within their assigned equipment inventory, Wulfsberg Avionics Radio Communication Systems. <br><br>3) Authority Cited: Requirement for justification of this sole source action is the following: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements [FAR 6.302-1(b)(2)]. Respectively, when the work provided for in the contract is a continuation of the work performed by the specified entity under a preceding contract [FAR 6.302-5(c)(1)(iii)(A)]. Wulsberg Electronics is the owner equipment manufacturer, the sole proprietor, and the only company authorized to repair their own equipment. The only source authorized by Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) to provide service, repair, upgrade for Wulfsberg system on ARNG aircraft. <br><br>4) Point of Contact: Ms. Chelsea Mazzella (contractor), Chelsea.mazzella@us.army.mil, 703-607-2172.<br>5) Place of Performance: CONUS<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The South West Fisheries Science Center in Santa Cruz is a fisheries research facility of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce. It was occupied in December of 2001. It is located at 110 Schaffer Road, Santa Cruz,  California. The Laboratory is approximately 1000 feet from the coastal surf zone, which is considered harsh environment for building structures and their systems.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">SCL receives seawater from the ocean through Long Marine lab. The seawater is stored in the two 30,000 gal storage tanks on the North side of the building. Water is gravity fed from these tanks to a sump where it is then pumped through sand filtration, a UV sterilizer and then distributed to the various aquariums for sustaining fish. Many of these &ldquo;wet&rdquo; studies are long term, delicate and cannot be duplicated should a system failure kill the fish or adversely alter conditions. Part of the lab&rsquo;s work is with ESA listed Coho Salmon.<span style="color: red;"> </span>Survival of these captive fish and success of the research require a constant flow of fresh seawater.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Our existing seawater system utilizes two (2) Fybroc pumps with 20hp motors to distribute seawater to our fish tanks. The pumps operate in a lead/lag arrangement. Water is pumped from a sump, filtered and distributed to the fish tanks. The amount of water needed for the aquarium varies, but falls well below the maximum capacity of the pump. To maintain proper pump curves the return line is manually adjusted to send the unused water back to the sump (where it is re-pumped). Each time an aquarium tank is adjusted the return line must be recalibrated to maintain the proper pressure/pump curve. The existing pumping system is a significant waste of energy. Also, the pump motors are aging and rusting out and need to be replaced before they fail.</span></p>

<DESC><strong>SELECTION FOR CAMPUS PLANNING AND ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING (A-E) DESIGN SERVICES FOR SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION CAMPUS MASTER PLAN PHASE 1 LOCATED AT THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE NATIONAL MALL IN WASHINGTON, DC.</strong>
<p><strong>Solicitation No. F12SOL10015</strong></p>
<p><br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: The proposed procurements listed here are unrestricted. The NAICS code 541310, size standard is $7 million, OFEO Project # 731299616. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian Institution seeks interested design teams to furnish Campus Planning and Architectural-Engineering (A-E) Design Services as required for its Campus Master Plan Phase 1 located at the south side of the National Mall in Washington, DC. This project comprises planning for the area bounded by Jefferson Drive and the National Mall to the north, 7th Street to the east, Independence Avenue to the south and 12th Street to the west. The project area includes buildings and gardens at the heart of the Smithsonian: the Smithsonian Institution Building (known as "the Castle"), the Arts and Industries Building, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Mary Livingston Ripley Garden, the Quadrangle Building including the Enid A. Haupt Garden, the National Museum of African Art, the Sackler Gallery, the Dillon Ripley Center and the Freer Gallery of Art.</p>
<p>The proposed project would commence following agreement on a fixed fee contract for a detailed Scope of Work. The Scope of Work will be issued to the most highly qualified firm selected from among a short list of no more than 5 firms and will address the issues described below. The Smithsonian is engaging a Facilitator to work with the Smithsonian's Senior Leadership in the development of a statement of project goals and program priorities to be incorporated in the Scope of Work that will be issued to the selected firm for the Campus Master Plan Phase 1. The project is expected to take 8-12 months. The selected firm may be considered for additional services to implement the plan and/or to extend the area included in the plan. A budget and implementation sequence for the Campus Master Plan Phase 1 will be a required component of the project deliverables.</p>
<p><strong>Project Goals:</strong>The area south of the National Mall from the Freer Gallery of Art east to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, from Independence Avenue north to Madison Drive is the heart of the Smithsonian, site of the Castle (Smithsonian Institution Building), the first museum, and diverse collections from around the world. For all its history and variety, this site suffers from some notable impediments, and the buildings within the landscape are not utilized in a fully functional and efficient way. The Smithsonian would like to address the following issues:</p>
<p><strong>The Smithsonian's Front Door</strong>: Where and when do visitors enter the Smithsonian? The Castle is an attractive and iconic presence in the middle of the Mall, protruding as it does in its anachronistic way, having claimed its place long before the McMillan Plan. Close up, however, its entrance is a dark, cramped, steep stair to the front door with a shabby and drab Great Hall beyond. Visitor services are poorly designed, with food carts in the hallway and chairs cordoned off with retractable straps on bollards. Restrooms are dilapidated. The space leads to an awkward change of level to the Garden behind, but gives no indication that the entrances to four museums are within steps.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian aspires to greet visitors with the depth and breadth of the Smithsonian, a way to organize their visit, and offer rest and refreshment without creating the feeling that one is occupying a corridor. The Castle can be a literal and figurative gateway to the Smithsonian, a place of information and engagement, while inviting visitors to understand the reach of the Smithsonian around the world and into outer space, and leading visitors back out to the physical experience of the rest of the Mall.</p>
<p><strong>Universal Access:</strong>The ground plane that supports the Castle, Arts and Industries Building, the Freer Gallery, the Sackler Gallery, the National Museum of African Art and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden is discontinuous, on multiple levels, paved in multiple materials and impedes movement between buildings in an east-west direction. From the south fa&ccedil;ade of the Castle it is nearly impossible to locate the entrances to the Sackler Gallery and the National Museum of African Art, and mysterious as to whether the Arts and Industries Building can be entered at all. The Hirshhorn is walled off, even from its own sculpture garden, and the Freer Gallery is cut off from the Enid A. Haupt Garden by its own loading dock. The Smithsonian encourages the perception of this site as a precinct of connected buildings, landscapes and experiences, with no limitations to access between indoors and outdoors, from building to building.</p>
<p><strong>Reimagining the Castle:</strong>The charming Gothic exterior of the Castle has an air of permanence and history, but the building's interior is much changed over its century and a half existence, having functioned as residence, research lab, largest Smithsonian auditorium ever, collections storage, office building, and visitor center. What is the best use for a Castle in the 21st century? In recognition of its symbolic importance and irresistible draw, the Castle should become the best version of what we imagine it to be: the informative and exciting heart of the Smithsonian and first stop for knowing it better. To further its best use, offices could be relocated from the Castle (and from the Quadrangle Building, the Sackler, and African Art) to a consolidated, efficient nearby office building that would provide a more collegial and sustainable environment.</p>
<p><strong>Rebirth of the A+I Building (AIB):</strong>In 2012, the Arts and Industries Building will have been shuttered for seven years, but the project to rehabilitate the Shell (replace roof, windows and selected wrought iron trusses) will be completed in spring 2013, and the landmark could be ready for limited interim use a year or so later. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to designate the structure as the home of a new national Latino museum, a proposal that assumes some adjacent underground construction. The Castle Precinct Plan should incorporate the assumption of near and long-term use of AIB and embrace this first museum of the Smithsonian as a site of lively activity. Planning for Interim Use of the AIB and for the proposed Latino Museum would be addressed in other studies.</p>
<p><strong>A Place for Education:</strong>The Quadrangle Building (the Quad) is difficult to find, difficult to navigate, full of windowless offices and, through poor design, obscures the fact that it is connective tissue to its neighbors. The unexcavated area between the Quad and AIB has been examined as a site for mechanical equipment, locker rooms and a loading dock connection, but a public connection to A+I and beyond has not been explored. As part of the strategic priority of revitalizing education, the Smithsonian needs spaces that support that mission, including auditoriam, classrooms suited to web-based technologies, broadcast facilities and adjacent galleries that may be appropriately carved out of underground space.</p>
<p>Services include, but are not limited to, site and building investigations, facilities programming, campus planning, architectural and engineering design concepts, cost analyses, implementation planning and the development of presentations for internal stakeholder groups and external agencies. Initial informational briefings of the National Capital Planning Commission, the US Commission of Fine Arts and the District of Columbia Historic Preservation Officer will be included in the scope. Section 106 and NEPA compliance services would not be included in the initial scope of services but could be optional additional services.</p>
<p><strong>Selection Criteria:</strong> Evaluation and selection of firms shall be in accordance with FAR 36.6. Firms should submit qualifications using SF330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications and Project Report Example(s) as follows. Submit 1-3 separately bound examples of planning reports completed for other institutions and organizations. For each planning report submitted, include in Section H of SF330, the title of the report and a list of key personnel of the prime firm and any subcontractors and their roles on that planning project. The firm is responsible for obtaining permission from the client organization to share the report(s) and may omit or obscure cost or other sensitive information.</p>
<p>Selection will be based on the below criterion, which are listed in descending order of importance. Evaluation of firms' qualifications in determining the short list to be interviewed will include the submitted SF330 and Project Report Example(s).

The evaluation will consider both the firm's working history with its major sub consultants as well as the firm's proposal of sub consultants it has not previously worked with but whose inclusion on the proposed team would best address the requirements of this project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <strong>Proposed Key Personnel Qualifications: </strong>Firms' staff will be evaluated based on the education, training, registration, quantity and quality of relevant experience as evidenced in the SF330 and in project report examples both at that firm and with other firms and with respect to the proposed key disciplines for planning and design principals and staff, and technical discipline leaders.

<p>FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (Addendum)</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />A firm-fixed price contract will be awarded to the company determined to represent the overall best value to the USCG. In accordance with FAR 15, the Government will determine the best value using the tradeoff process. The tradeoff process will lead to an award decision that is made between the following price and non-priced evaluation factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Approach<br />Factor 2: Relevant Past Performance<br />Factor 3: Price</p>
<p>The evaluation factors listed above are in descending order of importance. Technical approach and past performance are more important than price. When combined, technical approach and past performance are significantly more important than price. However, as the technical approach and past performance factors converge, the price may become more important.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award with or without conducting discussions.</p>
<p>For each factor, offerors are required to provide the information described below:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Approach: The Government will evaluate each Offeror's technical proposal to determine their capacity to perform all the requirements outlined in the PWS, which will include an evaluation of the following:</p>
<p>(1) The courses being offered and how they align to the Government's specific training requirements established in PWS 5.1.</p>
<p>(2) A description as to how the Offeror will meet the hands-on training requirement established in PWS 5.1.</p>
<p>(3) The experience of the proposed instructors in accordance with PWS 1.3.2.</p>
<p>(4) The contractor's facility in accordance with PWS 4.1.</p>
<p>Factor 2- Relevant Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the past performance of the offeror for relevancy. The offeror shall provide past performance information for services directly related and relevant to the services to be performed under the PWS. To be considered relevant, the services must have been performed within the past three years. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information other than the information submitted with the proposals received in conducting the evaluation. A Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will receive a neutral rating. The USCG reserves the right to also consider other ways to evaluate past performance.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price: The Government will evaluate the total overall price to determine price reasonableness by using competition or by using other methods.<br /><br />(End of provision addendum)<br /><br />SECTION II<br />ADDITIONAL CONTRACT CLAUSES AND PROVISIONS</p>

<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:</p>
<p>Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.</p>

<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.<br />(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or</p>
<p>(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>

<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman<br />Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman<br />Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.</p>
<p>If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

(e) In addition to the requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall meet the requirements of the appropriate payment clauses in this contract when submitting payment requests. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is N40442-12-T-7479, and it is being issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-57, effective March 15, 2012.</p>
<p>NAICS code 333618 applies.</p>
<p>Military Sealift Command (MSC), Norfolk, VA intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order to an authorized service provider for the MAN 48/60 design engines in support of the USNS CARL BRASHEAR for the following services:</p>
<p>MDG4 Preprocessing Alarm Failure</p>
<p>1.0 ABSTRACT<br />This item describes the need for a Technical Representative to assist ship's force with the failure of MDG4 Preprocessing Alarm.<br />2.0 REFERENCES: None<br />3.0 ITEM LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION<br />3.1 Location: USNS Carl Brashear (T-AKE 7)<br />Dubai (subject to change)<br />3.2 Description<br />3.2.1 MDG4 Preprocessing Alarm<br />4.0 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT/MATERIALS/SERVICES: None<br />5.0 NOTES<br />5.1 Send all access requests to the Port Engineer Contact in Para 5.4<br />5.2 Performance period shall be from 07 July to 17 July 2012.<br />5.3 Performance location is Dubai, location is subject to change. <br />5.4 This ship contains High Voltage (HV) electrical systems. The Contractor and Subcontractors shall obey all posted and verbal instructions regarding safety and exclusion from High Voltage areas. At no time shall a Contractor or Subcontractor approach, work on, or enter a High Voltage area with out proper authorization.&nbsp; Preprocessing Alarm is part of the control system of the engine which requires&nbsp;OEM programs and equipment to access engine's software and diagnose/fix.<br />5.5 THE USNS CARL BRASHEAR ELECTRICAL COLOR CODING DOES NOT FOLLOW CONSISTENT COLOR SCHEME. THE SHIP IS KNOWN TO HAVE CURRENT CARRYING CONDUCTORS COLORED GREEN, BLUE, BLACK AND WHITE. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL ASSUME ALL ELECTRICAL CABLES ARE HOT UNTIL TESTED OTHERWISE. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL TEST ALL ELECTRICAL CABLES TO ENSURE THEY ARE DEAD PRIOR TO WORKING ON THE ITEM.<br />6.0 QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS: None<br />7.0 STATEMENT OF WORK:<br />7.1 Technical Representative shall assist ship's force with the below mentioned Preprocessing Alarm Failure.<br />7.1.1 MDG4 Preprocessing Alarm is active. The MT-91 does not display any codes, but only "SYSTEM FAILURE". MDG4 is operable with no observed deviations from normal conditions. Ship's force disconnected a sensor to cause a pre-processing error. The MT-91 displayed the correct code for the induced fault. Early troubleshooting revealed the strong possibility of a bad internal relay within the pre-processing PLC, and ABB 07KT94. Upon receipt of a replacement PLC, ship's force followed the FME Service Information Letter Volume E Issue 15 (dated 20Jul2012) to reload both the firmware (via SMC with FME p/n M12701702) and the pre-processing program for the 8L, 3.3V (FME p/n M12701502). Brief emails with FME representative Gregg Bellows confirmed we performed the procedure properly, however symptoms still persist.<br />7.2 All work shall be performed to the satisfaction of the Chief Engineer.<br />7.3 At the completion of all work an electronic Service Report shall be provide to both the Chief Engineer and Port Engineer. <br />8.0 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: None Additional</p>
<p>The following FAR and DFAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference:</p>

<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number <br />Delivery Order <br />Cage Code/Ext <br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date <br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the April 2012 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-58. This acquisition is a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541690. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. This is a labor hour contract.
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM), Specialized Information Services (SIS) has a requirement to create new content, enhance existing content, and procure support for content building activities for the Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management (CHEMM) Website. The award will be for a Base Year with options for two (2) successive one-year periods. The CHEMM tool is designed to provide access to comprehensive sets of information via a user-friendly interface. The users include first responders, first receivers, other health care providers, and planners. CHEMM allows these users to plan, respond, recover, and mitigate the effects of incidents involving chemicals. CHEMM's unique content covers information especially relevant to chemical exposure-related mass casualty and "unusual" scenarios. CHEMM's expert interface will link users to resources from other organizations, e.g., U.S. EPA/NOAA (CAMEO tools), the CDC's Emergency Preparedness and Response Web site and NIOSH Emergency Response Safety and Health Database (ERSH-DB), the chemical industry's CHEMTREC service, poison control centers, etc. Like NIH's WISER (Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders) and REMM (Radiation Emergency Medical Management), CHEMM is available on the Internet for online use on computers and handheld devices, and also for download so that it can be used in an emergency even without an Internet connection. A Smartphone app for CHEMM is also under development.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE OF THE PROCUREMENT<br />The contractor shall work with CHEMM subject matter experts and the NLM COTR to perform tasks associated with data extraction from source reference materials approved by NLM to enhance and update topical pages for the CHEMM Website. In addition, the contractor shall conduct quality control (technical accuracy of CHEMM information extracted/summarized from other sources) and editing checks on the content of the<br />CHEMM Website.</p>
<p>The contractor shall also select references and Web links to Internet resources for use in CHEMM based on NLM-provided selection criteria and provide comments on possible enhancement of the selection criteria.</p>
<p>Task 1. Create new content for CHEMM in easy Web-readable style, by extracting/summarizing data from NLM approved reference materials. The content should be written for easily readable style for the Web.</p>

<p>508 COMPLIANCE<br />THE&nbsp;SECTION ON&nbsp;508 COMPLIANCE&nbsp;PERTAINS ONLY TO THE MONTHLY&nbsp;REPORTING REQUIREMENTS&nbsp;IN THE STATEMENT OF WORK.<br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires agencies' electronic and information technology be accessible to people with disabilities. The CHEMM data must be Section 508 compliant. Specifically, the end product must be conformant with all applicable provisions, including:<br /><br />1194.41 Information, documentation, and support<br />(Only complete this portion of the attached GPAT.)</p>
<p>These provisions can be found at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm<br /><br />Section 508 Program Need<br />Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are determined to be relevant for the following program need: content for CHEMM website.<br /><br />Technical standards from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart B have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those technical provisions identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).<br /><br />Functional performance criteria from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart C have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those functional performance criteria identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).<br /><br />Section 508 Evaluation Factors<br />Responses to the solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. a completed GPAT, VPAT or equivalent and supporting documentation) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.<br /><br />Section 508 Acceptance Criteria<br />The web site design project deliverables as a result of this solicitation will be accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility. The proposals for the CHEMM project must include a GPAT, a sample of which is included as a part of the solicitation.<br />All resulting electronic files and reports delivered by the contractor will become the property of the Government.<br />The electronic files and reports delivered by the contractor will be reviewed and approved for acceptance by the Project Officer upon delivery by the contractor.<br /><br />EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />After satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility, the evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the perspective vendors to meet the needs of the project as set forth in the Statement of Work. Prospective vendors must submit information sufficient to allow NLM to evaluate based on the stated criteria. <br /><br />Content and technical factors are of paramount consideration; however, cost is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost, when combined, are significantly more important than cost. The Government can make tradeoffs among cost and technical factors in determining which Offeror(s) provide the best value by awarding to other than the lowest cost Offeror(s) or other than the highest technically rated Offeror(s). Offeror(s) are advised that award will be made to that Offeror(s) whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Agency's best value determination includes assessments by reviewers with a thorough knowledge of the CHEMM program to evaluate each quote&nbsp;based on the response to the evaluation criteria.&nbsp; <br /><br />Quoters are advised that each quotation may be subjected to a price analysis, as determined to be appropriate by the Government.</p>
<p>In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes:<br /><br />Criterion A: Understanding the Requirements and Technical Approach (40 points)<br />The contractor shall provide a written proposal demonstrating an understanding of the purpose and intent of the task order requirements through a comprehensive description of the proposed approach; and describe procedures to ensure that the project timeline will be met. The proposal demonstrates sufficient contractor experience and knowledge to assure rapid execution of tasks. All proposed staff shall be approved by the SIS Project Officer to ensure that skills and experience are sufficient for the requirements of specific, assigned tasks.</p>
<p>Criterion B: Corporate Experience and Personnel (35 points)<br />This criterion will be evaluated based on the description of the organization, personnel and project experience. The proposal should include a detailed description of the organization. The experience of the personnel should be outlined. Detailed information describing the facilities and resources the organization has to carry out the tasks of the project should also be included. Proposals must provide an explanation of how the corporation will allocate overall resources to this project, and an identification of a clear line of responsibility for the project. Corporate experience will be evaluated based upon the offeror's prior experience with similar activities. Proposed personnel shall be evaluated on their demonstrated, documented and relevant expertise, education availability and experience.</p>
<p>Criterion C: Past Performance (25 points)<br />The government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of high quality products and services.</p>
<p>a) Offerors shall submit a list and description of the last five relevant contracts that are similar to this type of requirement (i.e. IT effort) completed during the past three years and all contracts currently in process. Offerors shall be evaluated on (1) record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; (2) adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; (3) reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and deep commitment satisfaction; and (4) business-like concern for the interests of the customer.<br /><br />b) For each contract/subcontract identified, include a brief synopsis which includes the date the work was performed, the client for whom the work was performed (include client name and telephone number), and a description of work performed. The vendor is authorized to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contract/subcontract and the vendor's corrective actions, if necessary.<br /><br />PROPOSAL SUBMISSION<br />The proposal should not be more than 10 pages. The page count does not include the cover letter, table of contents, executive summary or appendix. The past performance documentation will also not account against the page count.</p>
<p>Please email an electronic copy of your proposal to pringlek@mail.nih.gov. The subject line should read CHEMM Proposal and may include the solicitation number. The electronic copy should be received by 12 noon local prevailing time on Monday, June 25, 2012. Also, send one original and 3 copies of the proposal for evaluation.

<p>1. Background<br />The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pacific Islands Regional Office (PIRO), Protected Resources Division (PRD) is dedicated to protecting and recovering endangered and threatened species of sea turtles, monk seals and cetaceans as mandated by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). Through management, conservation and recovery efforts, and public outreach and education, PRD strives to ensure the recovery and survival of the protected marine species of the Pacific Islands Region for future generations.</p>
<p>Currently, recovery of the endangered Hawaiian monk seal is a high priority for NMFS. The future of Hawaiian monk seals appears dire at present, with a current population of less than 1,200 that is declining at a rate of about 4% per year. Low survival of juvenile seals is the principal cause for population decline in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where threats include food limitation, entanglement in marine debris, and shark predation on seal pups. In the main Hawaiian Islands, juvenile survival is currently not a concern, yet seals face other threats related to human disturbance, potential infectious disease outbreaks, fishery impacts, and recently, apparent intentional deaths caused by humans.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges to Hawaiian monk seal recovery mentioned above, a growing number of Native Hawaiians leaders, cultural practitioners and local community members have begun to support conservation of Hawaiian monk seals as an indigenous Hawaiian species. NMFS' work to date with some of these community members has included participating in meetings and consultations with practitioners and community leaders on various islands to discuss community concerns and questions regarding NMFS monk seal recovery activities, and supporting community leaders from neighbor islands to travel to Oahu to participate in meetings and outreach activities related to monk seal recovery. Through the project described in this statement of work, PRD seeks to continue this productive collaboration with Native Hawaiian organizations (NHO's), practitioners, and community leaders regarding Hawaiian monk seal recovery actions.<br />NMFS is developing a Hawaiian Monk Seal Recovery Actions Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (DPEIS) that details several newly-developed and proposed recovery actions that may have the potential to affect historic properties or sites of religious or cultural significance in the Hawaiian archipelago. These properties or sites may include fish ponds and associated structures, fishing shrines, and fishing ko&lsquo;as, among others. In addition to potential impacts to properties or sites, other cultural resources and traditional practices may also be affected by the actions proposed in the PEIS. This project is focused on identifying Native Hawaiians' concerns regarding potential impacts of NMFS' Hawaiian monk seal recovery actions on historic properties of religious and cultural significance to Native Hawaiians, as well as on their cultural resources and traditional practices.<br />The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to assess the effects of their actions on the human environment. This assessment must consider whether the proposed actions may significantly affect historic and cultural resources. The Code of Federal Regulations in 40 CFR 1508.8(b) describes what is to be included when assessing the effects of federal actions: "Effects includes ecological (such as the effects on natural resources and on the components, structures, and functioning of affected ecosystems), aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health, whether direct, indirect, or cumulative." Furthermore, the regulations state that "Significantly as used in NEPA requires considerations of both context and intensity" (40 CFR 1508.27), and that the following factors (among others) should be considered in evaluating intensity:<br />&bull; Unique characteristics of the geographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural resources, park lands, prime farmlands, wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or ecologically critical areas (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(3)). <br />&bull; The degree to which the action may adversely affect districts, sites, highways, structures, or objects listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or may cause loss or destruction of significant scientific, cultural, or historical resources (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(8)).<br />Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 U.S.C. Section 470f) requires federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties, specifically properties that are listed and/or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Furthermore, Section 101(d)(6)(B) of the Act requires that federal agencies must consult with any NHO that attaches religious and cultural significance to historic properties that may be affected by the agency's undertakings. The project associated with this statement of work will assist NMFS in meeting NMFS' obligations under Section 106 of the NHPA by consulting with Native Hawaiians and other relevant parties (e.g., non-Hawaiian fishpond owners) to ensure the impacts of Hawaiian monk seal recovery actions on historic properties, cultural resources, and traditional practices are thoroughly identified, understood, assessed, and mitigated to the fullest extent possible.<br />2. Scope and Objectives<br />The work requires an individual or organization with proven talent, expertise, and capability to provide a thorough assessment of the impacts of implementing recovery actions detailed in the Hawaiian Monk Seal Recovery Actions PEIS on Native Hawaiian cultural resources, historic properties, and traditional practices. The work also requires an individual or organization with proven expertise in the NHPA Section 106 compliance process, capable of working directly with NMFS, NHO's, the State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD), the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and other appropriate parties to identify historic properties that meet the criteria for placement on the National Register of Historic Places.<br />The objectives of this project are:<br />&bull; Assist NMFS in complying with NHPA Section 106, including the consultation requirements with NHO's and other eligible parties (e.g., Non-Hawaiian fishpond owners) by:<br />o Identifying and contacting those organizations and parties.<br />o Working with the NHO's and other parties to identify historic properties of religious and cultural significance that may be affected by the actions detailed in the PEIS, determine whether these properties are eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.<br />o Identify any potential adverse effects that may occur to these identified historic properties.<br />o Develop acceptable measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate the identified potential adverse effects.<br />o Develop a Section 106 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Programmatic Agreement (PA) outlining how potential adverse effects will be addressed.<br />o Coordinate communication and consultation with the Hawaii SHPD and the ACHP at appropriate junctures in the compliance process.<br />&bull; Revise the current Cultural Impact Assessment (CIA) in the PEIS by thoroughly assessing and describing in detail the impacts of the proposed actions described in the PEIS on Native Hawaiian cultural resources, historic properties, and traditional practices in accordance with NEPA.<br />To achieve these objectives, PRD requires a Contractor who is widely recognized as having expertise in Native Hawaiian cultural resources and traditional practices, and who can effectively facilitate communications among and between Native Hawaiian organizations and individuals, other engaged parties, and NMFS staff. The scope of work includes clearly understanding, accurately documenting, and effectively communicating concerns and priorities of NMFS and Native Hawaiians regarding endangered Hawaiian monk seal recovery; planning, facilitating, and documenting meetings and individual consultations to identify historic properties of religious and cultural significance, cultural resources, and traditional practices that may be affected by Hawaiian monk seal recovery actions; and working with Native Hawaiians to identify measures that may avoid, minimize, or mitigate these potential impacts. The results and products delivered via this contract will be used by NMFS to assess and mitigate the impacts of Hawaiian monk seal recovery actions on Native Hawaiian cultural resources, historic properties, and traditional practices; and to meet the agency's obligations under NHPA section 106 and NEPA.<br />Regarding the scope and scale of this project, the recovery actions presented in the PEIS are programmatic in nature, meaning, in part, that the exact times and locations at which some of the actions will be implemented will vary depending on conditions in the field that may change over time.<br />The approach adopted by the Contractor in implementing this project will need to reflect the programmatic nature of the proposed actions in the PEIS discussed above. The Contractor shall be expected to develop and implement an approach and process that represents a reasonable and good faith effort, while doing so in a timely manner and at a cost and level of effort that is proportional to the overall cost and level of effort of implementing the actions presented in the PEIS.<br />3. Tasks<br />The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:<br />Task 1. Prepare and submit a project implementation plan<br />The Contractor shall prepare and submit for NMFS review and acceptance a written project implementation plan describing the overall approach and specific steps the Contractor shall take to successfully complete the project, including completion of Tasks 2 - 5 below. The plan will describe the approach to be adopted by the Contractor in identifying and mitigating potential adverse effects as discussed above in Section 2. The plan will include, sections describing the overall project approach, objectives, milestones, timeline(s), and draft outlines for the revised PEIS cultural impact assessment section (Task 3) and the NHPA Section 196 compliance report (Task 4). The plan will be subject to PRD review and approval prior to plan implementation by the Contractor.<br />Task 2. Conduct consultations with NHO's and Hawaiian individuals, other eligible parties, and NMFS staff.<br />Per the project implementation plan prepared and submitted in Task 1., the Contractor shall plan, convene, and facilitate meetings among Native Hawaiians and other eligible parties (e.g., non-Hawaiian fishpond owners) and between these parties and NMFS staff engaged in planning Hawaiian monk seal recovery actions. Meeting participants shall include NHO's, community leaders, and cultural practitioners, identified by the Contractor and reviewed by PRD, who have extensive experience with, knowledge of, and/or strong cultural ties to Hawai&lsquo;i's cultural resources, traditional and/or religious practices, and/or marine resources.<br />The Contractor shall hold at least one meeting during the performance period between the consulting parties and NMFS PRD staff on each of the islands of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii. The objectives of these meetings are to 1) identify historic properties, cultural resources, and religious and/or traditional practices that may be affected by the actions proposed in the PEIS; 2) identify potential adverse effects that may occur to these properties, resources, and/or practices; and 3) develop acceptable mitigation measures to avoid, offset, or minimize the potential adverse effects to the identified properties, resources, and/or practices.<br />The Contractor shall also:<br />&bull; Prepare and submit for PRD review and acceptance written plans and discussion topics for each meeting at least one week prior to each meeting;<br />&bull; Provide for PRD review and acceptance written reports within four weeks after each meeting summarizing the results of the meetings, including information pertinent to Tasks 3 and 4 below; and,<br />&bull; Disburse and administer expenditures associated with the meetings, including all expenditures associated with pre and post meeting communications, meeting venues and supplies, cultural protocols, and travel for participants who are not NMFS staff or contractors.<br />Task 3. Revise the current Draft PEIS Cultural Impact Assessment by identifying, assessing, and describing in detail the impacts of the proposed recovery actions on cultural resources, religious and/or traditional practices, and historic properties.<br />As a result, in part, of conducting Task 1 and 2 above, the Contractor shall identify and describe in detail the cultural resources, religious and traditional practices, and historic properties that may be affected by the proposed recovery actions described in the Draft PEIS (Section 3.4.6, Section 3.4.7, and Section 4.9.4 of the Draft PEIS). This information will provide the foundation for assessing and describing in detail the impacts of the recovery actions on the identified resources, practices, and properties, and draft a revised version of the Draft PEIS CIA (Section 3.4.6, Section 3.4.7, and Section 4.9.4 of the Draft PEIS). The Contractor shall provide the draft version of the revised CIA to NMFS staff for their review and comment, and shall afterward incorporate those revisions and comments into a final CIA to be included in the Final PEIS.<br />Task 4.

<p>(End of Addendum)</p>
<p><br />(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is used.</p>
<p>The following is added to paragraph (a) of the provision:</p>
<p>(1) Factor 1, Technical. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, and technical requirements. All offerors who submit the documentation required in FAR 52.212-1 Addendum, Instructions to Offerors, will be considered technically acceptable. All such offerors will be treated equally except for price and past performance records.</p>
<p>(2) Factor 2, Price. For award purposes, the offeror will be evaluated on the TOTAL PRICE of all CLINS as contained in the schedule. Apparent calculation errors found in an offer may be corrected by the Government. Only US Dollar or Euro currency offers will be accepted in accordance with (IAW) provision 5352.225-9004, Submission of Offers in Other Than United States Currency. All offers that are received in Euro currency will be converted to US Dollars by using the established Foreign Currency Fluctuation Defense (FCFD) budget rate, which is currently 0.7491 Euro per US Dollar.</p>
<p>(3) Factor 3, Past Performance. The purpose of past performance evaluation is to assess the offeror's ability to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past work records. Past performance will be evaluated for recency, relevancy, and quality of services rendered. Evaluation of past performance will be a critical assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. The Government reserves the right to use past performance information obtained from other sources (questionnaires, CPARS data, customers known to the Government, consumer protection organizations, and any other sources) that may have useful and/or relevant information. One of the following ratings will be assigned to the past performance factor when an offeror's past performance has been evaluated:</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUTION RATINGS<br />RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Acceptable Based on the offeror's past performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's past performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past performance. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports an unacceptable rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>(4) Award Process: The Government will make an award to the lowest price offeror with an Acceptable past performance rating. The Government will first evaluate all submissions for technical acceptability. The Government will then evaluate all submissions for price. The lowest price offer will then be evaluated for past performance. If the lowest priced offeror's past performance is determined to be "Acceptable", the evaluation process will stop and award will be made to that offeror. If the lowest priced offeror's past performance is determined to be "Unacceptable", the Government will evaluate the past performance of the next lowest offeror. This process will continue, as needed, until an offeror is rated "Acceptable" for past performance. This offeror will receive the award. The Government intends to make one award to the offeror meeting the above criteria without discussions, but reserves the right to open discussions at any time in the evaluation process. <br />(End of provision)<br /><br />(x) Include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Alt I, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with your offer or complete paragraph (b)(2) of 52.212-3 Alt 1, if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov .

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />ON <br />CLOUD COMPUTING
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 Headquarters Air Force Recruiting Service (HQAFRS) is seeking information on the applicability and viability of using cloud computing to host the Air Force Recruiting Information Support System- Total Force (AFRISS-TF).</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the respondent's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>2.1 AFRS is developing a consolidated, automated recruiting information system that encompasses all three Air Force Components (Active Duty, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve). AFRISS-TF will merge two current legacy systems, and contain information subject to Privacy Act restrictions and "For Official Use Only" information. Due to the sensitivity of the information contained on AFRISS-TF, the hosting solution must meet DIACAP and FISMA standards.</p>
<p>2.1.1 AFRS is considering hosting this system on the cloud using a platform as-a-service (PaaS) solution. Specifically, AFRS would like to consider utilizing PaaS to provide integrated applications, operating systems, storage, database, and development environments tailored to specific recruiting requirements, and requirements of the AFRISS-TF program. The PaaS solution should be easily managed by administrators working within an "af.mil" domain, scalable, and elastic to provide AFRS with a clearly defined level of service. Finally, the PaaS solution should incorporate a pay-as-you-use pricing model.</p>
<p>3.0 Information Requested</p>
<p>3.1 Please provide a response to the following questions regarding specific cloud computing solutions and providers (not all-inclusive, please address these questions in addition to any other information you feel is pertinent to our request):</p>
<p>3.1.1 Provide comments and/or questions on the attached draft Statement of Need.<br />3.1.2 Identify whether your hosting solution meets FISMA standards in accordance with DoDI 8510-01. If so, please explain how you ascertained that it does. <br />3.1.3 If you have obtained a DIACAP and/or NIST ATO, identify the IA controls that applied, any deviations to those controls and the POA&amp;M to resolve those deviations.<br />3.1.4 If you are in the process of obtaining a DIACAP and/or NIST hosting solution ATO, provide the MAC level, sensitivity level, and projected completion date.<br />3.1.5 Do you currently have or did you previously have a contract with any branch of the United States government for cloud hosting? If so, please include contract numbers and provide the SLA's for review. <br />3.1.6 Because the cloud will be used to host sensitive data that cannot be accessed by anyone outside of authorized Air Force personnel, please provide an explanantion of how your organization will protect this data.<br />3.1.7 Provide your pricing/billing structure for Platform as a Service. Is the pricing/billing structure the same for Infrastructure as a Service? Is the structure negotiable?<br />3.1.8 How does your pricing/billing structure provide flexibility based on varying usage?<br />3.1.9 How do you price/bill for bandwidth?<br />3.1.10 Do you provide pricing bundles? If so, what is included in the bundles?<br />3.1.11 Identify how much time is needed to provide a proposal for a hosting solution.<br />3.1.12 Identify how soon after award of a contract you would begin work on setting up the hosting solution. How long until it would be complete? (Based on the attached SON)<br />3.1.13 As defined by the NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture, "A cloud provider is a person, an organization; it is the entity responsible for making a service available to interested parties. A Cloud Provider acquires and manages the computing infrastructure required for providing the services, runs the cloud software that provides the services, and makes arrangement to deliver the cloud services to the Cloud Consumers through network access." <br />A cloud broker is defined as "An entity that manages the use, performance and delivery of cloud services, and negotiates relationships between Cloud Providers and Cloud Consumers." <br />Of these two defined entities, which one more accurately defines the capability of your service?<br />3.1.14 If you are a cloud broker, then please identify your cloud partner(s)/provider(s)?<br />3.1.15 Do your employees currently have, at a minimum, a NACLC background investigation?<br />3.1.16 Are any of the requirements included in the Draft SON unreasonable and/or unattainable? Please explain why.<br />3.1.17 Large businesses would be required to provide a small business subcontracting plan indicating what percentage of the contract they would subcontract out to small businesses to include service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small businesses, and historically underutilized business zones (HUB Zone). Subcontractors include any company that is contracted with for services or supplies that would support this contract. If you are a large business under NAICS 518210, indicate what percentage of the work would be subcontracted to the aforementioned categories. If not, please provide a brief explanation of why subcontracting to small businesses is not appropriate. NOTE: Small businesses may be located through the Dynamic Small Business Search at https://ccr.gov.</p>

<p>A: The Stock List Price (SLP) is an internal figure to the Government. In an effort to ensure that vendors are providing offers which are based more on the actual work than on a percentage of the SLP, we no longer provide the SLP. Additionally, the SLP is subject to change at any time without notice. Often, for the SLP to come into the picture, it means that an item requires a substantial amount of work and is near or at the point of being out of scope of the contract. At this point, an over and above request should be submitted and then a determination will be made as to whether the contractor should proceed with the work or to determine the item to be Beyond Economical Repair (BER).</p>

<DESC>Questions & Answers<br>22 June 2012<br><br><br>Q1.  Could you expand on the status of the Bridge contract?  Will it happen, and for what duration?  <br><br>Answer:  Yes, the bridge will happen, probably for about 5 months, to ensure uninterrupted service during mobilization.<br><br>Q2.  Could you expand on when the Solicitation will be out?  Will it be May, June, or July?  And what will be the response time?<br><br>Answer:  The solicitation is in the review process.  As soon as we receive approval for release, we will issue it for 30 days.<br><br>Q3.  Is the Government willing to share if they are contemplating a single award or multiple award IDIQ. Further, would the Government welcome input from industry regarding existing IDIQ vehicles from which this work might be competed to a manageable number of known and pre-qualified prime contractors, rather than as a full and open competition that might present a source solicitation challenge?<br><br>Answer:  The government is contemplating a single award IDIQ.  The government's acquisition strategy is to award a contract on full and open competition.<br><br>Q4.  ... and opt to make this requirement a SDVOSB Set-aside per FAR 19.1405.<br><br>Answer:  Since the performance of services will be OCONUS the cited FAR section is not applicable.  <br><br>Q5.  Synopsis poster on February 1, 2012...it states "the Government may need to issue a bridge contract to ensure uninterrupted service during the transition/mobilization period (i.e., DOCPER process)." Does this mean that there is currently an incumbent and this is a re-compete of that contract, or is the non-personal Intelligence Technical Support Services throughout the USAREUR area of responsibility a new solicitation.<br><br>Answer:  There is currently an incumbent; this is a re-compete.<br>

<DESC>The purpose of this vegetative treatment project is to enhance habitat conditions for wildlife in the southern Big Horn Mountain Range. The emphasis of this project is to maintain and enhance stands of curl-leaf mountain mahogany, a crucial forage source for wintering ungulates.  Treatments would primarily target the removal of limber pine stands; however, other conifer species would  also be treated.
The treatment area is located in the southern Big Horn Mountains (T40N/R85W Section 4).  The area is accessible from the town of Arminto via the Natrona County 105 (Buffalo Creek Road) to County Road 110 (33 Mile Road).  Please refer to the attached map of the Lost Creek Project Area and 2012 treatment area.

<p>BACKGROUND:<br /><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic"><br />In 2012, to increase examiner production hours, OCC determined that it needed to reduce the effort by examiners to assess and score the written communications skills test (WCST) and ensure that any candidate that does not pass the written test, or any of the up-front assessment tools, do not move further in the assessment process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To do so, it was determined that using "computer technology" to automate the scoring the WCST would ensure unbiased consistent results and not require the use of examiners for assessments - in effect obtaining better results using fewer key resources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The WCST will be administered separately by OCC's testing administrator at their sites and is preceded by OCC's knowledge test.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two campaigns may be run each year and OCC estimates that upward of 2,000 assessments may be required for each campaign.</span></p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK:</p>
<p>The OCC is seeking an experience and qualified vendor (s) to&nbsp;automate the assessment scoring of the existing WCST and implement and test the automated assessment scoring technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><strong>&nbsp; <br /><br /></strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:<br /><br />The OCC plans to issue a solicitation and subsequent award with a base year and four one-year option periods.</span></p>

Bidders who have registered with FBO must access the data for this solicitation by way of the link issued with the solicitation. Additionally, to view and/or download Export Controlled Materials, a company must be certified (via an approved DD Form 2345) by the Joint Certification Program (JCP) administered by the Defense Logistic Information Service (DLIS). This certification establishes that a company is a U.S. or Canadian contractor eligible to receive unclassified technical data that is under the control of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) or the Canadian Department of National Defense (DND). Questions about this program or DD Form 2345 should be addressed to U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS), Federal Center, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084; or telephone (616) 961-4358, toll free (800) 352-3572; or email <br />jcp-admin@dlis.dla.mil.

After entering the MPIN, the export controlled package/document should be viewable/downloadable by Vendors that have gone through the JCP process. If a Vendor still has problems, the Vendor should check to make sure that their CCR registration and MPIN are valid and up-to-date. If problems still persist, the Vendor may call the FBO help desk at 866-606-8220, selection option 2 for FBO issues, and ask for troubleshooting assistance. Bidders cannot log into the FBO home page and search data. This solicitation is a competitive bid and there will be a formal public bid opening. DISCLAIMER: The official plans and specifications are located on the official government webpage and the Government is not liable for information furnished by any other source. Amendments, if/when issued will be posted to https://www.fbo.gov/ for electronic downloading. This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments prior to closing; therefore, it is the bidders responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to the solicitation.

This action is under the authority 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, as it is impracticable to seek competition for the estimated two months period while negotiations under NIHOD2012307 are on-going. Based on the complexity and level of detail involved in dealing with these cases, it is not feasible for new contractors to assume responsibility for the trademark case load for such a brief period of time and meet the deadlines necessary for filing with the UPTO and foreign entities. </span></p>

Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Currently hospital staff is performing the work. This procurement will be required 5 days a week with the exception of federal holidays. The weekend hours may vary depending on the needs of the hospital service. I anticipate this to be a multi-year contract but it must be approved. This is why I'm gathering information from potential sources to present to CAVHS to implement a base+4 contract.

Acquiring these centrifuges will assist in the United States' ability to have a domestically-owned enrichment capability to provide a source of fuel for the Nation's nuclear power reactors and to serve the national security needs of the United States.
3. Goods to be Acquired:  The action is to acquire forty or more centrifuges and necessary facility items in exchange for assuming specified liability and providing rent-free use and right of return of the equipment.
4. Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: The applicable authority is 41 U.S.C. ? 3304(a)(1): "the property or services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency."  
5. Demonstration of Unique Contractor Qualifications: ACD is uniquely qualified to provide these centrifuges in meeting the critical national security requirement that enrichment technology be of U.S.-origin.  No other entity can produce the centrifuges and associated facility items necessary to continue the ongoing centrifuge RD&D program.  No other entity has the experience necessary to provide the option items.
6. Efforts to Solicit Offers From As Many Sources As Practicable: ACD is the only source that can currently provide the services, thus no other sources were solicited. As noted below in item 8, no entities expressed interest in response to a Notice of Intent.
7. Determination of Fair and Reasonably Anticipated Cost:  The anticipated value of the proposed acquisition is approximately $10,000,000.  A price analysis will be performed by the Contracting Officer to ensure a fair and reasonable price.
8. Description of Market Research Conducted:  No market research was conducted as ACD is the only entity that can provide these centrifuges based on its work on the ACP.
On May 22, 2012, a Notice of Intent was published on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website to provide information regarding DOE's intention to award a sole source contract to ACD. The notice provided interested parties the opportunity to submit questions and capability statements to DOE. No interest in this notice was received. 
9. Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:  See items 3 and 5.
10. List of Interested Sources:  None.
11. Actions to Remove or Overcome Barriers to Competition:  There are no barriers to competition that the DOE may remove. The equipment is unique and availability is a function of the market.

The warehouse contains a walk-in cooler used for storing large quantities of veterinary medicines vital for the health of the animal herds.  The work consisted of the installation of approximately 550' of new underground electrical wires underground from the switch box southwest of Bldg. #17-24 to the warehouse (Bldg. #51-24) transformer box.  Wire connections into the boxes were made at each end.  Wires were installed by boring to avoid existing underground utilities and to avoid a large quantity of excavation near Bldg. #17-24.

<DESC>1. Contracting Activity: Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), ATTN: MEE, McClellan, CA 95652-2100.<br />2. Description of Action: Approval is being requested for the purchase of test equipment and software from Agilent Technologies Inc. under GSA contract schedule, using RDTE funds. A detailed list of the test equipment and software to be purchased is attached.<br />3. Description of Supplies/Services: The contractor will supply equipment and software manufactured by Agilent Technologies and delivered to DMEA, 4234 54th Street, McClellan, CA 95652-2100. Estimated total cost of this material is $220,260.<br />4. Authority Cited: 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br />5. Reason for Authority Cited: Agilent Technologies is the only contractor who can supply test equipment and software that will mirror the Mogul Program test set up used at a classified government facility. Mirroring of equipment and software ensures compatibility of test programs used by both facilities when comparing test results on identical weapon system hardware.<br />6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: At this time, no other sources have been identified who can mirror the test set up established at the other government test facility.<br />7.a. Contracting Officer's Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination:<br />I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable and this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.<br />7.b. Procurement Analyst Concurrence:<br />Based on the above information, I hereby concur with this J&amp;A and proceeding with other than full and open competition.<br />8. Market Research: The market research that was conducted during April 2012 used the following elements to make our determination:<br />a. Contacting knowledgeable individuals in Government and Industry regarding market capabilities to meet requirements.<br />b. Reviewing catalogs and other generally available product literature published by manufacturers, distributors, and dealers or available on-line.<br />It was found that no other vendor possessed the ability to provide an identical test environment to mirror the equipment established at another government facility.<br />9. Other Facts: The test equipment and software used in assembled test environment are proprietary and are only available through Agilent Technologies. No one, other than Agilent Technologies, can supply identical hardware and software for the test environment. No second source exists for both the hardware and software components of these systems. Other vendors may provide equivalent measurement results but cannot operate with the test environment software programs.<br />10. Listing of Sources:<br />11. Actions to Increase Competition: None<br />12. Technical and Requirements Certification:<br />I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br />Agilent Technologies<br />P.O.

<DESC>1. Contracting Activity: DMEA/MEE (Contracting).<br />2. Description of Action: To accomplish its mission the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) must stay abreast of the science and technology trends that might affect the United States' ability to maintain advanced electronic and evolving microelectronic systems. A critical component of ensuring the success of the Department of Defense (DoD) advanced electronic and microelectronic systems is understanding the current interplay between policy, overall DoD strategy and DMEA's interaction with the microelectronics and technology industrial base. An area of specific additional interest is the globalization of the technology base and reliance on foreign manufacturing bases. This presents a tractable but difficult problem related to the fidelity of electronics procured from a commercial sources and as such an uncontrolled parts supply base. It is evident that there is a need to analyze the effect of this uncertainty and develop policy that ensures trusted microelectronics are used for DoD critical products. DMEA must develop a vision, enterprise roadmap and long-term strategic plan to acknowledge and adapt to this and other industry shifts and incorporate recommend policy and processes to support improved understanding, access to, and acquisition of such advanced science and technology. The contract type is a GSA order Firm Fixed Price (FFP). The action at hand, a modification, will be funded using DMEA RDT &amp;E funds. The estimated ceiling for this modification is $350,000 and the period of performance is expected to be four months. This effort builds upon a base and an option that were awarded for $390,000.00 on 2 December, 2011.<br />3. Description of Supplies/Services: In this effort, the contractor will deliver study findings and policy suggestions through analysis, prioritization and reporting on subject matter noted in SOW 12-2A8 revision one (paragraph 3.2.5) to DMEA management.<br />4. Authority Cited: 10 U.S.C.2304(c)1 , FAR 6.302-1 , Only One Responsible Source and no<br />Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br />5. Reason for Authority Cited: As a direct outgrowth of the DMEA Assessments and Strategic Planning pilot task ( 11-111 ), the base requirement was developed to provide deeper analysis and incorporate real time updates as the information base is dynamically affected by ongoing military conflicts and as such need to be updated periodically. Therefore, these 4 months of additional scope are necessary to capture recent DoD policy changes as a result ofFY13 strategic posturing. <br />The intended outcome of this task is the development of new policies that reduce the risks of a commercial industrial base, that if left unmitigated may undermine the performance and effectiveness of critical DoD weapon systems. Furthermore, the analysis of current strategic roadmap and plans for both ongoing and new initiatives will add to the veracity of DMEA's overall strategic technology plan.<br />As a result of the cumulative building of knowledge done on prior tasks, any other<br />combination of sources would have to duplicate and re-engineer the work as well as the process and methods already developed to date. As the base task is ~$390K and a "rework effort" figure of merit of 1.5 (based upon prior rework efforts) would mean that an external source would cost $585K to be prepared to begin this scope addition as a standalone effort. This would consume the entire scope addition effort of proposed work before any new analysis could be completed leading to a doubling of cost with a external source assuming that no other risk factors occurred and is not in the best interest of the Government.<br />6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: None.<br />7. Contracting Officer's Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination: I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable.<br />8. Market Research: Market research was conducted in August 2011 and updated in November 2011, prior to initialization of the basic procurement request package. Research conducted was through the GSA schedule and a search for contractors through the internet. Research has found several contractors qualified to provide a limited portion of the requirements for this effort. PIPS is the only contractor found that could fulfill all required elements of this action.<br />9. Other Facts: None.<br />10. Listing of Sources:<br />-A Non-Profit Organization<br />Potomac Institute For Policy Studies<br />901 N Stuart Street, Suite 200<br />Arlington, VA 02536<br />(703) 525-0770<br />11. Actions to Increase Competition: None.<br />12. Technical Certification:<br />I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification<br />are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br />13. Requirements Certification:<br />I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification<br />are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br />14. Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination:<br />I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government for this contract action will be<br />fair and reasonable. Actions to insure reasonableness of the price will be accomplished using<br />procedures and criteria contained in FAR 15.4. Detailed documentation and justification of price reasonableness will be set forth in the Price Negotiation Memorandum.<br />15. Procuring Contracting Officer Certification:<br />I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br />16. Procurement Analyst Concurrence:<br />Based on the above information, I hereby concur with this J&amp;A and proceeding with other than full and open competition.<br />17. Legal Counsel Concurrence:<br />Based on the above information, I hereby concur with this J&amp;A and proceeding with other than full and open competition<br />COMPETITION ADVOCATE APPROVAL: <br />Based on the foregoing justification, I hereby approve the procurement of research and analysis services on an other than full and open competition basis pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c),l subject to availability of funds, and provided that the services and property herein described have otherwise been authorized for acquisition.

<DESC>1. Summary/Introduction
<p>a) The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Medical Supply Chain, is the contracting activity.</p>
<p>b) The acquisition will result in a requirements type contract for Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion (RSDL) and Inactive Skin Decontamination Lotion (ISDL).</p>
<p>c) The total duration of this contract will be for a one-year base period and four (4) one-year option periods. The maximum dollar value for all five (5) years is $243,822,950.00.</p>
<p>d) The statutory authority for Other than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1): only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><br />2. Description of Agency's Need (10 U.S.C. 2304(f)(3)(a)):</p>
<p>I) Background</p>
<p>a) RSDL is a unique decontaminating lotion designed to reduce morbidity and mortality from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) contamination of the skin. RSDL will decontaminate Tricothecen Mycotoxin (T-2), Mustard Gas (HD), SOMAN (GD), and O-Ethyl S-Diisopropyl-aminomethyl Methyphosphonothiolate (VX) agents. RSDL was developed as an improvement to, and replacement of, the M291 Skin Decontamination Kit, manufactured by TrueTech, Inc., Riverhead NY.</p>
<p>b) ISDL is a lotion designed to imitate RSDL in color, viscosity, taste, and application. It possesses unique characteristics made to simulate the properties of RSDL in all but active ingredients. ISDL is an essential concomitant to RSDL, and is used by individual Service personnel for training in the application of RSDL.</p>
<p>c) The principle technical requirements of RSDL are to reduce toxic effects of warfare agents HD, GD, and VX to a level better that M291. In comparative testing, RSDL performed better than M291 in the following crucial areas:</p>
<p>1) Against HD agents, decontamination with RSDL resulted in lesion areas that were 50% smaller than areas treated with M291.</p>
<p>2) Animals exposed to lethal doses of GD agents are 3.5 times more likely to survive when decontaminated with RSDL than when treated with M291.</p>
<p>3) Animals exposed to lethal doses of VX agents are 7 times more likely to survive when RSDL is used compared to M291.</p>
<p>4) An additional unique characteristic of RSDL is its ability to neutralize chemical warfare agents. The M291 lotion does not neutralize the agent, but rather encapsulates it and allows the warfighter to remove the agent. The neutralizing characteristic of RSDL is the key to its superior efficacy.<br /><br />II) Description of Need/Supplies</p>
<p>a) For this acquisition, a firm fixed-price requirements type contract is planned, with an estimated annual requirement of 16,300 packages for RSDL and 3,000 for ISDL. A requirements type contract is preferred to an indefinite quantity type contract because the demand level for RSDL and ISDL has been erratic as the Services have transitioned from M291 to RSDL, and it is difficult to predict with confidence a guaranteed minimum or annual maximum amount. The total duration of this contract will be for a one-year base period and four (4) one-year option periods.</p>
<p>b) The previous contract for RSDL and ISDL was awarded by DLA Troop Support to E-Z-EM Canada, Inc. (EZEM) in June 2010. The contract, which was the first contract for these items awarded by DLA, was for a 1-year base period with a 1-year option period. Starting with that contract's pricing and applying an escalation factor of 4.2% (the use of which is based on the Global Insight long range index for pharmaceutical preparations), the total estimated dollar value for the five-year requirement is $104,542,550. The maximum dollar value, including surge, is $243,822,950.</p>
<p>3. Authority for Other than Full and Open Competition (10 U.S.C. 2304(f)(3)(B):</p>
<p>The applicable statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1): only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The only known source for the supply of RSDL and ISDL is EZEM, Anjou, Quebec, Canada. EZEM is a division of Bracco Diagnostics, an international pharmaceutical concern. Currently, EZEM is the only source that produces a skin decontaminant that is 1) FDA approved, and 2) has an efficacy that exceeds the standards of M291 Skin Decontamination Kit when decontaminating warfare agents T2, HD, GD, and VX. To date, no other firm has been found to possess the capability to produce these highly specialized items. The resultant contract will be issued to the Canadian Commercial Corporation, which is considered the prime contractor, with EZEM as subcontractor, in accordance with the procedures of DFARS 225.870. The Canadian Commercial Corp. has jurisdiction over a Canadian entity whose operations are in Canada regardless of whether the Canadian entity is a division of an international corporation.</p>
<p>4. Price/Cost Considerations (10 U.S.C. 2304(f)(3)(c)):</p>
<p>Offers from the Canadian Commercial Corporation are exempt from submission of certified cost and pricing data in accordance with DFARS 215.403-1(c)(4)(C). The undersigned Contracting Officer anticipates that the cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on an analysis of other than cost and pricing data, and the analysis performed by the Canadian Commercial Corporation, which certifies the fairness and reasonableness of the proposal it endorses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />5. Market Research/Efforts to Obtain Competition (10 U.S.C. 2304(f)(3)(D) &amp; (E)):</p>
<p>a) A Sources Sought notice was published in FedBizOpps on March 28, 2011 describing the requirements and requesting information from potential sources. The notice had a 30-day response period. The notice solicited information on products that are either finished or in the development stage. Two responses were received from manufacturers that have products in development (Albumin Therapeutics LLC and Reliapon Police Products) and were referred to the Joint Project Manager - Protection (JPM), which is the organization at Ft. Detrick responsible for determining the technical requirements of decontamination products such as RSDL.</p>
<p>b) Albumin Therapeutics makes a product called Albagen. According to JPM, this product did not meet the requirements stipulated in the synopsis. It was deemed to be a medication to promote the health and maintenance of the skin after chemical/biological/radiological/nuclear exposure and not a decontaminating agent. Additionally, the product is developmental and does not have FDA approval.</p>
<p>c) Reliapon makes a product called Bio Rescue. The company claims that this product has many of the same decontaminating properties as RSDL; however, it is not fully developed and not currently approved by the FDA. According to the firm, the product is currently sold in bulk form and used for decontaminating large areas, such as an office building. The firm is developing the product to be used directly on the human body; however, this type application is only in early testing stages. There is no probability that this product would be approved by the FDA in the time allowed to evaluate and award a contract by the target date of June 1, 2012.</p>
<p>d) As a result of this research, EZEM is still the only known source for an FDA-approved decontaminating agent with properties specified in Section 2 above.</p>
<p>e) In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(d)(2), this requirement was synopsized in FedBizOpps on August 17, 2011.</p>
<p><br />6. Actions Being Taken to Overcome Barriers to Competition (10 U.S.C. 2304 (f)(3)(F):</p>
<p>a) Skin decontaminating lotions are items used primarily by the military with very limited use by first responders and other emergency personnel. The items are designed for battlefield use by soldiers under chemical warfare attack. The expenses of capital and technological investments, and compliance with FDA regulations and licensure are prohibitive barriers to entry in this market. There are no known firms other than EZEM that have gone through this process.</p>
<p>b) DLA Troop Support will continue to post Sources Sought notices on a semi-annual basis in the FedBizOpps. Responses to these notices will be forwarded to JPM, who will continue to monitor the development of products that may be suitable alternates to RSDL. A response to these notices does not mean that the sole source status of EZEM will change in the near term. Each new product evaluation will take several months and will require the active participation of the manufacturer. The process of obtaining FDA approval, if even undertaken by the manufacturer, could take several years.</p>
<p><br />c) I hereby certify that the information contained in this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
