<DESC>Title of Project:  Accommodations for 2007 National HIV Prevention Conference 

C.1  Background and Need

The purpose of the proposed procurement is to secure adequate meeting space for the 2007 National HIV Prevention Conference, which is scheduled to be held July 29 – August 1, 2007.

The proposed procurement is to provide for conference/meeting space and accommodations for the 2007 National HIV Prevention Conference (NHPC) being held in Atlanta July 29 – August 1, 2007.  This procurement should be issued as an unfunded/no-cost purchase order.  A request for sole source with the Hyatt Regency Hotel is been submitted under separate cover.

The National HIV Prevention Conference occurs every other year, on odd years.  The four-day event typically draws 3,000 to 3,500 attendees. If the venue lacks appropriate space, success of the conference is compromised.

The proposed procurement to secure the meeting space is to be issued at no charge to CDC FY06 funds.  However, if cancellation should occur in FY07, funds will need to be obligated.

C.2  Project Objective
The purpose of the proposed procurement is to secure adequate meeting space for the 2007 National HIV Prevention Conference, which is scheduled to be held July 29 – August 1, 2007.  

C.3  Scope of Work

The hotel/conference facility must be capable of providing the meeting space and services listed below:
•	Unobstructed viewing, single theatre/venue space with seating capacity to accommodate up to 3,500 attendees and conference presenters. 
•	Space for 16 concurrent sessions, theater style with seating capacity for 80-600 attendees
•	Separate exhibit area to house 60-100 exhibitors each with space of 10ft x 10ft, in addition to 300 poster presentations
•	Executive conference room for media (capable of housing 10 laptops with Internet connectivity, photo copier, fax, printer and three telephones)
•	Executive conference room for press conferences (housing a stage with backdrop, theatre seating capacity of 20-40, and AV equipment)
•	Executive conference room for Volunteer Coordination Office (housing two computers, one printer, with seating for at least 20 and standing room for 50 at any given time)
•	Small meeting room to house Scholarship Coordination Office (houses red core locking mechanism for thousands of dollars dispersed as per diem with City of Atlanta Police, Hotel security, and two Scholarship coordinators)
•	Accommodations/Lounge for 20-25 Persons Living With AIDS (houses light food and beverage, a full size refrigerator for medications, a bathroom, chairs, sofas, and at least two cots for rest)
•	Continuing Education (CE) Room (must house a minimum of 15 computers with Internet connectivity to run the CE online process throughout the conference and administration of the process by two CE coordinators)
•	Conference Office/Evaluation Coordination Room (houses 50-60 boxes of evaluations to be coordinated with volunteers, a computer with Internet connectivity, printer and  photo copier for any needed onsite changes, desk, large conference table, 50 chairs, refrigerator, and bathroom. This room will be used as the site for coordination of evaluation staff as well as a place for all conference staff to meet at all hours of the day and evening).
•	Sleeping rooms for conference attendees — minimum 1,000 rooms at prevailing U.S. Government per diem rates.

C.4  Technical Requirements

The tasks expected of the meeting facility contractor are as outlined in C.3 above.  The magnitude and complexity of the conference are considerable, but inasmuch as the hotel essentially is providing the meeting space and pertinent services, there are no realistic “technical requirements” per se.

C.5  Reporting Schedule

Because of current high demand for meeting space in Atlanta (due in large part to Hurrican Katrina), it is necessary to formally contract for this meeting space over 18 months in advance of the actual conference.  Once the procurement with the hotel has been finalized, no further contractual or reporting requirements are expected. 
 
C.6  Special Considerations

The hotel cancellation provision and attrition issues are a special consideration.  As has been the case with the four preceding conference, the hotel offers the meeting space at no cost.  This is predicated on the assurance of 80% of the sleeping rooms being picked up and CDC not canceling the meeting.  However, in the event CDC is required to cancel the conference, in FY07, CDC will be liable for reasonable cancellation and attrition charges. 

Approximately three nights are designated as peak nights: July 29th, July 30th and July 31st.  The non-peak nights would be July 27th, 28th, and August 1st.

C.7  Government Furnished Property  

Approximately 20 pieces of CDC Audio-Visual equipment, 20 laptops, and 20 lazer pointers will be brought to the conference. 

C.8  References –

No applicable references. 

Deliverables – 

Contracted space listed above at the dates specified.

The GPSOC will provide high fidelity information including detailed GPS performance assessments tailored specifically for the use of DoD and theater warfighting forces. This information is intended for use as decision-making tools in the operational planning and execution process. The GPSOC will provide monitoring of the performance of the GPS constellation and its constituent subsystems. It will respond to DoD, United States Coast Guard (USCG) Navigation Center (NAVCEN), and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Operations Control Center (NOCC) problem reports and requests for information, and coordinate the collection, analysis, and distribution of information related to all GPS related anomalies through the 50 SW command structure in support of military, civil, and allied operations across the full spectrum of conflict.

<DESC>A previous sources sought noticed was posted on FEDBIZOPPS under “FA4890-05-CAT/CWD.”  All current and future postings will now occur under the solicitation number “FA4890-06-R-0157.”  

As a result of the earlier sources sought notice and careful small business capability evaluation, it has been decided to keep this follow-on contract requirement as FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION rather than set-aside solely for small businesses.  All vendors, regardless of size are encouraged to provide proposals for this requirement.

Accompanying this posting is a DRAFT Statement of Work (revised from earlier posting), DRAFT DD 254, and DRAFT Solicitation.  At this time, we are requesting INDUSTRY COMMENTS on everything posted including: perceived errors, clarifications, suggestions (contract CLIN format, SOW wording, evaluation factors, instructions, etc.).  This is an excellent opportunity for contractors to provide the Government with constructive feedback, which could affect the structure and format of the final version RFP that is scheduled to be posted in January 2006.   DO NOT PROVIDE PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME!  

The final RFP is estimated to be posted to FEDBIZOPPS o/a January 9, 2006.  However, if time allows, the final RFP may be posted earlier during the month of December.  Proposals based on the final RFP are scheduled to be due 14 Feb 2006.  It will be the responsibility of the offerors to monitor the FEDBIZOPPS site for further postings.  The government plans to use the Internet (FEDBIZOPPS) and e-mail as the primary means of disseminating and exchanging information throughout this acquisition process.  

A synopsis of the Fighter Contracted Aircrew Training and Courseware Development (CAT/CWD) requirement is included below:

Air Combat Command (ACC) is purchasing CAT/CWD services for the F-15C, F-15E, F-16, and F/A-22 aircraft at locations within the Continental United States (CONUS).  The aircrew training will consist of academic and ground device instruction.  Seymour Johnson AFB, NC is the primary place of performance for courseware development and will support the F-15E Formal Training Unit (FTU).  Aircrew training and limited courseware development will occur at Mission Training Center (MTC) and Full Mission Trainer (FMT) sites in support of Distributed Missions Training (DMT).  These sites include Seymour-Johnson AFB NC (F-15E MTC), Eglin AFB FL (F-15C MTC), Langley AFB VA (F-15C MTC and F/A-22 FMT), Shaw AFB SC (F-16 CJ MTC), Mountain Home AFB ID (F-16 CJ and F-15E MTCs).   Other aircrew training places of performance with older legacy systems include Cannon AFB NM (F-16 UTD), Mountain Home AFB ID (F-15C WST), Hill AFB UT (F-16 UTD).  

The successful offeror will assume full training and courseware commitments for the basic contract year on 1 Oct 06 through 30 Sep 07.  (Phase-in will be accomplished prior to 30 Sep 06.)  Four one-year options are planned for the period beginning 1 Oct 07 and ending 30 Sep 11.

A qualified contractor will be selected using a Two-step, No-go “Low Price Technically Acceptable” (LPTA) source selection procedure, in accordance with Part 15 of the FAR.  Moreover, this will be a lump sum, fixed-price contract not set aside for small businesses. During step one of the Two-step LPTA, offers will be evaluated against the Go/No-go qualification factors.  Proposals found to be acceptable will then move on to step two of the evaluation process, during which price proposals will be opened and evaluated.  It is the Government’s intention to award the project to the lowest-priced bidder.  The bidder must also meet the Government’s standards of responsiveness and responsibility.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations if it is in its best interest to do so.

All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitations.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  
 
The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This is a Request for Quote (RFQ) that will be evaluated using Best Value procedures.  The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) intends to purchase one (1) each Hydrostatic Test System to Simulate Ocean Depths.  All quotes shall be Firm-Fixed Price and include costs for all equipment; materials; labor; installation; service agreements; training; operator and maintenance manuals; and warranty.  This system must meet or exceed the performance characteristics outlined in the attached performance specification:  NDBC SPECIFICATION FOR PROCUREMENT OF HYDROSTATIC TEST SYSTEM TO SIMULATE OCEAN DEPTHS.  The RFQ and specification are available for downloading on this website.  This specification contains the requirements for a turnkey hydrostatic test system to simulate various ocean depths.  Preference is for a system that can control temperature as well.  This system is to be used by NDBC to test tsunami detection bottom mounted pressure sensors and related systems.  The Hydrostatic Test System is to be installed in a non-environmentally controlled high bay building located on the John C. Stennis Space Center, Mississippi.  John C. Stennis Space Center is located approximately 48 miles west of Biloxi, Mississippi and 45 miles east of New Orleans, Louisiana.  The desired delivery date is ninety (90) calendar days following award.

The Government anticipates awarding a purchase order to the offeror whose quote is the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  All quotes will be evaluated based on Technical, Past Performance, and Price.   The Technical and Past Performance evaluation factors are significantly more important than Price.   Technical is more important than Past Performance.  This Award will be made on a Best Value basis.  Award may be made to other than the lowest priced technically acceptable quote.  The Government, at its discretion, may award this purchase order without discussions.  Offerors shall identify and document all (if any) assumptions, conditions, or exceptions upon which the technical part of this quote is based.  All assumptions shall be included in the quote.  The following evaluation factors will be utilized:

A. GO/NO-GO FACTORS.

The Government will not evaluate any quotes that do not meet the following GO/NO-GO Factors:

1.  Able to achieve operating pressure of 10,000 PSI
2.  Able to maintain pressure for a minimum of 72 hrs within 2 percent of the target within the full operating range of the system
3.  Test Volume minimum size of 24 inches in diameter x 78 inches long/tall
4.  Constructed to National Board Registered and ASME Certified Conditions
5.  Design provides for safety of users (addressed in proposal)

B. NON-COST EVALUATION FACTORS.

The Government will evaluate quotes based on the following non-cost factors:

1. TECHNICAL.
Quotes will be reviewed to evaluate the offeror’s understanding of the requirement and capability to provide the best system that compliments long term program objectives.  The sub-factors for this major factor include:  
i. Long Term Maintenance:  This sub-factor will evaluate the ease of operation and maintenance; availability of parts/materials for repairs; required skills needed to perform maintenance; warranty terms and conditions; maintenance service agreement terms and conditions; and environmental disposal considerations. 
ii. Safety: This sub-factor will evaluate operator shielding; mechanical design factor of safety; interlock equipment and overrides; and ability to be locked out.
iii. Operations/Testing:  This sub-factor will evaluate ability to control temperature; operational test and maintenance procedures/inspections; ease of use; cycle time; data logging capability/time series/diagnostics; and the number of cable penetrations/flexibility
iv. Delivery Schedule:  This sub-factor will evaluate the speed of delivery of the system.
2.  PAST PERFORMANCE.   
The Government is seeking to determine whether the Offeror consistently delivers quality services in a timely manner.  This factor will be evaluated on the basis of relevant past performance for each Offeror and proposed teaming partners, during the last three years, on contracts/purchase orders consistent in scope and complexity with the objectives of this Request for Quote.  The information presented in the Offeror’s quote, together with information from any other sources available to the Government (i.e., Government-controlled Contractor performance databases, Inspector General reports, General Accounting Office reports, newspaper articles, references including contractual, technical, and end-user representatives, etc.) will provide the input for evaluation of this factor.  Include points of contact and their phone numbers, titles, and size of procurement in dollar value.  Each reference shall include a contracting and technical point of contact.  

If the Offeror has no single experience that encompasses all types of past performance defined in the solicitation, the Offeror may show past performance through a combination of projects that together show that work has been accomplished that is consistent in scope and complexity.  The past performance information may include the Offeror’s record of providing high quality services in a timely manner, standards of good workmanship, adhering to contract schedules, administrative aspects of contract performance, overall quality of assigned personnel, availability, stability, reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to 
and business-like concern for the interests of the customer, quality of overall program management approach, record of awards or performance recognition earned, and overall client satisfaction.  

Past performance that is technically relevant to this requirement will be of more value than non-relevant past performance.  A lack of relevant past performance data will be treated by the Government as a neutral evaluation.

All quotes shall provide enough information for the Government to conduct its evaluation.  Any quotes received without the required information may be removed from consideration.  This solicitation is 100% Total Small Business Set-Aside.  See Numbered Note #1.  The NAICS Code is 334519 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  All quotes must be submitted no later than 4:00pm Central on December 6, 2005.  Offerors may mail, fax, or e-mail quotes to the contact information below:

<DESC>The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) is one of the hallmark efforts currently underway on agricultural health in the United States.  The study was initiated in 1993 by 3 lead organizations including: The National Cancer Institute (NCI), The National Institute of Environmental Health Scientists (NIEHS), and The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The study uses a longitudinal cohort design and evaluates how lifestyle habits, genetic factors, and agricultural exposures at work and in the environment contribute to the risk of disease.  Over 89,000 certified farmer pesticide applicators and their spouses from North Carolina and Iowa and licensed commercial pesticide applicators from Iowa are included in the study making it one of the largest agricultural health studies ever conducted in the United States.  The AHS is now in the third round.  Initial study efforts focused on pesticide exposures in the etiology of various cancers.  However, more recent efforts have begun to address other health outcomes including kidney disease, nervous system disorders, reproductive effects, and respiratory disease.  This large cohort provides a unique opportunity for the study of respiratory health outcomes in agriculture including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and chronic bronchitis with the study of both prevalent and incident disease patterns as well as risk factors related to pesticide and non-pesticide exposures.    The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) plans to contribute funding directly to the two contractors selected for the field testing of respiratory questions/questionnaires for this third round of the AHS.  The respiratory disease portions of the  Study will be conducted by the Battelle Memorial Institute in Baltimore, MD for the North Carolina Field Station and the University of Iowa, College of Public Health, Iowa City, IA, for the Iowa Field Station.  These two contractors were selected through a competition by the NCI, EPA, and NIEHS to complete the third round of the questionnaire surveys.  Only these approved NCI/EPA/NIEHS contractors would have access to the databases / study participant rosters to complete these interviews including the respiratory health questionnaire components.  Additionally, these contractors have experience with this large cohort and have demonstrated competency during previous surveys.  This notice is being posted for information purposes only.   All information received will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Acquisitions Management and Operations Branch (AMOB) has a sole source modification for security guard services at Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Hamilton, MT.  Contract N02-AO-40060 with Side Bar & Associates, Inc. will be modified to add 6-8 additional security guard positions beginning in February 2006.  This increase will continue through the current option year ending June 30, 2006 and through all remaining option years.  Positions may be armed and unarmed.  Side Bar and Associates is the only available source for this requirement.  Side Bar currently provides all security guard services for the RML campus.  Security requirements on the campus require all security staff to be inter-changeable and to work in a cohesive environment.  The combination of two different companies could pose a security risk if the company’s policies and procedures differ.   In addition, the combination of two different security guard companies would require additional supervision, as Side Bar’s supervisors would not be able to supervise another contractor’s employees and vice versa.  Additional supervisors would result in duplication of costs.  For these reasons, it is in the Government’s best interest to obtain all security services for the RML campus from one security company.  All inquiries regarding this modification should be directed to Ivan Hernandez by February 6, 2006 at ihernandez@niaid.nih.gov.  See note 22.

<DESC>The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), a wholly-owned Federal Government Corporation, intends to award a contract to a qualified vendor who can provide physical examinations for AmeriCorps*NCCC, a residential national service program operated by the CNCS.  The AmeriCorps*NCCC engages young people ages 18 – 24 in team based service on projects in local communities throughout designated regions of the country.  The Central Region Campus is located at 3001 South Federal Blvd., Denver, Colorado and serves local community projects, as well as projects in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana and Michigan.  In case of disaster relief (i.e. Gulf Region hurricanes, forest fires), members may be sent to other state locations. 

During January 3, 2006 approximately 33 Team Leaders and on January 23, 2006, 260 Corps Members will arrive on the Central Region Campus with the understanding that each will have to take a physical examination similar to a pre-employment screening upon program entry.  Our program is rigorous with several essential work functions that make it imperative to assess each member’s fitness to perform safely in the program. Therefore, a health care provider is needed to conduct a physical examination on each member.

The physical exams will be conducted during two phases and includes several component parts in addition to a 10 panel drug test, “PPD testing” for tuberculosis and tetanus shots. 
 
Phase I - On January 3, 2006, 33 Team Leaders arrive on campus.  We would like to arrange for a physical examination at the provider’s facility on Wednesday, January 4, 2006, 1:30 pm to 5:00 pm.

Phase II - On January 23, 2006 additional members arrive on campus.  We would like to have the physical and drug testing to be done at the medical provider’s facility (one location).  Would like to schedule 65 members each day for 4 days, January 25, January 26 January 27 and January 28, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. We are requesting sufficient medical personnel be provided to insure the adequate, timely processing of approximately 65 members within a 8 hour day.  If some of the examination requirements cannot be provided on-site, the provider may submit alternatives for completing all requirements.

•	In addition, we require the results of the drug testing within 24 hours of the last test. TB PPD skin tests are to be read within 48-72 hours following the application. Medically trained personnel will read and evaluate the members TB skin results.

If Corps Members have medical conditions considered dangerous to their health if left untreated (e.g. previously unknown glucosuria or proteinuria, hypertension, possibility of malignancy, or any other defect that may jeopardize the Corps Member’s health), physicians will inform them orally of the problem and advise them to seek medical attention. The physician will document the findings and notify the NCCC staff liaison.

The requirements of the provider to perform the physical examination process are as follows: 
All medical providers (Doctors (M.D.s, D.O.s); Physician Assistants; Nurse Practitioners) performing or overseeing the performance of the physical examinations must have current, appropriate professional licenses to perform medical and other related services.

If Certified Physician Assistants and/or Certified Nurse Practitioners are utilized, an Internal Medicine Physician and/or Family Practitioner must also be on the premises performing or overseeing the performance of the medical examinations.

When the examining physician is of the opposite sex or when a member requests it, same-sex chaperones must be provided (there are significantly more female members than males – it is important that a sufficient number of female chaperones be made available).
 
A.	THE SCOPE OF THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS: 
    
•	A medical provider in a private one-on-one session will examine the mouth, eyes, lymph nodes, lungs, heart, breasts (females only), abdomen, and/or inguinal hernia/testicular exam (males only) of each member.

•	Dental review  (determine acceptability only)

•	Urine-albumin and sugar (reagent strips)

Tuberculosis test (PPD), chest x-ray with positive PPD

•	Physician recommendations for follow-up, as needed.


B.  DOCUMENTATION OF FINDINGS:

•	Provider’s physicians and technicians will document all findings on an agreed upon medical form that will be in the members medical chart to address the component parts of the physical examinations.

•	The physician will document if the examined member has any abnormalities that may preclude him/her from participating in rigorous physical activity and/or performing in the AmeriCorps*NCCC program.   

•	The provider will give the documented charts to AmeriCorps*NCCC Personnel, identified as the AmeriCorps*NCCC Liaison.  

C.	OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PROVIDER  

•	To review the AmeriCorps Medical/Mental Health Information Form on all members prior to the examination.  

•	To follow the prescribed Physical Examination for AmeriCorps*NCCC members.  The physical exam elements will not exceed those mentioned in the scope of work and be consistent for both the team leaders and members.  

•	To ensure injured or acutely ill members receive emergency medical treatment in the event of such emergency during their course of stay at the vendor’s facility, if the exams are not conducted on campus.  After applying measures necessary to sustain life and to reduce the possibility of further injury, the providers’ staff will, if necessary, call an ambulance.  All such cases will be reported immediately to the AmeriCorps*NCCC Liaison. 


 
D.	EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES AND FACILITIES:   

•	The provider will provide all equipment and supplies necessary to perform all services (including patient gowns and drapes).  Regardless of where the physical exam is held, member privacy must be maintained and adequate space must be provided in the performance of all services.

E.	THIRD PARTIES:  

•	It is recognized that some services such as laboratory testing for drug screens may be sub-contracted out by the contractor.  All sub-contracted facilities must be properly credentialed to provide the service. The contractor must include all costs associated with third party examination requirements. 
 
F.	RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTIES:

There will be two parties to carry out the terms of this procurement.  The parties are:  The medical provider and AmeriCorps*NCCC.

1. The medical provider will ensure the completion of the following components: the examination, the assessment, and all documentation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Title of Project:  Accommodations for 2007 National HIV Prevention Conference 

C.1  Background and Need

The purpose of the proposed procurement is to secure adequate meeting space for the 2007 National HIV Prevention Conference, which is scheduled to be held July 29 – August 1, 2007.

The proposed procurement is to provide for conference/meeting space and accommodations for the 2007 National HIV Prevention Conference (NHPC) being held in Atlanta July 29 – August 1, 2007.  

The National HIV Prevention Conference occurs every other year, on odd years.  The four-day event typically draws 3,000 to 3,500 attendees. If the venue lacks appropriate space, success of the conference is compromised.

The proposed procurement to secure the meeting space is to be issued at no charge to CDC FY06 funds.  However, if cancellation should occur in FY07, funds will need to be obligated.

C.2  Project Objective
The purpose of the proposed procurement is to secure adequate meeting space for the 2007 National HIV Prevention Conference, which is scheduled to be held July 29 – August 1, 2007.  

C.3  Scope of Work

The hotel/conference facility must be capable of providing the meeting space and services listed below:
•	Unobstructed viewing, single theatre/venue space with seating capacity to accommodate up to 3,500 attendees and conference presenters. 
•	Space for 16 concurrent sessions, theater style with seating capacity for 80-600 attendees
•	Separate exhibit area to house 60-100 exhibitors each with space of 10ft x 10ft, in addition to 300 poster presentations
•	Executive conference room for media (capable of housing 10 laptops with Internet connectivity, photo copier, fax, printer and three telephones)
•	Executive conference room for press conferences (housing a stage with backdrop, theatre seating capacity of 20-40, and AV equipment)
•	Executive conference room for Volunteer Coordination Office (housing two computers, one printer, with seating for at least 20 and standing room for 50 at any given time)
•	Small meeting room to house Scholarship Coordination Office (houses red core locking mechanism for thousands of dollars dispersed as per diem with City of Atlanta Police, Hotel security, and two Scholarship coordinators)
•	Accommodations/Lounge for 20-25 Persons Living With AIDS (houses light food and beverage, a full size refrigerator for medications, a bathroom, chairs, sofas, and at least two cots for rest)
•	Continuing Education (CE) Room (must house a minimum of 15 computers with Internet connectivity to run the CE online process throughout the conference and administration of the process by two CE coordinators)
•	Conference Office/Evaluation Coordination Room (houses 50-60 boxes of evaluations to be coordinated with volunteers, a computer with Internet connectivity, printer and  photo copier for any needed onsite changes, desk, large conference table, 50 chairs, refrigerator, and bathroom. This room will be used as the site for coordination of evaluation staff as well as a place for all conference staff to meet at all hours of the day and evening).
•	Sleeping rooms for conference attendees — minimum 1,000 rooms at prevailing U.S. Government per diem rates.

C.4  Technical Requirements

The tasks expected of the meeting facility contractor are as outlined in C.3 above.  The magnitude and complexity of the conference are considerable, but inasmuch as the hotel essentially is providing the meeting space and pertinent services, there are no realistic “technical requirements” per se.

C.5  Reporting Schedule

Because of current high demand for meeting space in Atlanta (due in large part to Hurrican Katrina), it is necessary to formally contract for this meeting space over 18 months in advance of the actual conference.  Once the procurement with the hotel has been finalized, no further contractual or reportint is necessary to formally contract for this meeting space over 18 months in advance of the actual conference.  Once the procurement with the hotel has been finalized, no further contractual or reporting requirements are expected. 
 
C.6  Special Considerations

The hotel cancellation provision and attrition issues are a special consideration.  As has been the case with the four preceding conference, the hotel offers the meeting space at no cost.  This is predicated on the assurance of 80% of the sleeping rooms being picked up and CDC not canceling the meeting.  However, in the event CDC is required to cancel the conference, in FY07, CDC will be liable for reasonable cancellation and attrition charges. 

Approximately three nights are designated as peak nights: July 29th, July 30th and July 31st.  The non-peak nights would be July 27th, 28th, and August 1st.

C.7  Government Furnished Property  

Approximately 20 pieces of CDC Audio-Visual equipment, 20 laptops, and 20 lazer pointers will be brought to the conference. 

C.8  References –

No applicable references. 

Deliverables – 

Contracted space listed above at the dates specified.

C.4  Technical Requirements

The tasks expected of the meeting facility contractor are as outlined in C.3 above.  The magnitude and complexity of the conference are considerable, but inasmuch as the hotel essentially is providing the meeting space and pertinent services, there are no realistic “technical requirements” per se.

C.5  Reporting Schedule

Because of current high demand for meeting space in Atlanta (due in large part to Hurrican Katrina), ig requirements are expected. 
 
C.6  Special Considerations

The hotel cancellation provision and attrition issues are a special consideration.  As has been the case with the four preceding conference, the hotel offers the meeting space at no cost.  This is predicated on the assurance of 80% of the sleeping rooms being picked up and CDC not canceling the meeting.  However, in the event CDC is required to cancel the conference, in FY07, CDC will be liable for reasonable cancellation and attrition charges. 

Approximately three nights are designated as peak nights: July 29th, July 30th and July 31st.  The non-peak nights would be July 27th, 28th, and August 1st.

C.7  Government Furnished Property  

Approximately 20 pieces of CDC Audio-Visual equipment, 20 laptops, and 20 lazer pointers will be brought to the conference. 

C.8  References –

No applicable references.

3.  Delete paragraph 4) SECTION VII. PROPOSAL EVALUATION of Modification 04, dated December 15, 2005.  Section VIII. PROPOSAL EVALUATION, paragraph A. 1, Selection Process Overview, First-Tier review is revised as follows:

FROM:

A.	Selection Process Overview

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished in a two-tier, peer or scientific review process.  

	1.  The first-tier is a scientific peer review of proposals as follows:

	For individual research and development projects, a review is first made of the research summaries as required in Section VI. PROPOSAL PREPARATION, G. 1.  Only the proposals for those research summaries that are most highly qualified will then be evaluated in accordance with the stated evaluation criteria.   The evaluation criteria, listed Section G, are specific to the respective approach that is proposed.  

	Integrated Technical/Management Arrangements will be evaluated in accordance with the stated criteria.

TO:

A.	Selection Process Overview

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished in a two-tier, peer or scientific review process.  

	1.	The first-tier is a scientific peer review of proposals against established criteria.  The evaluation criteria, listed in this Section, are specific to the respective approach that is proposed.  For the Individual Research and Development Projects, proposers will submit a research summary for each individual project concurrently with their proposal.  


 
4.  The answer to Question No. 5 is revised as follows:

QUESTION:

The project will be managed and essentially executed from our site. However, we are considering locating some of our scientists at sites in Spain or the UK. Provided we can assure this won't prove a hindrance to the project is it acceptable to have some scientists funded by this grant located at our sites in Spain or the UK? 

REVISED ANSWER:

Section IX. GENERAL INFORMATION, paragraph B, states that the participation of foreign companies will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 120-130, implement the laws governing the export control of defense articles or services (including technical data) subject to the US Munitions List (see 22 CFR 121.1).   "Export" includes oral or written transfer of information to foreign persons, whether in the US or abroad (see 22 CFR 120.17).  "Foreign persons" includes individuals that are not lawful permanent residents (see definition in 22 CFR 120.16).   If items or information are export-controlled, the offeror would be required to first obtain an export license from the State Dept Office of Defense Trade Controls (ODTC) in order to export them. 
 
If the items/information are not subject to the ITAR, they may fall under the Department of Commerce Commodity Control List and require an export license under the Export Administration Regulations (see15 CFR Parts 730, 732, 734, 736, 738, 740).   "Export" includes transfer to foreign persons, whether in the US or abroad.  "Foreign persons" includes individuals that are not lawful permanent residents (see 15 CFR 734.2(b)). 

Section V, PROCUREMENT INSTRUMENTS, paragraph A, of the BAA was amended in modification 03 dated December 9, 2005 to exclude Grants as a potential procurement instrument.  


 
5.  The answer to Question No. 8 is revised as follows:

QUESTION:

Can you advise whether we will have the opportunity to engage in dialogue with DTRA regarding our proposal once it has been reviewed? Or will it simply be reviewed and provided with a go/no-go decision?

REVISED ANSWER:

Yes, negotiations of terms and conditions of any procurement instrument will be made following the review process.  There will be no other dialogue anticipated during the evaluation of proposals.  Proposers will be notified of the status of their proposal in writing and may be provided a debrief upon completion of the award process.

6.  The answer to Question No. 28 is revised as follows:

QUESTION:

The information submitted in the technical proposal will contain confidential and proprietary information.  We would like to gain some insight into the government’s understanding of confidentiality. Will the contents of proposals be maintained as confidential by the government or will they be a matter of public record? We understand that a review process will take place, however will the review process be facilitated by government officials (government eyes only) or with the assistance of external experts? What obligations of confidentiality will this panel of experts be held to? Further, if awarded a grant, will the research projects under the grant be subject to confidentiality provisions between the government and the grant awardee? 


REVISED ANSWER:

Section IX. GENERAL INFORMATION is revised by Modification 07 to add paragraph K, ACCESS TO PROPRIETY INFORMATION as follows:

Participation in the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) DTRA01-06-BAA-01 requires SRA International and Northrop Grumman employees to have access to DTRA contractor information including information that may be considered proprietary.  This BAA contains organizational conflict of interest provisions and includes contractual specifications for non-disclosure of proprietary contractor information.  All proposers to BAA DTRA01-06-BAA-01 consent to the disclosure of their information to SRA and Northrop Grumman employees under these conditions.

In reference to grants, Section V, PROCUREMENT INSTRUMENTS, paragraph A, of the BAA was amended in modification 03 dated December 9, 2005 to exclude Grants as a potential procurement instrument.  



7.  The answer to Question No. 51 is revised as follows:

51. 
QUESTION:
While the BAA specifically mentions genetic diversity, the pathogenicity of natural isolates, and common virulence mechanisms such as TTSS, it also mentions that agent classes to be focused on are intra-cellular bacterial pathogens, hemorrhagic fever viruses and bioregulators.  Because V. cholerae does not fit exactly into these agent classes per se, I was hoping that you might be able to provide some insight as to whether my studies (as briefly described above) would constitute a suitable proposal for submission.  That is, do you expect to solicit proposals that focus on agents of bioterrorism and disease outside of those specifically mentioned in the BAA?
REVISED ANSWER: 

The focus and intent of the BAA is described in Section I, INTRODUCTION, paragraph 3 of the BAA.


 
8.  The answer to Question No. 91 is revised as follows:

91.

Question:  

Our institute utilizes both targeted gene approaches to therapeutic development of drugs as well as novel vaccine platforms. We have developed a large capacity vaccine platform that can deliver effective protective immunity to multiple pathogens considered important bioterrorist threats that we feel will revolutionize the vaccine industry. Would this subject also be with the scope of the BAA announcement?

Revised Answer:

The focus and intent of the BAA is described in Section I, INTRODUCTION, paragraph 3 of the BAA.


9.  The answer to Question No. 141 is revised as follows:

141.

Question:  

Can you explain what loaded labor rates are?  Are these hourly rates?

Revised Answer:

In Section VI. PROPOSAL PREPARATION. A.2, the last sentence, All pricing information, such as loaded labor rates, shall be rounded to the nearest penny, was deleted in modification 04 of the FedBizOpps notice.

<DESC>A previous sources sought noticed was posted on FEDBIZOPPS under “FA4890-05-CAT/CWD.”  All current and future postings will now occur under the solicitation number “FA4890-06-R-0157.”  

As a result of the earlier sources sought notice and careful small business capability evaluation, it has been decided to keep this follow-on contract requirement as FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION rather than set-aside solely for small businesses.  All vendors, regardless of size are encouraged to provide proposals for this requirement.

Proposals based on the final RFP are scheduled to be due 14 Feb 2006.  It will be the responsibility of the offerors to monitor the FEDBIZOPPS site for further postings.  The government plans to use the Internet (FEDBIZOPPS) and e-mail as the primary means of disseminating and exchanging information throughout this acquisition process.  

A synopsis of the Fighter Contracted Aircrew Training and Courseware Development (CAT/CWD) requirement is included below:

Air Combat Command (ACC) is purchasing CAT/CWD services for the F-15C, F-15E, F-16, and F/A-22 aircraft at locations within the Continental United States (CONUS).  The aircrew training will consist of academic and ground device instruction.  Seymour Johnson AFB, NC is the primary place of performance for courseware development and will support the F-15E Formal Training Unit (FTU).  Aircrew training and limited courseware development will occur at Mission Training Center (MTC) and Full Mission Trainer (FMT) sites in support of Distributed Missions Training (DMT).  These sites include Seymour-Johnson AFB NC (F-15E MTC), Eglin AFB FL (F-15C MTC), Langley AFB VA (F-15C MTC and F/A-22 FMT), Shaw AFB SC (F-16 CJ MTC), Mountain Home AFB ID (F-16 CJ and F-15E MTCs).   Other aircrew training places of performance with older legacy systems include Cannon AFB NM (F-16 UTD), Mountain Home AFB ID (F-15C WST), Hill AFB UT (F-16 UTD).  

The successful offeror will assume full training and courseware commitments for the basic contract year on 1 Oct 06 through 30 Sep 07.  (Phase-in will be accomplished prior to 30 Sep 06.)  Four one-year options are planned for the period beginning 1 Oct 07 and ending 30 Sep 11.  

Proposals shall be mailed to:  ACC CONS/LGCB, Attn:  Ryan McCauley, 130 Douglas Street, Suite 401, Langley AFB, VA  23665.  The cutoff date for receipt of proposals is 14 Feb 2006  at 5:00 pm EST.

<DESC>Since there was mistake with the solicitation number, this solicitation, R134106RP0023 is going to be cancelled and reissued as RA134106RP0023. 

The original posting of R134106RP0023 announced that NIST would issue an RFP around December 21, 2005. Without realizing that the number was wrong, the RFP was posted to the same number on December 22, 2005. The incorrect number was then dedected. The only solution is to point prospective offerors to a new solicitation number. To have a complete package in one place, the original notice will also be reposted with the new number (RA134106RP0023). Sorry for the confusion.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   Amendment 1:  Synopsis/RFQ, RFQ-OH-06-00042 "Development of an Ohio MARKAL Database".  The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions purposed by offerors of the synopsis/solicitation. Question 1: At this time, does the offeror have to provide information for  Phase II and Phase III in order to be eligible for future funding?  Or can we reply at a later date when it is clear that the funding will be available. In other words, if we don't offer Phase II and Phase III data by January 6, 2006, does that make us ineligible to be considered for a future  contract under this project? Answer:  As stated in the synopsis/request for quote offerors must provide a quote for all phases by the response date to be considered for this requirement.  One technical approach can be used in regards to all three phases but a quote for each phase is necessary. The  response date for this Synopsis/RFQ is Jan. 6, 2005 at 5:00PM.  All documents may be accessed through the EPA's home page on the World Wide Web (www.epa.gov). The direct link URL is http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  It is the responsibility of offerors to frequently check FEDBIZOPPS or the EPA  website address for updates or changes. No hard copies will be available.

<DESC>Purpose:  The United States Navy seeks to identify potential sources to perform as the single Product Support Integrator (PSI) for sustaining the Navy/Marine Corp and US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) V-22 aircraft variants.  

Program Description:  The MV-22 aircraft will replace the existing Marine Corps CH-46 and CH-53D helicopters.  The CV 22 aircraft will provide the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) a tilt-rotor aircraft capable of performing  long-range Special Operations Forces (SOF) missions.  The CV-22 retains 88 percent airframe, 100 percent propulsion, and 23 percent avionics commonality with the MV-22.  The program of record includes 360 MV-22 and 50 CV-22 aircraft and an additional 48 HV-22 Fleet Logistics Support, Aerial Refueling and Special Warfare variants. 

Government’s Intent:  The V-22 Program Office (PMA –275) is pursuing a systems-level performance based logistics (PBL) strategy to meet sustainment requirements for MV-22 and CV-22 users.  The intent is to create a sustainment support structure that is comprehensive, responsive to Warfighter requirements and affordable. The Navy’s intent is that the first long-term sustainment PBL contract will be awarded no later than June 2008. The planned length of the initial PBL contract is five years.   

Scope:  Under this PBL, the PSI will share authority, responsibility and risk with the Government for sustainment efficiency and effectiveness. The PSI must establish a formal network that supports long-term relationships and agreements with activities that supply or manage many elements of the V-22 system. This includes: NAVAIR Logistics and Engineering elements and Fleet Support Team, the V-22 original equipment manufacturer (OEM), OEM suppliers and vendors, the Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP), and other government inventory control activities including the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  The V-22 is a ‘core’ weapon system under Title 10 USC 2469 provisions. Public-private partnering is a critical part of the V-22 PBL strategy.  The PSI will team, as appropriate, with Naval Aviation Depots, NAVAIR and AFSOC engineering and logistics support facilities, and other activities, which manage components of the MV-22 and CV-22. The contract will incentivize the pursuit of long-term V-22 fleet Operations and Support (O&S) cost reduction initiatives. A key requirement for the PSI will be the ability to work with PMA-275 and supporting Government activities to provide continuous logistics support within the framework of an active modification program, with the systems engineering and configuration management capability that this entails. The Government has procured technical data for this weapon system, to include technical drawings for V-22-peculiar components. This PBL effort includes: aircraft-common supply support for all aircraft models, flight simulators and maintenance training devices, upgrade capability for maintenance trainers, technical data packages (MIL-T-3100) and data base access for training system updates, courseware and curriculum changes.  This PBL effort excludes: engines, common support equipment that will be managed and supported separately and components supported by existing PBLs, where inclusion in this contract is not supported by a business case analysis. The PSI will be required to provide software support capabiltities, although the Government will retain overall software support management authority.

Roles and Responsibilities: PMA-275 is the weapon system manager for the operational life of the V-22 fleet and will retain overall authority and accountability for sustainment including operational safety, suitability and effectiveness, configuration control and affordability.  NAVICP will be an integral part of this approach to PBL, and will play critical roles in contract development and execution of supply chain requirements. NAVAIR, NAVICP and the PSI will operate within a long-term, performance-based contract structure using performance metrics and strong incentives aligned to meet Warfighter needs. Performance-based agreements (PBAs) between PMA-275 and both Warfighters documenting user support needs and Fleet performance metrics are provided as Attachments A and B.  Detailed PSI responsibilities are contained in Attachment C.  Respondents are expected to describe capabilities and demonstrated experience, which would support successful execution of these responsibilities.

Integrated Data Systems:  Implementation of this PBL concept will require near-real-time technical, logistics and programmatic data management capability using an integrated information technology network.  The PSI must have the capability to interface with both Navy and Air Force logistics information systems and databases. Also, the PSI’s financial systems must be capable of managing cost performance matrices involving multiple appropriations and Service-unique requirements. Additionally, these systems must be able to link and report expenditures to various funding sources. 


Aircraft Basing Concept:  Basing assignment of  the 50 CV-22 and 360 MV-22 aircraft is planned as follows:  CV-22 aircraft are currently projected for four bases - two CONUS, Kirtland AFB and Hurlburt Field, and two OCONUS bases in EUCOM and PACOM. MV-22 aircraft will be based at three CONUS bases - MCAS New River, MCAS Miramar and MCAS Pendleton, two OCONUS bases and sea bases as required. Basing assignment is subject to change. Both Services will require the PSI to be capable of providing worldwide support to CONUS and OCONUS fixed-base and deployed locations including supporting shipboard operations.

Foreign Military Sales:  The PBL contract will be constructed to facilitate the future incorporation of Foreign Military Sales customer support requirements, to include supply chain management, technical data and sustaining engineering. The PSI must be capable of supporting FMS, as well as domestic, customer requirements 

AIRSpeed :  The PSI should be capable of participating as a partner with NAVAIR and naval aviation maintenance activities in productivity improvement initiatives exemplified by the AIRSpeed program.  

Contract Type:  An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity task order type contract is anticipated for both the initial and follow-on contracts.  It is anticipated that, throughout the term of the initial PBL contract, various CLINs within the contract will carry differing contract types suited to the scope, predictability, variability, and risk associated with the work to be performed under that CLIN.  Contract incentives will be targeted to motivate specific contractor performance, which supports short- and long-term Warfighter objectives described in the PBAs. Industry is reminded that the Navy discourages exclusive teaming arrangements that inhibit competition (NAVAIR 5252.215-9505). Additionally, the PBL contract will require and incentivize the PSI to actively look for opportunities to engage small, small disadvantaged, women owned, veteran owned, and HUB zoned businesses, along with Historically Black Colleges and Universities in performing work under the PBL contract.  


Responses:  NAVAIR requests that companies respond by submitting a plan for a PBL approach for the program in whole and/or in individual areas of interest, to include examples of previous logistic support efforts, along with any other related information. Submissions are limited to 50 double-spaced printed pages including attachments and one printed and one electronic copy must be submitted to NAVAIR.  Emailed submissions will not be accepted by NAVAIR.  Copies of the PBAs and Product Support Integrator Responsibilities will be posted to the NAVAIR web site http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/.  The Government will not reimburse any preparation costs. Submissions will not be returned.  Interested parties responding in writing may be given an opportunity, after review of their written response, to provide a presentation on their PBL plan.  The presentation will be limited to an hour and 15 minutes, 45 minutes for presentation and 30 minutes for questions.  Presentations will be schedule after submission review.

<DESC>Purpose:  The United States Navy seeks to identify potential sources to perform as the single Product Support Integrator (PSI) for sustaining the Navy/Marine Corp and US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) V-22 aircraft variants.  

Program Description:  The MV-22 aircraft will replace the existing Marine Corps CH-46 and CH-53D helicopters.  The CV 22 aircraft will provide the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) a tilt-rotor aircraft capable of performing  long-range Special Operations Forces (SOF) missions.  The CV-22 retains 88 percent airframe, 100 percent propulsion, and 23 percent avionics commonality with the MV-22.  The program of record includes 360 MV-22 and 50 CV-22 aircraft and an additional 48 HV-22 Fleet Logistics Support, Aerial Refueling and Special Warfare variants. 

Government’s Intent:  The V-22 Program Office (PMA –275) is pursuing a systems-level performance based logistics (PBL) strategy to meet sustainment requirements for MV-22 and CV-22 users.  The intent is to create a sustainment support structure that is comprehensive, responsive to Warfighter requirements and affordable. The Navy’s intent is that the first long-term sustainment PBL contract will be awarded no later than June 2008. The planned length of the initial PBL contract is five years.   

Scope:  Under this PBL, the PSI will share authority, responsibility and risk with the Government for sustainment efficiency and effectiveness.

The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), a wholly-owned Federal Government Corporation, intends to award a contract to a qualified vendor who can provide physical examinations for AmeriCorps*NCCC, a residential national service program operated by the CNCS.  The AmeriCorps*NCCC engages young people ages 18 – 24 in team based service on projects in local communities throughout designated regions of the country.  The Central Region Campus is located at 3001 South Federal Blvd., Denver, Colorado and serves local community projects, as well as projects in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana and Michigan.  In case of disaster relief (i.e. Gulf Region hurricanes, forest fires), members may be sent to other state locations. 

During January 3, 2006 approximately 33 Team Leaders and on January 23, 2006, 260 Corps Members will arrive on the Central Region Campus with the understanding that each will have to take a physical examination similar to a pre-employment screening upon program entry.  Our program is rigorous with several essential work functions that make it imperative to assess each member’s fitness to perform safely in the program. Therefore, a health care provider is needed to conduct a physical examination on each member.

The physical exams will be conducted during two phases and includes several component parts in addition to a 10 panel drug test, “PPD testing” for tuberculosis and tetanus shots. 
 
Phase I - On January 3, 2006, 33 Team Leaders arrive on campus.  We would like to arrange for a physical examination at the provider’s facility on Wednesday, January 4, 2006, 1:30 pm to 5:00 pm.

Phase II - On January 23, 2006 additional members arrive on campus.  We would like to have the physical and drug testing to be done at the medical provider’s facility (one location).  Would like to schedule 65 members each day for 4 days, January 25, January 26 January 27 and January 28, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. We are requesting sufficient medical personnel be provided to insure the adequate, timely processing of approximately 65 members within a 8 hour day.  If some of the examination requirements cannot be provided on-site, the provider may submit alternatives for completing all requirements.

•	In addition, we require the results of the drug testing within 24 hours of the last test. TB PPD skin tests are to be read within 48-72 hours following the application. Medically trained personnel will read and evaluate the members TB skin results.

If Corps Members have medical conditions considered dangerous to their health if left untreated (e.g. previously unknown glucosuria or proteinuria, hypertension, possibility of malignancy, or any other defect that may jeopardize the Corps Member’s health), physicians will inform them orally of the problem and advise them to seek medical attention. The physician will document the findings and notify the NCCC staff liaison.

The requirements of the provider to perform the physical examination process are as follows: 
All medical providers (Doctors (M.D.s, D.O.s); Physician Assistants; Nurse Practitioners) performing or overseeing the performance of the physical examinations must have current, appropriate professional licenses to perform medical and other related services.

If Certified Physician Assistants and/or Certified Nurse Practitioners are utilized, an Internal Medicine Physician and/or Family Practitioner must also be on the premises performing or overseeing the performance of the medical examinations.

When the examining physician is of the opposite sex or when a member requests it, same-sex chaperones must be provided (there are significantly more female members than males – it is important that a sufficient number of female chaperones be made available).
 
A.	THE SCOPE OF THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS: 
    
•	A medical provider in a private one-on-one session will examine the mouth, eyes, lymph nodes, lungs, heart, breasts (females only), abdomen, and/or inguinal hernia/testicular exam (males only) of each member.

•	Dental review  (determine acceptability only)

•	Urine-albumin and sugar (reagent strips)

Tuberculosis test (PPD), chest x-ray with positive PPD

•	Physician recommendations for follow-up, as needed.


B.  DOCUMENTATION OF FINDINGS:

•	Provider’s physicians and technicians will document all findings on an agreed upon medical form that will be in the members medical chart to address the component parts of the physical examinations.

•	The physician will document if the examined member has any abnormalities that may preclude him/her from participating in rigorous physical activity and/or performing in the AmeriCorps*NCCC program.   

•	The provider will give the documented charts to AmeriCorps*NCCC Personnel, identified as the AmeriCorps*NCCC Liaison.  

C.	OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PROVIDER  

•	To review the AmeriCorps Medical/Mental Health Information Form on all members prior to the examination.  

•	To follow the prescribed Physical Examination for AmeriCorps*NCCC members.  The physical exam elements will not exceed those mentioned in the scope of work and be consistent for both the team leaders and members.  

•	To ensure injured or acutely ill members receive emergency medical treatment in the event of such emergency during their course of stay at the vendor’s facility, if the exams are not conducted on campus.  After applying measures necessary to sustain life and to reduce the possibility of further injury, the providers’ staff will, if necessary, call an ambulance.  All such cases will be reported immediately to the AmeriCorps*NCCC Liaison. 


 
D.	EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES AND FACILITIES:   

•	The provider will provide all equipment and supplies necessary to perform all services (including patient gowns and drapes).  Regardless of where the physical exam is held, member privacy must be maintained and adequate space must be provided in the performance of all services.

E.	THIRD PARTIES:  

•	It is recognized that some services such as laboratory testing for drug screens may be sub-contracted out by the contractor.  All sub-contracted facilities must be properly credentialed to provide the service. The contractor must include all costs associated with third party examination requirements. 
 
F.	RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTIES:

There will be two parties to carry out the terms of this procurement.  The parties are:  The medical provider and AmeriCorps*NCCC.

0001	Kevlar Combat Helmets (Level IIIA)	11,891	
        Green or Woodland Camouflage with Chin Strap

***  Helmets MUST meet NIJ Level IIIA specifications IAW NIJ Standard 0106.01 and meet MIL-STD-662E requirements.  NIJ Approved Laboratory V50 testing certificates documenting NIJ Level IIIA compliance must be submitted with proposals.  ANY OFFEROR WHO FAILS TO MEET SPECIFICATIONS OR PROVIDE COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION WILL BE DEEMED UNRESPONSIVE AND REMOVED FROM FURTHER CONSIDERATION.

Solicitation will be posted to FBO on 16 Dec 05. 

All quotes should be submitted to robert.brooks@pco-iraq.net

Preferred method of submission is email attachment.  Unable to receive faxes.


Q:  1.  will you budge on accepting options?  I can provide you an excellent price but slower delivery or a relatively good price with NEXT DAY delivery.  I would like to provide you both prices as options.
 A:  Options are acceptable if clearly spelled out…

Q:  2.  also, for terms of payment:  for this type of item, can we request payment of 50% on first delivery or is the government set to NET 30
A:  Progress payments authorized only on what is delivered and invoiced…

Q:  I am writing to ask if it is possible to get a 2-3 day extension on submitting proposals for W9GY0-06-Q-0043. 
A:  The solicitation states 22 Dec 1630 Baghdad…the synopsis states 23 Dec…to avoid ambiguity, the final acceptance of solicitations will be 1630 Baghdad on 23 Dec…

Q:  Is it correct to assume that the EUC will take 45 days to be issued for the Kevlar Helmets as it did for the APC?
A:  If you are shipping outside the US and need an EUC, it should only take a couple of weeks…

Q:  
A:  Helmets do require EUCs if the exporting country says they are required.  Items coming from the U.S. are covered by a blanket EUC known as the “505 plus” agreement between the U.S. and Iraq.  Exporters are still required to submit to the State Department its Form DSP-83 but the Iraqi signatures may be omitted.  A copy of the 505 plus should be attached and is available from me on request.  
Generally I tell vendors to expect a 21-day turnaround on EUCs.  This may be longer but is often shorter.  Turnaround is dependent on the availability of approved signatories and convoy support to the related ministries.  Mr. Mushriqui should note that the expected turnaround is from the date that I receive correct information.  

Q:  Where can we obtain a copy of the drawings and specifications for the Kevlar Combat Helmets requested as part of Solicitation # W9GY0-06-Q-0043?  We would appreciate it if you could let us know.
A:  It’s a commercial product…

Q:  Will these helmets be for US army use?
A:  The Government will use the helmets as needed…the solicitation, evaluation and award has no bearing on what the intended purpose is…

 Q:  I’ve waiting on some clarification on my quote before I submit my proposal, but I did notice a discrepancy on the solicitation.  All of the modifications, to include the synopsis, have a response date of the 23rd.  To this deadline I based my timeline for submission.  I just now noticed that the solicitation has date of the 22nd.  If I turn it in by 1630 on the 23rd, am I considered non-responsive even though I met the timeline that is on the synopsis and all 7 modifications?  
A:  Solicitation asked for 22 Dec 1630 Baghdad…it is posted after the synopsis…no different than revised proposals…
\I do not intend to argue over ambiguities…23 Dec will be acceptable and considered responsive, although not in accordance with the solicitation and all amendments…

Q:  We intend to submit a bid for the RFQ specified in the subject line.
The product we have meets "NIJ Level IIIA" testing requirements.
However, the material used for this helmet is not Kevlar.
Would it be acceptable to supply helmets that is not made of Kevlar but
other fibers that meets the NIJ IIIA testings.
A:  The solicitation specifically calls for Kevlar...

OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the  OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government.

The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005.

NOTE: The CO Finding  letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for  XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ************************************************************************  Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting  Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant concern for  successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services  contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to reflect  this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the  OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government. The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and  the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming  competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require offerors to  submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services that  involve a high level of complex skill sets. The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to  provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any  proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the  Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated  Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best  Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone  award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a  tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the  next two weeks. The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days  to late Sept 2005. Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP.  Release of the formal RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with  proposals due early Jan 06. Award is contemplated late April 06.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health is doing a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of Hubzone, Service-disabled veteran owned, 8(a), and small businesses to provide services to the Office of AIDS Research (OAR).  The OAR intends to recompete a contract to provide services that support the programs of the office.  The OAR is responsible for the scientific planning, budgetary, legislative, and policy elements of the NIH AIDS research program.  OAR promotes collaborative research in both national and international settings and is responsible for the development of an annual comprehensive plan and budget for all NIH AIDS research.  OAR supports’ trans-NIH Coordinating Committees to advance these efforts in the following areas of program emphasis: Natural History and Epidemiology; Etiology and Pathogenesis; Therapeutics; Vaccines; Behavioral and Social Science; Racial and Ethnic Minorities; Training, Infrastructure, and Capacity Building; and Information Dissemination.  Services that will be required through this procurement will include, but are not limited to: A) Writing, Editorial, Production, and Document Preparation Support for large documents, visual aids, meeting materials, exhibits, and other products, most often on a quick turnaround basis.  Current and thorough knowledge of the science of AIDS, the NIH AIDS research program, and the activities of OAR are required. B) Technical Information Systems Support for electronic communications and dissemination of information using the Internet or other technology.  The Offeror will have the capability to design and maintain web sites, information kiosks, and other electronic media.  Collection and maintenance of information resources in an automated manner will be required, as will the development of an easy-to-use database system for tracking information on people and events.  Software support and training capabilities are sometimes required. Successful demonstration of the capability to bring all the skills necessary to satellite broadcast an event from an international location to several sites must be presented.  The Offeror shall also have the capability to produce videos from concept through all phases of production through distribution.  C) Analysis Support for literature searches, analysis/synthesis of data, drafting issues papers on topics from science to policy, development of strategies for information dissemination, and program evaluation.  D) National and International Meeting and Conference Support from planning, budgeting, identification of presenters and participants, agenda development, logistical arrangements, travel and expense reimbursement, contract negotiations, development and dissemination of briefing materials, onsite materials, and post meeting information, correspondence and tracking and production of documentation.  Due to the levels of funding and staffing, the requirement to have relevant experience working with high profile individuals and subject matter, the requirements for quick response and error-free deliverables, special requirements have been established for potential offerors.  Many of the activities and services for OAR are integrated so any teaming arrangements must demonstrate how the staffing will appear seamless to OAR. The special requirements include: 1)To assure rapid response to changing program needs and to assure adequate day-to-day management of multiple complex activities that must be conducted in close concert with activities of OAR staff, other NIH institutes or Federal agencies, and other contractors, the project staff of the successful Offeror (and subcontractors, if any) must be available to meet with OAR program staff in Bethesda, Maryland, with as little as 2 hours’ advance notice. Such meetings on any given day will involve one or more members of the Offeror's team representing different areas of service.  2)The Offeror shall have sufficient staff so that the Project Officer can develop a long-term working relationship with the same individual or individuals over the life of the contract to maintain continuity in the delivery of services.  The available staff must be extensive and flexible enough to staff up to 43 FTEs in one month and then cut back to 8 FTEs a few months later to accommodate fluctuations in work volume and type.  There must be an adequate depth of staff to allow projects to be staffed and begin without delay.  It is important that the Offeror have a plan for maintaining trained staff with experience working with the OAR that can be accessible when required, but not be billable to the project during periods of minimal activity.  3) The Offeror will assist, often under tight deadlines, with the development of issue papers, briefing books, research papers, summary reports, etc., regarding the mission of the OAR, programs underway, budget, and other substantive issues.  Analytical and editorial staff must have a thorough knowledge of HIV/AIDS research issues and familiarity with resources for quickly compiling current data.  The Offeror must have a plan for making individuals with this knowledge available upon very short notice.  4) OAR is a top-level, policy making office in which NIH staff work under considerable pressure to carry out the office’s mission through its various programs and activities, as well as respond to high level requests for information regarding the AIDS research program at NIH.  The Director is frequently called on to make presentations or give testimony to Congress regarding budget appropriations for AIDS research or to discuss progress being made in the NIH AIDS research program.  These activities challenge OAR program staff to efficiently assemble appropriate data for presentations.  Schedules that are set up are nonnegotiable, frequently with stringent deadlines.  Offeror staff must be prepared to react competently to these quick turnaround requirements by compiling documentation into briefing books, summary reports, presentation materials, etc.  The Offeror must be able to interact efficiently with OAR staff and quickly turn around materials that will not be able to be able to go back and forth by fax or electronic copy for review and revision cycles (e.g., enlargements, color, visual aids, final copies, etc.).  The Offeror should have adequate facilities, with back up staff and equipment, to produce materials, often overnight, without delay. A Offeror location within close proximity of the NIH campus facilitates communication and work flow, maximizes Offeror and client resources, and conserves costs.  5) OAR serves as the lead agency representing NIH’s AIDS research effort nationally and internationally so its documents and communications are distributed widely with target audiences including the Congress of the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services, other Executive Branch Departments, the medical and scientific research communities and the public.  All materials and services delivered to OAR must be provided in a timely and accurate manner and all materials leaving OAR must be error-free and received by the proper audiences.  Offeror staff will interact with individuals from the highest levels of the U.S. and foreign governments, community groups and advocates, scientists and medical professionals and HIV+ individuals regarding highly sensitive subject matter.  Offerors must demonstrate experience working in a highly sensitive and confidential environment successfully.  6) The Offeror must have experience working throughout the United States and internationally.  Offeror staff may be called upon to work with VIPs from the U.S. and other countries.  The Offeror should demonstrate experience with high level arrangements including briefings on protocol and cultural issues, security, required documentation, etc.  7) The Offeror shall demonstrate knowledge and understanding of travel arrangements and requirements in and out of the United States according to the Federal Travel Regulations.  8) The Offeror will be required to make payments, upon approval of the Project Officer, to organizers of collaborative or supported events; to pay vendors for products and services required for conferences or other activities and to reimburse meeting participants for expenses and honoraria.  Offerors must demonstrate the ability to make payments without delay and expend as much as $4 million over a 2 month period under standard reimbursement procedures from the Government.  Firms responding to this market survey should respond to each of the 8 special requirements demonstrating not potential capability, but proven successful experiences.  Responses should be concise with only the pertinent information requested.  If subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to meet the requirements, the prime contractor must demonstrate the ability to deliver the technical capabilities and maintain adequate labor, management and financial control of the project. 

The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS Code 56110 size standard $6.5 million. This market survey is being conducted through the FedBizOpps to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information. Responding firms shall provide two (2) copies of their tailored capability statement to Marcia Goldman, Office of Logistics and Acquisition Operations,6011 Executive Blvd.,  Room 539A , Bethesda,  Maryland  20892-7633.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Research Services (ORS), is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of contractors to provide services for the development and implementation of a comprehensive Integrated Pest Management Program (IPMP).     This requirement is for the development of a comprehensive Integrated Pest Management Program (IPMP) and the implementation of integrated pest management services that will meet AAALAC accreditation requirements.  The IPMP must provide service to all NIH animal facilities.  Technical expertise is an essential component of the IPMP, and is required to provide routine and emergency consultation with NIH personnel, to resolve pest management problems, and direct day-to-day pest management operations.  The IPMP shall be proactive in design and performance.  This is to minimize the need for a "crisis response" to pest outbreaks, and to maximize cooperation and program effectiveness.  The IPMP is an integral part of the safety programs at the NIH and the Department of Health and Human Services.  The IPMP must reflect an emphasis on the reduction and long term control of pests without jeopardizing research or compromising the health and safety of the patients, NIH personnel, or visitors, and research animals by unnecessarily exposing them to pesticides.  Therefore, only the most current and effective pest management practices are to be utilized in the IPMP.  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, supplies, equipment, supervision, and transportation for the development and implementation of a comprehensive Integrated Pest Management Program for designated animal care facilities and associated support facilities of the National Institutes of Health.
The contractor shall have an understanding of the concept of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) method of pest control as it is applied in sensitive animal research environments.  IPM is a process that encompasses making accurate decisions as to when pest control measures are needed, the type of control measure(s) to be used, and the method of application.   Management practices in an IPM program are not based on the routine application of pesticides, but on thorough inspections, monitoring for pests, collecting and evaluating data, identifying sanitation deficiencies, modifying structures, and performing and documenting ongoing training for both the pest management contractor and NIH personnel.  This shall include the collection and management of pest control data, generation of required reports, and distribution of those reports.  The contractor shall have an understanding of the principles and practices of sanitation in sensitive animal research facilities and the effects of pests and pest management methods on the occupants.  The contractor shall have a Pesticide Business License, from the Maryland Department of Agriculture in Category VII Industrial, Institutional, and Health Related Pest Control with Sub-categories - (A.) General; (B.) Termite; (C.) Bird; (D.) Rodent, and (E.) Industrial Weed.  The contractor shall demonstrate any special qualifications and experience in conducting pest management programs in sensitive animal care facilities, Biological Safety Level 2 and 3 laboratories, and other similar facilities. The contractor shall be able to meet all current and future requirements of this contract regarding personnel, time commitments, and logistical and technical support and shall adhere to all applicable local, State, and Federal regulations.  The Contractor will be required to provide an approach for the development of IPM programs, service schedules, pest management monitoring, surveying and quality assurance.     The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS Code 561710 with a size standard of $6 Million.     The period of performance shall be for one 12-month base year with four 12-month option periods from date of award.     

If your organization is potentially capable in performing these services, please provide the following information:     1) Organization name, address, email address, website address and telephone number as well as size and type of ownership for the organization (i.e., small business, small disadvantage business, 8(a), woman-owned, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), and Veteran and/or Service-disabled Veteran); 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability; and 3) Number of facilities managed.     Firms responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused pertinent information is requested.     

RESPONDING FIRMS SHOULD PROVIDE TWO COPIES OF THE CAPABILITY STATEMENT BY January 6, 2006 AT 2:00 PM LOCAL TIME and mail to Terita R. Stevenson, 6011 Executive Boulevard, Room 539-C, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7663.     (NOTE:     If you are using a courier service, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail, the city, state, and zip code should read ROCKVILLE, MD 20852).         

This market survey is being conducted through Find Business Opportunities to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information.     The Government has the right to set aside this procurement exclusively for  8(a) or small business participation as the result of this market survey.  By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database (Registration is available via the Internet at www.CCR.gov) prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.

This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis in support of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Center for Beneficiary Choices (CBC).  The CMS is seeking sources to perform collection and management services of the annual Medicare Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems surveys.   This requirement will include data collection and data management of the Medicare Advantage (MA), Medicare Fee-For-Service (MFFS), Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (MA-PDP), and Medicare Stand Alone PDP (PDP) CAHPS surveys.   

The Contractors are required to have specialized capabilities in the data collection and management of large national annual surveys with complex survey designs and the development and management of data files that will permit CMS and other CMS contractors to develop quality of care performance measures for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries on an annual basis.  CMS has sponsored the Medicare CAHPS surveys annually in Medicare managed care, now Medicare Advantage (MA) health plans since 1998, and in the original Fee-For-Service (MFFS) Medicare program since 2000.   Performance measures from the CAHPS survey have been provided to beneficiaries on the Medicare.gov web site and in other publications available to the public on an annual basis.   

It is critical to CMS' mission to continue the collection and preparation of CAHPS data files used in the preparation of CAHPS performance measures and to expand these data collection and data file production efforts to include the Medicare health and PDP plans noted above.  The data will be used for the purposes of assisting beneficiaries to choose among the plans available to them, for use in quality improvement projects identified by CMS, as well as for providing proper oversight and management of the Medicare Program.    Potential contractors must show their capability to produce multiple data files from the data it collects in the Medicare CAHPS surveys that are compatible with the data analysis needs of the government and organizations that have successfully executed Data Use Agreements with CMS for these data files.   

Interested contractors must submit a capability statement to show their capability to put in place and maintain data security systems necessary for maintaining the strict confidentiality requirements of all CMS data obtained from CMS files, as well as all data collected under any potential contracts.

The Contractor must show capability to implement data collection strategies using sample files and protocols provided to them by CMS to efficiently produce CAHPS data files from the data collection efforts of the Medicare CAHPS surveys on a tight annual schedule.  The survey samples will be provided to the Contractor by CMS.  The Contractor must show capability of implementing the Medicare CAHPS Surveys in all Medicare health plans and Medicare PDP plans as defined above, across all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands.  Data collection efforts, both mail and telephone follow-up will be conducted using survey questionnaires provided to the Contractor in both English and Spanish languages.   Formatting and layout of hard copy questionnaire forms must be designed for scannable input of all returned completed forms with photocopying of each completed page for electronic storage and retrieval.     The Contractor must also develop a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview version for each of the Medicare CAHPS surveys and demonstrate the capability to hire and train telephone interviewers to implement the follow-up portion of the surveys in both English and Spanish.

In addition to collecting the CAHPS data and providing CMS with the data files resulting from these data collection efforts, the Contractor must facilitate and provide technical support and assistance to CMS and other CMS contractors,  who will use the collected data in production of Medicare CAHPS performance measures and other data analyses .  While these analyses will be the responsibility of CMS and other contractors to CMS, the CAHPS data collection and management Contractor must be prepared to coordinate its production of data files to appropriately meet the analytic needs of CMS and the CMS contractors charged with producing CAHPS performance measures and data analyses.   The data collection and management Contractor must demonstrate the experience and capability to provide this type of technical assistance to analysts using compatible data software in similarly large and multiple data files, and to multiple clients, on a timely basis.     

PLEASE NOTE:  Any potential offeror must demonstrate the following:

<DESC>The Air Vehicles Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory conducted focused research in rapid-response space-lift by producing liquid oxygen in an airborne vehicle.  The proposed contract action will continue this research to include cryogenic fluid testing in a Rotating Fractional Distillation Unit (RFDU).  This testing effort will consist of four major subtasks.  The first is to perform modifications required to convert the high g test rig (HigRig) incorporating the structured packing test article to cryogenic testing.  The second is to design, procure, and assemble all the necessary components to feed cryogenic fluids to the HigRig, vent the exhaust, and take the necessary test data.  The third task is to actually perform the high g tests under cryogenic fluid flow conditions, using the test plan and procedures refined during previous room temperature testing.  Finally, in the fourth task, data from testing is used to refine all-up RFDU models and predict performance of a full sized unit.  No Government Property is available for this effort.  The government does not own any test plans, procedures, or analytical models from earlier research efforts.

NOTE: This notice is for informational purposes only.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Contractors capable of offering this technology must respond within 15 days after publication of this notice and will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NATIONAL CHILD CARE INFORMATION AND TRAINING RESOURCE CENTER
SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE

PURPOSE

The purpose of this SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) that can provide operation of the National Child Care Information and Technical Assistance Center (known as NCCIC) on behalf of the Child Care Bureau, Administration for Children and Families within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  

BACKGROUND

The Child Care Bureau (CCB) is responsible for administering the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) to help working low-income families achieve and maintain economic self-sufficiency, and to improve the overall quality of child care.  The CCB is dedicated to promoting parental choice while enhancing the quality, affordability, and supply of child care services available for all families.  Through its administration of the CCDF to States, Territories, and Tribes, the CCB assists low-income families to access quality child care that promotes safe and healthy environments and supports children’s physical, social-emotional, and cognitive development while parents are at work or participating in education or training that will enhance their employability.

The CCB established the National Child Care Information Center (NCCIC) in October 1994 for the purpose of providing comprehensive child care information resources and technical assistance services to CCDF Grantees and other child care stakeholders.  The name of the Center is being changed in 2006 to the “National Child Care Information and Technical Assistance Center” (NCCIC) to more accurately describe the breath and scope of the Center’s responsibilities.  Today NCCIC is the largest national operation providing both on-site consulting to States and comprehensive child care information resources through a variety of media including Child Care Bulletins, briefs, and other original publications; and technical assistance services for State child care operations.  The NCCIC provides a comprehensive child care web site with thousands of pages of child care related information, including an on-line library, annotated bibliographies, and resource lists related to scores of child care topics.  In addition, NCCIC answers thousands of information requests annually via phone and email, along with hundreds of tailored requests to meet the needs of State CCDF grantees.  Finally, NCCIC maintains a network of technical assistance specialists with State CCDF experience which has a technical assistance relationship with each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Territories to provide on-site and distance consulting and facilitation on all matters of CCDF administration and early childhood services coordination at the State and local levels.

<SUBJECT>A -- An Adjustable roof Bracket and Safety Rail Assembly
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-2006-001
<RESPDATE>012506
<ARCHDATE>02092006
<CONTACT>Brenda Goodwin, Contract Specialist, Phone (304)285-5882, Fax (304)285-6083, Email bcg1@cdc.gov
<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is interested in partnering with a manufacturer of roofing products to evaluate the current version of a NIOSH-designed, patent-pending “adjustable roof bracket and safety rail assembly.”  Additionally, NIOSH requests that the cooperating roof-products manufacturer conduct a marketability analysis related to the current version of the bracket-rail assembly.  The goal of this collaboration will be to enhance the design of the current prototype bracket-rail assembly to enable the wide-spread usage of this safety product throughout the residential and commercial-industrial construction industries.  This announcement is a business opportunity in that the partner selected will share expertise with NIOSH researchers toward making the bracket-rail assembly a profitable, widely used safety product.  Currently, there are no commercially available roofing products that demonstrate the versatility of the NIOSH-designed bracket-safety rail assembly.  This assembly has been designed to protect construction and maintenance workers at a variety of residential, industrial, or commercial construction work sites.  The assembly is a guardrail system that can be installed around any type of hole in the floor or roof of a building during construction, on the surface of or along the edge of a wide range of roof pitches, and along other unprotected edges, such as balconies, decks, or stairwell openings.  Laboratory testing, which used a simulated roof work site, was conducted by the NIOSH research team and successfully demonstrated that the bracket-rail assembly met the requirements of the OSHA regulations related to worker fall protection (Subpart M).  Specifically, subsection 1926.502(b)(3) states that “Guardrail systems shall be capable of withstanding, without failure, a force of at least 200 pounds (890 N) applied within 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the top edge, in any outward or downward direction, any point along the top edge …”  Laboratory results have assisted the research team in developing improvements to the initial design.  Tests of the fourth generation of adjustable bracket-safety rail assembly have indicated that the system supported, without failure, a downward and outward force that far exceeds the requirement specified by the OSHA regulation cited above.  These results indicate that this assembly is a viable product that can be effective in potentially preventing hundreds of fatalities and thousands of severe injuries that result when workers fall from sloped roofs, through unguarded holes, or from unprotected edges.  Candidate companies, which appear to provide the most promise of meeting the requirements listed below, may be evaluated by their capability to complete the research and development needed to bring the adjustable bracket-safety rail assembly into commercial production.  NIOSH does not promise to sign a partnership agreement with any presented company.  While neither party promises to enter into a purchasing or testing agreement, the right is reserved to establish a partnership based on engineering analysis/evaluation capabilities found under this announcement or other searches, if determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  

Adjustable roof bracket-safety rail assembly Commercialization Capability Parameters:
(Companies should try to meet as many of these requirements as possible, but highly innovative solutions without testing are not discouraged from presentation or response.)

(A) Provide significant intellectual, engineering, and technical expertise in manufacturing the bracket-rail assembly.  This would include defining the cost and usability needs of a target residential or commercial-industrial construction industry.  Also, assistance will be provided to NIOSH for setting realistic product cost objectives and suggestions will be provided on how the bracket-rail assembly can achieve the product cost goals – Required;

(B) Fabricate prototypes for usability testing and evaluation during actual construction activities – Required;

(C) Provide expertise to NIOSH in designing and conducting workplace evaluations involving residential and commercial-industrial construction workers – Required;

(D) Review test results and recommend design modifications – Required;

(E) Review testing methods and recommend appropriate, substitute testing criteria – Required;

(F) Work with a client of the manufacturer to evaluate the following factors during actual construction activities – (1) ease or difficulty of user installation; (2) product durability throughout an entire construction season; (3) worker/management acceptance – Required.

	NIOSH is seeking an innovative partner to address these major areas.  A company that is qualified and currently producing roofing products for use in both residential and commercial-industrial construction industries is highly desirable.  However, past testing and design of roof safety products is not required.  If prior testing has been performed, the testing information and results should be provided.
	Interested parties responding to this request should provide detailed information regarding their manufacturing capabilities, test set-up and results, and information related to estimated costs to manufacture this product.  Presentation materials may consist of literature, electronic presentation, and/or video.  (Samples, information, and data provided to the Government as part of this solicitation will not be returned to vendors following the completion of this project.)  Vendors may be offered the opportunity to meet with the project team following a review of all submitted information.  Data, information, and product samples must be delivered to NIOSH within two weeks (10 business days) of the closing of this announcement.  Although every effort will be made to consider all information received, the Government will not be obligated to evaluate information received after the two-week period.  Vendors should note any proprietary data as such.  If any data is to be excluded from exchange with any of the project participants, a statement of that fact shall be included with the “statement of propriety.”  Presentations from interested vendors are optional but encouraged.  The Government has identified March 7, 8 & 9, 2006 for these presentations to be conducted.  The Government reserves the right to identify an alternate meeting date if those specified are not viable for one or more interested vendors.  Please send literature to and coordinate presentations directly with:  Thomas G. Bobick, Project Officer, CDC/NIOSH, Mailstop H-G800, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505; phone 304-285-5986; fax 304-285-6047; e-mail txb4@cdc.gov.  Please include 3 copies of all documents submitted.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Communications at Speed and Depth for U.S. Navy Submarines
<SOLNBR>SPAWAR_Headquarters_MKTSVY_327B2
<RESPDATE>012606
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Karen Rainville, Contract Specialist,  858-537-0423
<DESC>1.0 DESCRIPTION 1.1 The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) is seeking sources for the potential development and production of Communications at Speed & Depth (CSD) capabilities for U.S. Navy submarines.  This capability will provide communications with submarines while they are submerged at normal operating depths and traveling at speeds required to perform tactical operations. CSD extends the FORCEnet construct to stealthy undersea Navy platforms with the purpose of increasing the effectiveness of these platforms in achieving the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) SEAPOWER 21 vision.  Currently, the Navy is interested in the development and/or production of a Family of Systems including Buoyant Cable Antennas, Tethered Expendable Communications Buoys, Untethered Expendable Communications Buoys, Undersea Acoustic/Radio Frequency Communications Buoys, Recoverable Tethered Communication Buoys, and Distributed Undersea Communications Networks. 1.1.1 A Buoyant Cable Antenna (BCA) is a 1500-foot long, 0.65-inch diameter, polyurethane wrapped antenna that is sail mounted on all submarines in the U.S. inventory.  It is deployed and retrieved as necessary to receive low data rate ELF to VHF communications.  The system is capable of being deployed throughout a majority of a submarineâ€™s speed/depth range.  For the purposes of CSD, the Navy is seeking an upgrade to the current BCA, enabling the ability to receive and transmit HF communications, as well as the potential option of adding the ability to receive SATCOM communications. 1.1.2 The Untethered Expendable Communications Buoy (UECB) system is a one-way, expendable, 3-inch signal ejector launched, satellite communications buoy (utilizing Commercial Iridium Satellite Communications), which transmits data stored in memory prior to launch.  The UECB provides the required IP data connectivity using a low cost commercial Iridium satellite transceiver and a commercial standard data interface.  The system will be employed at slow to medium speeds and at all operational depths. Transmission can be delayed for up to four hours after launch to minimize submarine detection and localization. After transmission, the buoy will erase its memory and scuttle itself. 1.1.3 The Tethered Expendable Communications Buoy (TECB will be a two-way, expendable, fiber optic tether, 3-inch signal ejector launched, IP Satellite communications buoy that utilizes the commercial Iridium satellite communications network.  This system will provide two-way IP connectivity at 2.4 kbps over a broad submarine speed and depth envelope for a period of 10 to 30 minutes after the buoy is launched.  The fiber optic tether will allow for the buoy to transmit and receive data and then relay it down to a slow moving submarine, providing real-time data transfer with a submerged operating submarine. 1.1.4 The Tactical Paging Buoy is an Acoustic / RF Gateway that will be a persistent means of paging a submerged submarine.  A submarine, an aircraft, or a ship would deploy the TPB.  TPB acts as placed communications doorway, receiving RF signals, and transforming the signal into an acoustic transmission that a submarine would be able to pick up via the sonarâ€™s hydrophones.  Initial production would be one-way, acting as a â€œdoorbellâ€ signaling the Submarine to come up on a communications posture.  Spiral development would eventually allow for two-way communications between the submarine and the aircraft with the refinement and development of improved hydrophones and software. The aircraft deployed variant will be required to fit within a standard sonobuoy slot on U.S. aircraft. 1.1.5 The Recoverable Tethered Communications Buoys will offer better performance capability than an expendable buoy and significant potential for flexibility regarding communication payloads that could be used. In addition the buoy could accommodate surveillance payloads, which may have significant value in some operations.  The Recoverable Tether Communications Buoy has the potential to replace the AN/BRR-6. 1.1.6 Distributed Undersea Communications Network is a large field of undersea acoustic communication nodes can be used to create an undersea communications network suitable for submarines, UUVs, SEAL delivery vehicles, and battery- powered off-board sensors.  The Distributed Undersea Communications Network is a part of the SeaWeb experiment. 1.2 It is anticipated that Lead System Integrator (LSI) concepts may be utilized for this effort either at the FoS level or at the functional domain level (e.g., Buoyant Cable Antennas or Expendable Communications Buoys). The scope of integration includes segments such as launcher or deployment equipment hardware and interfaces, system control software, and shore site hardware/software integration (if applicable). Interested parties shall take this into consideration when providing responses to this synopsis. 2.0 SYNPOSIS TERMS - THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY.

<DESC>This is a market survey and sources sought synopsis to identify firms with expertise in providing Automated Point of Care Technology such as bar-code enabled or other commercially available automated solutions supporting numerous aspects of hospital- based patient care.  Industry responses will aid in the understanding and development of the Government’s functional and technical requirements by identifying capabilities and functionality of commercially available systems. The health care industry has identified human factors as a key element in the misidentification of patients, materials or medications, delivery of the wrong service to the wrong patient, and inefficient tracking of patients and materials in the hospital setting.  The Government believes that well designed and successfully implemented automated systems can provide significant improvements in patient safety by eliminating manual steps that are error prone due to human factors.  The Government’s object is to identify sources capable of providing Automated Point of Care Technology system that helps to ensure that critical patient care services are delivered with the greatest possible accuracy, efficiency and safety.  The Automated Point of Care Technology should have the ability to address the following three broad goals which will be applied to hospital-wide processes involved in specimen collection; blood administration; medication administration; nursing workflow; and tracking processes.  1.  Prevent misidentification errors through Accurate identification of patients; and Accurate identification of medications; blood products; medical records; lab specimens; medical equipment; medical supplies; and staff.  2.  Facilitate automation of workflow processes and tracking systems by Tracking of patient movement throughout the hospital; Tracking of paper medical record charts location in the hospital; Documentation of medical supplies and equipment used in the course of patient care; Tracking of medical equipment location in the hospital; and Electronically capturing data from general patient monitoring equipment such as vital sign monitors and infusion pumps.  3.  Facilitate real-time electronic verification and clinical documentation steps through Verification of correct product and or procedures at point of care as per medical order (medications, blood products, specimen collection, diagnostic procedures, therapeutic procedures, ancillary services); and Verification of correct medical record at the time of clinical documentation. The NIH Clinical Center’s requirement is for the following:  A wireless Barcode Enabled Point of Care System that is compatible with the networking and technology capabilities available in the NIH Clinical Center.

<DESC>Under the US ARMY's Integrated Emergency Operations Center (IEOC) Program, The Department of the ARMY, ARDEC, solicits information from potential industry  partners to collaborate in the technology of software products (e.g. Commercial  off-the-shelf and developmental items) for crisis management to support  Homeland Defense/Homeland Security emergency operations.  Commercial off-the- shelf is meant in this context as a product that has a reasonable number of  commercial sales in the past year and is readily available on the commercial  market and could be immediately deployed.  Developmental items are running  prototypes that could be considered for future needs as they mature.  The  general applications are any and all functions engaged in response to natural  or man-made emergencies. For background to potential responders, the mission of the IEOC program is to  develop and demonstrate a regionally based "Integrated Emergency Operation  Center" (IEOC) to allow all levels of the National Infrastructure to train,  intervene, and respond to man-made or natural disasters.  At the highest level,  the goal is to provide the tools and techniques necessary to train for an event  by scripting and reviewing disaster events that prompt a response.  On the  operational response side, the program seeks to provide best-of-breed  collaborative tools, interoperable equipment to support voice, video and data  connectivity from the incident scene to the incident commander through the IEOC  thus providing for seamless communications among all incident stakeholders. One  of the specific deliverables under the IEOC Program is to assess "candidate  software and hardware systems and to exercise the representative IEOC  architecture in various modes and scenarios relevant to the National Incident  Management System (NIMS) standard".  It is intended that testing and evaluation under this announcement will be  conducted jointly by the offerors and Government personnel or Government  contractors at the Integrated Emergency Operations Center (IEOC) in Johnstown,  Pennsylvania and/or the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at US Army ARDEC,  Picatinny, New Jersey.  Both locations support PC-based systems with Microsoft  operating systems and related software.  Special requirement for tests (e.g. a  particular relational database product) will have to be provided by the  industry collaborator to facilitate testing.  Selection of industry partners  will be wholly based upon the offeror's belief that they can address all or  part of the requirements specified.  The partner's software will be evaluated  against a "benchmark" requirements document as well as the partner's own  published capabilities specification.  This represents what the Government  anticipates as the first phase of collaboration. It is ARDEC's intent to  publish the testing results against the requirements baseline and partner's  published software capabilities specification after discussion and review with  the industry partner. A potential second collaborative phase may be considered if the Government and  industry partner find that the software product or product technology has more  wide ranging application to the Integrated Emergency Operations Center (IEOC)  Program. Once that decision is made, a contract arrangement or Cooperative  Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) may be considered appropriate.  A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable collaborations between the  government and industry.  It is not a grant, and it is not a contract for  procurement of goods/services.  The CRADA will result in no funds from ARDEC to  the collaborator. A second solicitation for actual industry partners will be issued on or about  Jan 30, 2006.  Concurrently, relevant documentation of requirements and an  outline of the testing process will be made available on a publicly accessible  web site. Letters of interest should include the following:  1.	a letter of intent from the potential industry partner  2.	a description of the software to be evaluated  3.	availability information on the proposed software PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE  GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION. Please also be advised that the Government  will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement. Responses  should be directed electronically to IEOC Program Manager, Mr. Robert Donnelly,  at donnelly@pica.army.mil.

1.0	OVERVIEW:  The US Coast Guard (USCG) operates twenty Falcon HU-25 aircraft.  Currently these aircraft are being externally stripped and painted at the Coast Guard’s Aircraft Repair and Supply Center following the completion of a required five year Programmed Depot Maintenance Inspection (PDM).  These aircraft have recently been experiencing paint adhesion discrepancies shortly after delivery to USCG operational units.  Paint adhesion contributes to increased field level maintenance and aircraft corrosion if left untreated.  These discrepancies can be attributed to the limited environmental controls of the paint facility.  In an effort to improve performance, reduce corrosion and field maintenance cost the Coast Guard intends to have one of its HU-25 aircraft commercially painted, for field evaluation, in April 2006.  This performance work statement (PWS) establishes the minimum external paint requirements for this aircraft.

2.0	SCOPE:  The USCG seeks Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized service centers in response to this performance work statement (PWS) and will select one vendor to prepare and externally paint one HU-25 aircraft in accordance with (IAW) commercial practices and manufacturer’s recommended procedures.  Contract award will be best value primarily linked to contractor’s submitted detailed work scope, facilities, quality system, past performance, process time and cost.  USCG cost evaluation will be based considering two criteria: 1) contractor’s quote to include at a minimum pre-paint preparation, and application of chromated epoxy primer and polyurethane topcoat as specified in this PWS.  2) USCG travel and roundtrip aircraft ferry cost from Elizabeth city, NC.  There is no intent to sacrifice quality for schedule.  Performance award clauses are associated with and described within this PWS.  The general scope of work is as follows:

2.1	Pre-paint surface preparation IAW commercial specifications.  Contractor to identify specification in the proposal.

(End of Clause)

Background:

The Section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amended by Section 110 (P.L. 99 499) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) is required to conduct peer review on studies and other research which are to be the basis of environmental public health policy.  The purpose of this procurement is to provide a mechanism for obtaining peer review for Toxicological Profiles, associated unpublished studies, and other agency products to address this requirement.
 
ATSDR is directed by congressional mandate to perform specific functions concerning the effect on public health of hazardous substances in the environment. These functions include public health assessments of waste sites, health consultations concerning specific hazardous substances, health surveillance and registries, response to emergency releases of hazardous substances, applied research in support of public health assessments, information development and dissemination, and education and training concerning hazardous substances.  This proposed procurement will provide support for the specific functions identified for the agency.

                                                              Statement of Work
 
 
The purpose of this proposed contract is to support ATSDR in carrying out the mission as identified by the agency.
 
Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall perform the following tasks as specified in individual task orders issued by the Government: 
 
1.         Peer Review.  Provide peer review for Toxicological Profiles, health and chemical specific consultations and other documents prepared by or submitted for review by the agency.  This work includes identifying reviewers with appropriate expertise, insuring and documenting the lack of conflict of interest in the review process, developing a plan for managing the review process within the time frame and within the context of the government needs, and providing reports in hardcopy or electronic format as appropriate in a manner most expeditious for utilizing the information in document development or review. 
 
2.         Expert Panel and other meeting support.  Provide a menu of panel meeting or conference support depending on the purpose, plan and objectives of the meeting.  Working with the Project Officer and Technical Contact, identify critical experts to participate in this activity.  Contact individuals to participate¡¦, develop a contract for services if necessary, develop travel plans, establish the facility for the meeting and coordinate post-meeting activities.  Plan announcements or publicity for the meeting, develop web-based meeting support as needed for information, registration or other needs.  Arrange facilities for the meeting and coordinate meeting details.  Support conduct of the meeting in coordination or registration procedures, audio-visual support and operation, facilitation of discussion periods, receptions and other meeting activities.   
 
3.         Educational support.  Working with the Project Officer and Technical Contact, identify best approach, plan and media for educational support program.  Identify technical experts to participate in training activity, establish necessary contract and other arrangements, and identify means for monitoring training or educational progress.  If needed, work with CDC training offices to insure training credit certification.

In some instances supplemental support will be needed in activities such as risk assessment, addressing community concerns, medical briefings, health studies and other programs conducted by the agency.  In certain instances, the need to bring independent resources separate from the agency may be required to appropriately address the issues of concern.  The Contractor, in consultation with the Project Officer, defines the necessary support for state or local public health groups.  The contractor develops a work plan to meet this technical requirement including:  experts consultants, plan of action, deliverables including final report if appropriate, materials to be developed or provided, and special expertise or activities dictated by the situation
 
            7.          Other Support services.

DIVISION OF TOXICOLOGY PEER REVIEW PROCEDURES  
ATSDR is required by Section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by Section 110 (P.L. 99-499) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, to use peer reviewed literature in its publications. Within the Division of Toxicology, the Emergency Response and Scientific Assessment Branch (ERSAB) provides the coordination of the peer review of Toxicological Profiles, Technical Reports, and relevant unpublished studies. The development of these documents is coordinated by the Toxicology Information Branch. This peer review process is done in accordance with the legislation mentioned previously and within guidelines established within the CDC/ATSDR Information Quality Peer Review which can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/od/ophr/infoqualpeerreview.htm
Information accepted as peer reviewed:
„@    Reports from peer reviewed journals, 
„@    Federal government reports that have an agency publication 
number, 
„@    Federal government contract reports that do not have an agency publication number but have a National Technical Information Service. (NTIS) number, 
„@    Proceedings of a symposium, and

„@    Books. 
Information not accepted as peer reviewed: 
„@    A doctoral dissertation or thesis that has been prepared as a 
requirement for college graduation and has not subsequently published in a peer reviewed journal or a book, 
„@    Non-peer reviewed journal (with exceptions e.g., Chemosphere, Environmental Health Perspective, and MMWR), 
„@    Industry reports, and 
„@    Federal government reports without an agency publication number or NTIS number. 
Information we do not have peer reviewed:

„@    Material ,Safety Data Sheets (MDSD), 

„@   Tables of numbers without supporting documentation to allow evaluation, 
„@   Abstracts (Note: Only in rare instances are abstracts ever included in a profile.) 


The process: 
„@   ATSDR issues a task order to Contractor for activity related to the contract. For most task orders, ATSDR submits: The list of profiled substances; set specific "Guidance for the Development of a Toxicological Profile;" and "Guidelines for Peer Review of ATSDR Profiles." 
„@   Contractor issues a work plan and cost estimate for performing the task order. 
„@   ATSDR accepts the work plan and estimate, or asks for modifications and/or clarifications before approval. 
„@ After approval of the task order for the profile set with the Profile Development Contractor, the schedule for profile set including peer review is shared with Contractor.

„@    Contractor provides ATSDR a list of potential reviewers (average of 5-8), in a prioritized order, with expertise in the field or the particular substance.Contractor confirms with the potential reviewers that there is no conflict of interest. The Chemical Manager reviews the list and then either approves the list or makes suggested changes in the prioritized order or suggested additions to the list. 
„@   The Chemical Manager decides which studies are to be peer reviewed. This may be done in consultation with the contract author. Using the criteria listed previously, the Chemical Manager selects the studies to be peer reviewed. It is not necessary to peer review "all" unpublished studies, only the studies that may have a significant contribution (not "me too" data) to the data known about the substance.  After the peer review of unpublished studies is approved by the Project Officer, the list of unpublished  studies to be reviewed is transmitted to Contractor by E-Mail.
„@    Contractor coordinates with the profile development contractor to prevent and handle any problems. 
„@    CONTRACTOR provides ATSDR and the profile contractor copies of the "Summary Report of Reviewer Comments on the Toxicological Profile for substance x" for each profile. This report may contain: The peer reviewers' summary reports; evaluation of unpublished studies; additional references and data submitted by the peer reviewers; and annotated pages from peer reviewers' profile documents. 
„@   If applicable, the Chemical Manager looks at each peer reviewer's evaluation of the unpublished study (this is in the "Summary Report of Reviewer Comments. ..") and decides if at least two of the three peer reviewers agree on the quality of the study. 
„@   The Project Officer will provide the Chemical Manager a form to use in rating the reviewers. 

 Miscellaneous 
„@   If an unpublished study is in a foreign language it must be translated before it is submitted for peer review.

Source Selection

Relative importance of the Evaluation Factors:  An offer must be acceptable in order for the Contractor to be eligible for award.  The Government will not award a contract on the basis of an unacceptable offer.  Thus, acceptability of the offer is the most important evaluation factor.  The Government considers a Contractor’s capabilities to be as important as price.  However, the Government will not select a Contractor for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  The relative influence that capability and price will have on the source selection decision will depend on the marginal differences among the competing Contractors.

Source Selection Decision

In order to select the winning offer, the Government will rank the Contractors from best to worst by making a series of paired comparisons among them, trading off the marginal difference in capability and price between the members of each pair.  If one Contractor has the better capability and the lower price, then that Contractor will be the better value.  If one Contractor has the better capability and the higher price, then the source selection decision will be based on whether the marginal difference in capability is worth the marginal difference in price.  If the Contracting Officer considers the better capability to be worth the higher price, then the more capable, higher-priced Contractor will be the better value.  If not, then the less capable, lower-priced Contractor will be the better value.

2.  ORCA is an e-Government initiative that was designed by the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) to replace the paper based Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs) process.  You must register on this site in order to submit your proposal.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; therefore, proposals are being requested within twenty (20) calendar days after issuance of this notice.  A written solicitation will NOT be issued.  This solicitation is from the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), MacDill AFB, Florida, for the acquisition of services to overhaul Pratt and Whitney, PT6A – 27 engines.  The AOC currently operates multiple aircraft equipped with PT6A-27 engines.  At this time, there is a total of six (6) engines that will require overhaul services as each engine reaches the point of Time Between Overhaul (TBO) hours (3600 hours).  This Request for Proposal (RFP) WC1330-06-RP-0033JAA is intended to identify qualified Contractors capable of providing all the labor, materials, equipment, special tools and facilities to overhaul the Government’s PT6A-27engines to a zero-time-since-overhaul status.  This RFP is being issued with the intent of awarding an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with an initial three (3)-year base period of performance with a minimum obligation value of $100,000 and two (2) 1-year option periods, each with a minimum obligation value of $50,000.  The IDIQ will identify base rates to be charged for performing overhaul services per Pratt and Whitney’s overhaul manual.  The first Task Order to be issued under the IDIQ is also included in this Combined Synopsis and will be evaluated per the evaluation criteria identified herein.  This RFP is issued as a 100% small business set-aside.  This RFP and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-06.  Signed and dated proposals must be submitted to the U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Central Region Acquisition Division, Attn:  Jane A. Allen,  601 East 12th Street,  Rm 1756, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.  Proposals must be received on or before 2:00 p.m. January 11, 2006.  Proposals may be faxed to 816-274-6993 - Attn:  Jane A. Allen.  Offeror’s sending a proposal via fax must follow up with one (1) originally signed proposal and three (3) additional copies in the mail postmarked no later than 2:00 p.m. January 11, 2006.

SCOPE OF SERVICES:

A.1  Overhaul Services

The Contractor shall disassemble the engines and perform an inspection as required under the Pratt and Whitney PT6A-27 overhaul manual.  Once the engines have been disassembled at the overhaul facility, the Contractor will provide the Government with a tear down inspection report that includes the extent of the inspection, condition of all major components, remaining routable life limits, outstanding service bulletins and airworthiness directives that must be complied with, and any recommendations for maintenance actions for the prevention of further expenses to the Government. 

All overhaul services must be performed in accordance with the Pratt & Whitney PT6A-27overhaul manual.  The Contractor shall replace all parts recommended by the manufacturer for replacement at each overhaul regardless of their apparent condition; this includes but is not limited to gaskets, packing rubber parts, lock washers and tab locks.  Only FAA approved parts are to be used.  Parts Manufacturer Approved (PMA) parts are preferred.  

Any life limited part or component that has not reached its recommended service life, but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an over-and-above discrepancy. Since the government cannot determine which parts or components, if any, meet this criteria, Offerors are required to provide the loaded hourly labor rate to be charged the Government for over-and-above discrepancies. Secondly, Offerors are required to provide the discount percentage to be applied to both new and overhauled replacement parts. PMA parts are acceptable. 

The Contractor will be responsible for documenting and reporting all over-and-above discrepancies to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) or the Assistant Contracting Officer Representative (ACOR) (the COR and ACOR are both members of the AOC staff). The documentation must include:
• Description of each discrepancy found
• Number of man-hours per discipline required to complete each discrepancy
• Hourly rate for personnel performing the work
• Parts costs (Show list price minus appropriate discount percentage)
• Total Dollar Amount for each discrepancy
• Total Dollar Amount for complete list of discrepancies
The COR will be responsible for reviewing the list of discrepancies and making a recommendation to either accept or decline the Contractor’s proposal. In the event additional work is recommended to the Contracting Officer (CO) by the COR, a formal approval document will be prepared by the CO and presented to the Contractor.  Therefore, no additional work shall be performed on the aircraft without prior approval from the CO.
Once the overhaul is complete the Contractor will run the engines on a test cell prior to certifying it ready for re-installation on the aircraft.  

The Contractor shall be responsible for all FAA and AOC required documentation.  

Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government. The cost of shipping the returnables shall be the responsibility of the Government.
During the term of this Contract, the Contractor may be required to subcontract portions of the inspection, maintenance, overhaul or repair work. In the event, such subcontracting becomes necessary, the Contractor shall notify the Government in advance of such subcontracting and provide the Government with the name, and any other requested information, of the proposed subcontractor. The Government reserves the right to initiate, and approve or disapprove, any subcontractor.

A.2    Engine Delivery 

Delivery of the engines requiring overhaul services can be accomplished as follows:

Option 1.  The Government may elect to have the Contractor remove and re-install the engines at the Contractor’s overhaul facility.  If so, the Government will fly the aircraft to the overhaul facility for removal of the engine and installation of a loaner engine.  Once the overhaul services have been completed, the Government will fly the aircraft back to the overhaul site for removal of the loaner engine and re-installation of the overhauled engine.

Option 2.  The Government may elect to remove the engine requiring overhaul services, crate it and transport it to the Contractor’s overhaul site.  The Contractor would be responsible for providing the Government with a crate suitable for shipping the PT6A-27 engines to the Contractor’s overhaul facility for services.  The Contractor would also be responsible for shipping loaner engines to the Government for installation and use while the overhaul services are being performed.  Once the Government’s engines have been completely overhauled, the Contractor would be responsible for shipping the overhauled engine back to the Government for re-installation in the aircraft.  The Government would de-install the loaner engine and return it in the crate provided by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall be responsible for all expenses incurred for the crates and transportation charges (including insurance during transport).

An alternate option for engine delivery  may be agreed upon by the parties at any time during the term of this contract.

A.3   Scheduling
Scheduling of services shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be identified within the Statement of Work issued as part of each Task Order awarded hereunder.

A.4 	Insurance Against Loss or Damage to Government Property:  The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain hull liability insurance of not less than $2,000,000.00 to cover the aircraft on which this work will be performed. Before award of this Contract, the Contractor shall provide to the CO written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained. The policies evidencing the required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government’s interest shall not be effective:
- For such a period as the laws of the State in which this work is to be performed prescribe; or
- Until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the CO, whichever period is longer.

A.5 	Parts and Warranties: The Contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials, and consumables. However, the Government reserves the right to provide the same, if advantageous at any time during the Contract. The Government will make the final determination on whether new, new surplus, overhauled, repaired, or serviceable parts will be installed on the aircraft. Parts and components in an “as removed” status will not be installed on the aircraft.
