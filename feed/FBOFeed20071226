<SOLNBR>ONRBAA07-021
<RESPDATE>082407
<CONTACT>Kenesha Hargrave, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-696-5345, Email hargrak@onr.navy.mil - Gary Toth, Program Officer, Phone 703-696-4961, Email tothg@onr.navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is advertising a research opportunity to invite proposals for the development of technology that supports the Globally Networked Maritime Headquarters with Maritime Operations Center (G-N MHQw/MOC) for planning and operational execution of plans. This Naval concept addresses the globally distributed nature of maritime operations and the need for new approaches to the problems this reality presents.  Joint doctrine development also addresses some of these issues in the concept of the Joint and Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander (J/CFMCC).  These concepts are related, and the J/CFMCC concept is included in the more broadly scoped MHQw/MOC.   In fact, the FORCEnet Enabling Capability (EC) in support of which this BAA is issued as FNT08-06 Globally Networked Joint & Coalition Force Maritime Component Commander (G-N J/CFMCC).  The program to develop needed technologies identified by the EC and addressed in this BAA is entitled: Globally Networked Maritime Headquarters with Maritime Operations Center (G-N MHQw/MOC). 

Two concepts of operations are relevant to the research opportunity : (1) MHQw/MOC) Concept of Operations (CONOPS), Draft Version 2.4, 31 Oct 2006); and (2) Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) TACMEMO 3-32-06 Final Draft June 2006.  Offerors and interested parties should consult these documents before responding to the research opportunity described in this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number 07-021.  Section VII of this BAA contains information about how to obtain a copy of the documents. Section VII, Subsection 3.0 provides more discussion on the relationship between this research program and the J/CFMCC and MHQw/MOC concept evolution including the capability gaps that have motivated the program thrusts.  Potential offerors should read Section VII to understand the context of this research initiative.

Proposed capabilities for the G-N MHQw/MOC should be capable of providing support to the seamless global operation of the Plans, Future Operations, and Current Operations cells.  The operations of these cells are described in NWDC TACMEMO 3-32-06, Sections 3.4 and 3.6.  Potential offerors should ensure that their white paper, oral presentation (if invited), and full proposal (if invited) address specifically how their technology offering will enhance the capabilities of the Plans, Future Operations, and Current Operations cells.  

This ONR research opportunity relates to the operational level of war, focusing on capabilities to enhance naval forces' plans, future operations, and current operations. BAA Number# 07-021 does not focus on tactical level technology capabilities or technologies supporting warfare execution.  Neither is BAA Number # 07-021 interested in technologies that will assist in purely administrative tasks, such as managing personnel or logistics, nor those supporting intelligence center operations alone. Certainly tactical, administrative and intelligence data and information are critical to planning and decision making in the MHQw/MOC  or J/CFMCC context and must be considered as critical sources of sensor data and information, so  reference to such may be made.  Technology proposals that focus exclusively on tactical level execution, administrative tasks, or intelligence functionality and fail to address command, control and planning at the operational level will not be considered responsive to this BAA. 

Potential offerors should incorporate experimentation with technology as a significant part of the technology development effort.  They should plan for table-top experimentation within six months of contract award to enable warfighters and acquisition program partners to engage in discussion of how the technology development will enhance warfighting.  They should plan for limited technology experimentation in twelve to fourteen months after contract award, to demonstrate to acquisition program of record partners how technologies will integrate with existing and planned systems that will support MHQw/MOC and J/CFMCC capabilities.  They should plan for limited objective experimentation, including participation in a Sea Trial event, in the last four months of the base period of contract performance to enable warfighters and acquisition program partners to witness that the technology development metrics have been met.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for the award of a sole source contract to the OPNET Technologies, Inc Corporation.  The Electronic Systems Center of the Air Force Material Command (AFMC) intends to contract for the annual maintenance, software upgrades and technical support, orginally awarded in Contract # 8726-06-C-0022, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)," Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  In this case, the USAF may deem products and/or services to be available only from the original sources in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized products or services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (see 10 U.S.C. 2304 (d)(1)(B)). The contractor's competitive selection for original software procurement necessitates continuity with said licenses. Knowledge must also include the software upgrades required, provide technical support to the OPNET product and how the users intend to operate the software within the AMF JTRS program.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 811213   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a sole source contract to Avaya Inc. for purposes of remedial and preventive maintenance services for its Octel 250 Voice Mail Message Server.  The server is used for all telephones located at the EPA Las Vegas Lab.  The basic preventive and remedial maintenance are needed to maintain the server 8 hours per day, 5 days a week.  Octel equipment is owned and maintained exclusively by Avaya Inc.  Equipment (remanufactured) may be purchased from outside the Avaya realm, but all maintenance services are  conducted through Avaya Inc.  There is a GSA Contract (GS-35F-4321D) for the maintenance of the Octel 250 Voice Mail Message Servers from Avaya.  Due to the critical need of voicemail throughout the EPA Las Vegas Lab and the rights of ownership Avaya maintains over the Octel equipment, it has been  determined that Avaya Inc. is the only source capable to provide maintenance service.  If there are any vendors who feel that they are capable of providing the same maintenance service as Avaya, please submit your capability statement to Elaine Scott via email at scott.elaine@epa.gov no later that  2pm EST December 28, 2007.

Responses to this notice will be used to determine if bona fide competition exists to provide pre-mission training at Hawthorne Army Depot.  Any such responses must be in writing and include documents that clearly demonstrate that the ability to train on the Hawthorne Army Depot and have full use of the installation ranges and other facilities.  The training shall include ambush training, quick reaction force training, IED training, BDAR and vehicle recovery, and mounted and dismounted live fire exercise.  The contractor shall provide knowledgeable instructors, vehicles, tents with heating, chairs, tables, mobile refrigerator/freezer storage units, role players with Afghanistan-like clothing, maintenance, repair, and trash removal.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to defend US deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack. As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capability, modify and improve on existing technologies (commercial and dual-use) for insertion into BMDS Elements, and improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats. To investigate these technologies and technology insertion opportunities, MDA has established a Deputy for Engineering, Producibility (DEP) whose mission is to identify technology insertion candidates and open/modular systems applications that enhance producibility, quality and/or reliability, lower cost and reduce risk for all BMDS elements. 

The MDA/DEP seeks new and innovative concepts for individual projects improving the producibility, quality and reliability of: (1) Anti-Tamper/Software Protection; (2) Radar Systems ? Antennas, Transmit/Receive Modules, Signal Processing, Optical Signal Processing, Thermal Management, RF Seekers; (3) Electro-Optical Systems - Passive IR and Optical Systems, Ladar, Focal Plane Arrays, High Energy Lasers, Beam Control; (4) Propulsion ? Booster, Divert and Attitude Control Systems (DACS) (5) Materials Processing ? Composite Structures, Thermal Management Materials, IR Windows; (6) Electronics - Wide Band Gap Materials and Devices, Radiation Hardened/Tolerant Electronics, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Data Links; (7) Power Systems ? Batteries, Fuel Cells, Photovoltaic Arrays; (8) Software ? application of COTS products to signal processing, middleware, operating systems, simulations and networking; and (9) Manufacturing Processes (supply chain management, obsolescence, and tin-whiskers). 

If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a summary white paper (not to exceed five pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA/MP program; (2) a Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) a description of the offerors capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities. Offerors that have been certified as a Small Business Concern should indicate that status on their submittal. Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .pdf file) to the point of contact listed below. White paper submissions should be marked appropriately if they contain proprietary or trade secret information. In addition, please advise the Government of any limitations on the Government?s rights in technical data, which might be provided in connection with the effort described in the white paper. 

The MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following criteria (weighed equally): (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA/DEP program, to include maturity and level of risk; (2) the ability to develop and demonstrate near-term applications; (3) the offer?s capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost effectiveness (the ROCM). Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement (FAR 35.016). This BAA will remain open until December 31, 2007. Evaluations may take up to six months from receipt of White Paper to complete. The Government may use selected support contractor and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement. These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information. Submission of white papers to this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgement and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process. MDA does not have a specified amount of funding available for BAA awards; however, if MDA does decides to pursue a concept, the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing. MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA. Any awards are anticipated to occur in FY 2006 through FY 2008. Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award) or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals submitted, or to select only part of an effort described in a proposal for award. The point of contact for concept submittals and questions is Adam Kitay, Contract Specialist, at (703) 882-6478, or email at Adam.Kitay.ctr@mda.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business concerns (SDVOSB), or for Small Businesses.  The estimated value of this procurement is between $100,000.00 and $250,000.00.  The small business size standard for NAICS 336611 is less than 1,000 employees.  The acquisition is to dry dock and repair the USCGC BOLLARD (WYTL-65614), a 65 foot "D" class harbor tug.  The homeport of the vessel is New Haven, Connecticut.  The performance period is forty (40) calendar days and is expected to begin on or about 19 May 2008 and end on or about 27 June 2008.  The vessel's availability will be geographically restricted to a facility within 144 nautical miles from its home moorings New Haven, Connecticut, on navigable waterways, and no more than 10 nautical miles off shore.  The scope of the acquisition is for the overhauling, renewing and repairing of various items aboard the USCGC BOLLARD (WPB-65614).  This work will include, but is not limited to: welding repairs, clean and inspect sewage holding tank, fabricate TLI support rod, remove, inspect, and reinstall propeller shaft, remove, inspect, and reinstall propeller, clean, inspect, and test grid coolers, renew transducers and preserve transducer hull rings, overhaul valves, remove, inspect, and reinstall rudder assembly, visual inspection of coating system, paint draft marks, renew cathodic protection system, routine dry docking, provide temporary logistics, preserve main weather deck, ultrasonic thickness measurements (includes 300 UT shots), reseal one-step deck covering systems, test hull half pipes, overhaul duplex sea strainer, composite labor, and laydays.  All welding and brazing shall be accomplished by trained welders, who have been certified by the applicable regulatory code performance qualification procedures.  In accordance with FAR 19.1305 and FAR 19.1405, if your firm is HUBZone certified or a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond in a letter either by e-mail to tomeka.evans@uscg.mil or by fax at (757) 628-4676.  In your response you must include (a) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers; (c) past performance references with points of contact and telephone numbers.  At least two references are requested, but more are desirable.  Your response is required by January 10, 2008 at 4:30 pm, EST.   Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a Hubzone set aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total Hubzone Set-aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.  Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business Set-Aside, FAR 52.219-27, Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business set aside, or Small Business set-aside.  Failure to submit all information requested may result in an unrestricted acquisition.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone, SDVOSB set-aside, or small business set-aside, will be posted in the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Questions may be referred to Ms. Tomeka Evans at (757) 628-4666.

<DESC>17. The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau's (IBB), Voice of America (VOA) and Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) are seeking qualified individuals for free-lance Radio and Television, English and foreign language news broadcasting assignments in Washington, DC; Miami, FL (for OCB); and overseas locations that are not serviced by full-time VOA and/or OCB staff correspondents.

The VOA and OCB make no guarantees on the amount of work assignments that contractors can expect to receive. 5) The Government is obligated to inspect all contractors performed work to insure that it fully satisfies the Government's requirements.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This is not a request for proposals and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) is conducting an end-user functionality and efficacy assessment of Law Enforcement Tactical Protective Helmets (LE Helmets) to validate their effectiveness when used by emergency responders in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or other hazardous environments.

The CDP is inviting manufacturers to provide information o LE Helmets equipment. The DHS Authorized Equipment List (AEL) item number for this equipment is 01LE-01-HLMT. The requested information will be included in the LE Helmets market research, will provide available product information, and will provide support information for the CDP LE Helmets assessment. By providing information in response to this RFI, you agree that the System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responder (SAVER) Program may use both the equipment information and any provided images in SAVER outreach.

The intent of the user assessment will be to provide the emergency response community with feedback on equipment based on utilization in scenarios that replicate, to the maximum extent possible, conditions that will be experienced in incident response. The assessment will not yield a determination of what product is best, nor shall the CDP endorse any product or manufacturer.

The assessment will be performed at the CDP by evaluators from emergency response agencies and jurisdictions across the United States. The selected evaluators will be actual users of this type of equipment in the field. The evaluators will be presented with specific scenarios and tasks to be carried out using the equipment as a responder wearing riot control gear with protective helmets. The scenarios will be tailored so that evaluation criteria can be objectively and subjectively assessed by each evaluator. The evaluation criteria will be compiled into five categories ? capability, usability, affordability, deployability, and maintainability.

If you wish to provide information about your particular brand/product, please provide in electronic format (MS Word) your company name, whether you are a manufacturer or a distributor, address, point of contact, telephone, fax, web address, and e-mail address.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

(2) Answer the following question received after the closing date for receipt of questions, but deemed necessary for preparation of the offerors proposal:

QUESTION: Can you please clarify:   Do we need to quote print only price for each title in addition to the print/online price, or do you only want the print price for titles that are not designated as print/online? To quote print only prices in addition to print/online, means we have to do two complete 
separate quotes, which may require additional time.

RESPONSE: Offerors should only provide online pricing for items designated print + online or online. Publisher licensing fees are NOT to be included.

(3) Delete the Paragraph entitled, PROPOSAL REQUIREMENT ? PRICING, under the solicitation in its entirety and replace with the following in lieu thereof: 

PROPOSAL REQUIREMENT - PRICING: This is a one (1) year contract that includes two additional one-year options. The offeror shall submit an overall cost proposal for the entire period of performance (base period and option periods). All offerors shall submit on separate line items for each year, an estimated price for the subscriptions to be renewed and its handling charge which shall include all costs necessary for providing the services.  Contractor should only provide online pricing for items designated print + online or online. Publisher licensing fees are not to be included. For estimating purposes, the offeror should assume an estimated not to exceed amount for rate adjustments and bill later charges which may occur of $6,500 during the base year, $8,125 for Option Year 1, and $10,500 for Option Year 2. OPTIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES: For estimating purposes the Contractor should assume an estimated not to exceed amount for new subscriptions and specialized electronic access services of $20.000 during the base year, $20,000 for Option Year 1 and $20,000 for Option Year 2.  Price will not be point scored.

(4)  Revise Attachment No. 2, entitled, List of Journal Titles. The list of journals in Microsoft Excel format cannot be uploaded in fbo.gov under the combined synopsis/solicitation format. Offerors may request a copy of Attachment 2 (revised) at e-mail address: mat1@nrc.gov.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0004 IS ISSUED TO PROVIDE ANSWERS TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. THE CLOSING DATE OF THE SOLICITATION REMAINS UNCHANGED AT DECEMBER 27, 2007, 2:00 PM EASTERN STANDARD TIME. Quotations must be signed, dated, and received by the closing date and ti me, via fax at 410-306-3726 or email at susan.sowa@us.army.mil at the US Army Contracting Agency, Directorate of Contracting, Attention: SFCA-NR-APC-T, 4118 Susquehanna Avenue, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005-3013.  For questions concerning this Request for Quotations contact Susan Sowa Contracting Specialist @ (410) 278-0771 or email susan.sowa@us.army.mil .  Please submit your quotations to Ms. Sowa via email to:  susan.sowa@us.army.mil or Fax 410-306-3726.  Note the following change in the W91ZLK-08-T- 0083 Specifications: 1 each  Sussman  3 kW steam generator based humidity system with a solid state relative humidity transmitter/sensor. Modified to read: 1 each  3 kW electric steam boiler based humidity system with a solid state relative humidity tran smitter/sensor.  The boiler must be capable of processing Deionized water. Provide boiler feed water pump as required.   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE AS FOLLOWS CLIN 0001 - QUESTION 13: I see a requirement for intake air and an exhaust blower.  Will there be solvent inside the chamber? How much exhaust/intake air is required?  The 3kw steam generator that is specified will not be able to produce enough steam to match the humidity rate specified if we are intaking and exhausting very much air. Answer: The air i nside the chamber is 100% recirculated. The air being exhausted is inside the machinery compartment (storage area for water tank, refrigeration, steam generator, etc). We need enough air changes to maintain good operating conditions for the mechanical equi pment in this space. The fresh air intake system that the specs reference is for the dehumidifier. There will be no solvents in the chamber. <BR><BR>
