<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: This announcement constitutes an official Request For Information (RFI).  This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations to select the best alternative for a full service Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract in support of the AN/AAR-57, Common Missile Warning System (CMWS).  A future solicitation/contract may provide PBL support and management services for the CMWS, component parts, and test sets, located worldwide.  This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP), or an Invitation For Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  An Industry Day will be announced at a later date for those interested parties seeking additional information.  Questions from concerned parties to be answered during Industry Day must be submitted no later than 20 calendar days after release of this RFI.<BR>BACKGROUND: The CMWS is considered critical mission-essential equipment used aboard all rotary wing and most fixed wing aircraft.  It is the core element of the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM) concept and is a US Army Acquisition Category ID (ACAT ID) program.  The CMWS program is satisfying the Armys requirements for enhanced aircraft survivability against Infrared (IR) guided threat missile systems.  The CMWS is the Aviation IR Survivability capability provider for the Future Force.  It will also complement, supplement and interface with other Aircraft Survivablity Equipment (ASE) to provide broad-spectrum platform protection.  Enhancements will continue to significantly reduce aircraft and aircrew casualties and permit extended operations within battle space environments populated with threat missiles.  The CMWS configurations vary by platform; currently there are 12 system versions.  <BR>The CMWS performs missile detection and classification, false alarm rejection, and missile declaration functions.  The CMWS also sends a missile alert signal to on-board avionics and other ASE.  In turn, visual and aural warnings to the aircrew are provided by on-board avionics systems.  Commands are issued to dispenser systems to eject decoys to provide for expendable countermeasures against an incoming infrared missile.  Each Electro-Optic Missile Sensor (EOMS) collects in-band electromagnetic radiation, converts it to electrical signals, and supplies these signals to the Electronic Control Unit (ECU).  The ECU analyzes this data to determine the existence of a missile threat.  If a threat exists, the ECU transmits missile threat messages to the APR-39 for further processing, threat display, and audio cueing or the ECU transmits audio directly to the Inter-Communications System (ICS) and displays the threat via the Control Indicator (CI) or Multi-Function Display (MFD).  Both the visual and aural indications provide threat type and relative position information to the pilots.  If the ECU determines that a missile launch has occurred, it supplies a command signal to the sequencers.  The sequencers process the Dispense Command Signal and then send a flare launch command to the dispensers, firing a flare solution.  Providing the CMWS is armed, a Flare solution will dispense automatically in an attempt to counter the incoming missile associated with that interaction.  The Digital Control Display Unit (DCDU) or CI, located in the cockpit, provides the pilot and co-pilot with interface to the CMWS.  The DCDU and CI display system status information, Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) inventory, and software version number.  In the event of an ECU failure, the MODE switch on the DCDU can be set to BYPASS to allow manual dispensing of munitions.  <BR>The CMWS is currently supported through Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) by a two level maintenance concept that includes field and depot level maintenance.  In accordance with Title 10, USC statutes, Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) repairs the ECU through a subcontract with the OEM.  Organic repair capability (through TYAD) for the EOMS will be established and will commence with a target date of 1QTR FY12.  The approved Army Procurement Objective is 3,916 A-Kits and 2,002 B-Kits.  B-Kits are issued as Mission Kits to Aviation Units being deployed into threat environments, and to select OCONUS-based units as directed by HQDA, DCS/G-3.  The Mission Kit Concept allows a smaller population of CMWS B-Kits to accomplish the desired mission, and places control of the B-Kits at a higher decision authority.  B-Kits not installed are stored in a centralized location.  Technical Data is available and can be provided upon request.  The anticipated PBL contract will cover supply chain management of the B-Kit, and potentially the A-Kit, engineering support, core depot capability, Packaging, Handing, Shipping and Transportation (PHS&T) and program management.  Software sustainment will transition to the CECOM Army Reprogramming and Analysis Team (ARAT).  Some collaboration/interface between the PBL contractor and the OEM and/or CECOM ARAT may be required.<BR>This RFI is intended to provide a forum to identify opportunities to decrease CMWS sustainment costs, improve CMWS sustainment efficiency, and increase sustainment readiness for CMWS customers.  Disclaimer: This Market Research and RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB, an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services, or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein.  If this office chooses to issue a RFP at some future date, another notice will be published. <BR>OBJECTIVE: This office will utilize a full service PBL contract implemented through a Public Private Partnership.  The PBL team will consist of a Product Support Integrator (PSI) (responsible for integrating all sources of support defined within the scope of the PBL contract to achieve desired outcomes) and multiple Product Support Providers (PSP) (service providers involved in sustainment of an acquisition system).  This office is searching for the best commercial source to serve as a Product Support Provider.  The overarching objective is to reduce cost without degrading current system readiness and reliability for both peace and war time arenas. <BR>The USG contemplates issuing a solicitation under FAR Part 15 that may result in the award of a five-year Fixed Price Incentive contract.  Estimated award date is NLT  2QTRFY11.  PM IRCM will serve as the single Product Support Integrator (PSI).  PSP Partnerships (in addition to a required Commercial Services Agreement with TYAD) are acceptable and encouraged as long as a single point of accountability for product support is identified.  This office plans to transition management of select A-Kit materials to DLA.  PM IRCM intends for the commercial PSP to partner with DLA through a non-binding partnering agreement to manage those items IAW FAR Part 51.  <BR>RESPONSES: Responses will be a 3 step process.  The first step is to inform the Government in writing (see SUBMISSION INFORMATION below), within 20 calendar days after the RFI release date, of interest in this PBL effort and submission of written questions to be answered at Industry Day.  The second step will be participation in a question and answer session at Industry Day.  The date and location will be announced through a separate FedBizOpps publication.  The final step is the submission of a written response to this RFI no later than 30 calendar days after Industry Day.  Responses shall be limited to 15 one-sided pages.   Submission shall be capable of being printed on 8.5 x 11 inch paper with one inch margin (top, bottom, left and right) and a 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font.  Line spacing shall be set at no less than single space.  Tables, drawings and header/footer information shall be 10 point Arial font or larger.  For tables and drawings, landscape orientation is permitted.  Microsoft Office Professional 2000 and PowerPoint 2000 or later shall be used to create the files.

<DESC>The development of complex software systems has benefitted significantly from the ability to leverage crowd-sourced innovation in the form of open source code development. Open source software hosting sites, a key enabler to the success of this development paradigm, facilitate collaborative development, source tree maintenance, and version control while allowing participation by a large number of independent programmers. Examples include SourceForge, Google Code, and GNU Savannah. The application of open source methods to the development of electromechanical systems has been more limited. And while one can identify several successful examples, they are largely confined to the development of relatively simple products (e.g., Quirky for consumer product design), or have required significant back-end engineering effort to turn product concepts into detailed designs (e.g., Local Motors for custom cars). DARPA has launched a portfolio of programs that aims, among other objectives, to democratize the design process for complex cyber-electro-mechanical systems such as defense and aerospace vehicles. The goal is to enable large numbers of unaffiliated developers to participate in the design of militarily-relevant systems such as ground vehicles, airplanes, rotorcraft, and space systems. To that end, DARPA is soliciting proposals for the development of vehicleforge.mil, an open source hosting site for the collaborative development of these systems. The principal technical challenge associated with this capability is a general representation language that is rich enough to describe a broad range of cyber-electro-mechanical systems, yet formal enough that the system can be compiled or verified in some manner when a design change is made to some element or aspect of it. For complete details of the BAA, refer to the attachment - DARPA-BAA-11-21.

FMD antibody responses in swine, cattle, sheep and goats.<br />b. FMD-specific cellular immune responses in cattle (e.g., T cell assays such as flow cytometry, ELISPOT, Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiling).<br />c. Innate immune responses in cattle (e.g., TLR expression, pro-inflammatory cytokines, bovine innate immunity microarray).</p>
<p>(b) Obtain and analyze FMD humoral immune response data in (3) FMD susceptible North American wildlife ruminant species that were administered an Adenovirus-vectored FMD adjuvant vaccine candidate:<br />a. Elk (Cervus elaphus)<br />b. White-tailed (Odocoileus virginianus) or mule (Odocoileus hemionus) deer<br />c. Bison (Bison bison)</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The AF ISR Agency issues this sources sought synopsis for information and planning purposes in support of the acquisition of environmental and particle analysis services. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the government pay for information solicited. The services to be acquired are primarily concerned with separation, manipulation, analysis, and identification of micron particulate matter for the purpose of nuclear test ban treaty verification. Definition of some terms: sample = physical object requiring processing to isolate particles of interest for analysis; particle = singular microscopic item of interest requiring analysis for elemental, morphological, and isotopic information. Sample analysis requires the ability to: (a) process and analyze samples provided by the government; (b) process and analyze 6,000 particles per year from as many as 300 samples per year; (c) perform thermal ion mass spectrometry analysis of 6,000 particles per year; (d) perform secondary ion mass spectroscopy isotopic and elemental analysis on 50 samples per year; (e) maintain all processing areas and microscope clean rooms in accordance with the current General Services Administration standards for clean room and workstation requirements; (f) maintain class 100 clean room techniques sufficient to ensure no cross-contamination between samples; (g) describe and characterize sample particle isotopics, morphologies, and elemental compositions using all available analytical techniques; and (h) maintain the capability to perform isotopic and elemental analyses via scanning techniques such as microscope, electron microprobe, or ion beam; and (i) provide stoichiometry information on selected particles. Other requirements include: (a) in the event the Government elects to procure environmental and particle analysis services, prospective sources must possess, or show the capability to obtain, a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Radioactive Materials License (or an agreement state license/permit, as applicable for the facility where work will be performed), prior to performance start; (b) offerors shall be responsible for providing a suitable site for performance of the contract requirements. Unique mission essential analysis equipment will be provided, with ownership retained by the government. Due to the potential of contaminating mission samples, analysis equipment and areas of any facility used for environmental and particle analysis services shall not be used for activities other than this contract without the expressed written permission of the government program office and shall be isolated from other facilities doing nuclear work; and (c) prospective sources would be required to have DOD security clearances of at least the SECRET level. Participation in this potential effort would require both a facilities and storage capability of at least the SECRET level. Prospective sources would be required to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET level. No information related to this acquisition or resulting contract is releasable to foreign nationals. A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is contemplated with a one-year basic contract period and four 1-year options. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541380/$12.0 million. No technical or solicitation documents exist at this time. Interested offerors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating their ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. Firms must respond electronically to Ms Lois. Brockson at lois.brockson@patrick.af.mil within 15 calendar days from the date of publication. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations to select the best alternative for a full service Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract in support of the AN/AAR-57, Common Missile Warning System (CMWS). A future solicitation/contract may provide PBL support and management services for the CMWS, component parts, and test sets, located worldwide. This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP), or an Invitation For Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. An Industry Day will be announced at a later date for those interested parties seeking additional information. Questions from concerned parties to be answered during Industry Day must be submitted no later than 20 calendar days after release of this RFI.<BR><BR>BACKGROUND: The CMWS is considered critical mission-essential equipment used aboard all rotary wing and most fixed wing aircraft. It is the core element of the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM) concept and is a US Army Acquisition Category ID (ACAT ID) program. The CMWS program is satisfying the Armys requirements for enhanced aircraft survivability against Infrared (IR) guided threat missile systems. The CMWS is the Aviation IR Survivability capability provider for the Future Force. It will also complement, supplement and interface with other Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to provide broad-spectrum platform protection. Enhancements will continue to significantly reduce aircraft and aircrew casualties and permit extended operations within battle space environments populated with threat missiles. The CMWS configurations vary by platform; currently there are 12 system versions. <BR><BR>The CMWS performs missile detection and classification, false alarm rejection, and missile declaration functions. The CMWS also sends a missile alert signal to on-board avionics and other ASE. In turn, visual and aural warnings to the aircrew are provided by on-board avionics systems. Commands are issued to dispenser systems to eject decoys to provide for expendable countermeasures against an incoming infrared missile. Each Electro-Optic Missile Sensor (EOMS) collects in-band electromagnetic radiation, converts it to electrical signals, and supplies these signals to the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The ECU analyzes this data to determine the existence of a missile threat. If a threat exists, the ECU transmits missile threat messages to the APR-39 for further processing, threat display, and audio cueing or the ECU transmits audio directly to the Inter-Communications System (ICS) and displays the threat via the Control Indicator (CI) or Multi-Function Display (MFD). Both the visual and aural indications provide threat type and relative position information to the pilots. If the ECU determines that a missile launch has occurred, it supplies a command signal to the sequencers. The sequencers process the Dispense Command Signal and then send a flare launch command to the dispensers, firing a flare solution. Providing the CMWS is armed, a Flare solution will dispense automatically in an attempt to counter the incoming missile associated with that interaction. The Digital Control Display Unit (DCDU) or CI, located in the cockpit, provides the pilot and co-pilot with interface to the CMWS. The DCDU and CI display system status information, Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) inventory, and software version number. In the event of an ECU failure, the MODE switch on the DCDU can be set to BYPASS to allow manual dispensing of munitions. <BR><BR>The CMWS is currently supported through Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) by a two level maintenance concept that includes field and depot level maintenance. In accordance with Title 10, USC statutes, Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) repairs the ECU through a subcontract with the OEM. Organic repair capability (through TYAD) for the EOMS will be established and will commence with a target date of 1QTR FY12. The approved Army Procurement Objective is 3,916 A-Kits and 2,002 B-Kits. B-Kits are issued as Mission Kits to Aviation Units being deployed into threat environments, and to select OCONUS-based units as directed by HQDA, DCS/G-3. The Mission Kit Concept allows a smaller population of CMWS B-Kits to accomplish the desired mission, and places control of the B-Kits at a higher decision authority. B-Kits not installed are stored in a centralized location. Technical Data is available and can be provided upon request. The anticipated PBL contract will cover supply chain management of the B-Kit, and potentially the A-Kit, engineering support, core depot capability, Packaging, Handing, Shipping and Transportation (PHS&T) and program management. Software sustainment will transition to the CECOM Army Reprogramming and Analysis Team (ARAT). Some collaboration/interface between the PBL contractor and the OEM and/or CECOM ARAT may be required.<BR><BR>This RFI is intended to provide a forum to identify opportunities to decrease CMWS sustainment costs, improve CMWS sustainment efficiency, and increase sustainment readiness for CMWS customers. Disclaimer: This Market Research and RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB, an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services, or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization. This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited. This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein. If this office chooses to issue a RFP at some future date, another notice will be published. <BR><BR>OBJECTIVE: This office will utilize a full service PBL contract implemented through a Public Private Partnership. The PBL team will consist of a Product Support Integrator (PSI) (responsible for integrating all sources of support defined within the scope of the PBL contract to achieve desired outcomes) and multiple Product Support Providers (PSP) (service providers involved in sustainment of an acquisition system). This office is searching for the best commercial source to serve as a Product Support Provider. The overarching objective is to reduce cost without degrading current system readiness and reliability for both peace and war time arenas. <BR><BR>The USG contemplates issuing a solicitation under FAR Part 15 that may result in the award of a five-year Fixed Price Incentive contract. Estimated award date is NLT 2QTRFY11. PM IRCM will serve as the single Product Support Integrator (PSI). PSP Partnerships (in addition to a required Commercial Services Agreement with TYAD) are acceptable and encouraged as long as a single point of accountability for product support is identified. This office plans to transition management of select A-Kit materials to DLA. PM IRCM intends for the commercial PSP to partner with DLA through a non-binding partnering agreement to manage those items IAW FAR Part 51. <BR><BR>RESPONSES: Responses will be a 3 step process. The first step is to inform the Government in writing (see SUBMISSION INFORMATION below), within 20 calendar days after the RFI release date, of interest in this PBL effort and submission of written questions to be answered at Industry Day. The second step will be participation in a question and answer session at Industry Day. The date and location will be announced through a separate FedBizOpps publication. The final step is the submission of a written response to this RFI no later than 30 calendar days after Industry Day. Responses shall be limited to 15 one-sided pages.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>The purpose of this sources sought notice is to conduct market research to assist in determining whether to set this acquisition aside for small business, 8(a), HUBZone small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. Any interested small business, 8(a), HUBZone small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern may submit a capabilities statement demonstrating its ability to perform the requirement. The capabilities statement should conform with the instructions provided below.</p>
<p>THE REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), anticipates a requirement for Construction Manager as constructor (CMc) services for the renovation of Building 1 (B1R) on NIST's campus in Boulder, Colorado. The NAICS code for the proposed acquisition is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the Small Business size standard is $33.5 million. The project is planned to be announced in the fall of 2010 with an award anticipated for the spring of 2011. The estimated price range of this project is $50,000,000.00 to $80,000,000.00. The performance period for this project is estimated at one thousand ninety five (1095) calendar days after the written Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>The proposed NIST B1R project is a necessity for NIST's continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market. The B1R will provide extensive renovation of approximately three fourths of Building 1, including Wings 3, 4, 5, 6 and a portion of the Center Spine. This will provide 150,000 net assignable square feet of high performance laboratory space to perform research and measurements needed by industry and the scientific community. The B1R consists of enhanced temperature control down to +/- 0.5 degree C, humidity control to +/- 5%, continuous air flow with filtration to class 10,000, and new service corridors to provide lab support space for utilities in addition to the pedestrian corridor. The building will be occupied throughout the construction process.</p>
<p>Electrical elements included in the renovation will address components such as lighting, power distribution, power quality, electromagnetic interference, and standby emergency power for critical laboratory functions. The B1R will locate the bus ducts in the service corridors. Chilled water, steam, and compressed air will be supplied from the Boulder site Central Utility Plant. Communication elements that will be addressed include infrastructure components such as telephone cabling and fiber optic networks for data. Life safety and building security elements in the renovation include components such as fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, and building access control. Renovation design and construction will comply with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and will be submitted for LEED certification for existing buildings. Renovation design will comply with ADA Standards for accessible design as most recently revised.</p>
<p>The renovation will provide a facility that will allow NIST to advance measurement science, standards and technology beyond current constraints. Electronic, optical, radiation, chemical and information technologies will be supported. The renovation will support key technology areas such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, new energy sources, computing and telecommunications in a high performance facility.</p>
<p>Environmental and space requirements for the B1R are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST's technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness. The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1R are not being effectively and economically met with laboratory space currently occupying a structure dedicated in 1954.</p>
<p>CMc:</p>
<p>The CMc shall provide pre-construction phase services and construction phase services. The CMc's contract will consist of a firm fixed price basic requirement for pre-construction phase services and optional requirements for construction phase services for the exterior and interior divided amongst the wings and sections of the building, which will be awarded with a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) not to exceed $80,000,000 for all options.</p>
<p>Pre-Construction Phase Services shall include, but may not be limited to, review and evaluation of concept, design development and construction documents, constructability review, sustainable design review, consultation during construction document production, preliminary project schedule development, recommendations on phased construction, cost estimates, development of subcontractor and supplier interest, and identification of long-lead items. Also included in this phase will be the development of a migration plan for Building 1 occupants emphasizing minimal impact to NIST's core mission during a multi-year phased construction.</p>
<p>Construction Phase Services shall include, but not be limited to, administration of the construction contract (whether the work is performed with the CMc's own forces or under subcontract), coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, record keeping, progress reporting, schedule control, inspections, testing, and other required supplemental LEED services. The CMc shall review all construction document submissions for constructability and ensure conformance to the project budget. The CMc shall review A-E cost estimates, shall provide independent cost estimates and recommend adjustments to the estimates or the design to assure that the project stays within budget. The CMc shall provide NIST with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, necessary actions, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting. The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration. The CMc shall have complete responsibility for construction of the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier. A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet at 800-333-0505 or on line at <br />https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html.</p>

ESAF System Parameters

System Function
 ESAF function is to detect and locate, diagnose, and render safe/neutralize electronic fuzing, power supplies including the energized circuitry and sensor suites outside of their detection envelopes and is man and/or machine employed.
  The system must be able to detect passive and active, energized circuitry and sensor suites without influencing the circuit, and determine the armed and/or safe status of electronic fuzing, this must happen in real time.  The system will not be required to detect targets that are buried beneath the earths surface.  


	Detection range 
The detection range is the distance at which the ESAF system must be able to detect a threat.  The system should be able to detect a threat when mounted on a vehicle at a minimum distance of 50 meters plus the stopping distance when traveling at maximum speed of 50kph. (It is estimated that the maximum speed that a fully loaded EOD vehicle would travel is 50kph.)   The detection fan area is the space in front of the vehicle that would provide detection capabilities of 50 meters in both directions measured from the center line of the vehicle.
  This would provide a 180 arc in front of the vehicle.  The system also needs to be able to detect 25 meters up and 10 meters below the mounted position on the vehicle to provide detection capabilities when passing over or going under overpasses, hills, etc.  These thresholds will provide a detection bubble in the front of the vehicle.  The threat may be non-line of sight.

Thresholds:  Mounted moving vehicle:  50 meters plus the stopping distance, 180 arc 

When the system is deployed in the dismounted configuration the minimum distance for detection of threat must be 25 meters.  The speed of a normal person walking in a dismounted operation is estimated between 3 to 5 mph.  The ESAF system must cover a 120 arc in front of the patrol.
   The threat may be non-line of sight.

	Threshold:  Dismounted 25 meters, 120 arc

The above distances were derived from the 5 - 25  50 rule used by EOD when responding to an incident.  The 5 meters is a visible radius check around the vehicle as soon as it comes to a stop.  The 25 meters is an expanded radius check using detection equipment.  The 50 meters is the minimum distance to a threat from the vehicle.
	
Locate
To locate a threat are those actions taken to determine the presence and fix the location that would be needed to perform a neutralization/render safe procedure (see Neutralize/Render Safe Procedures) of an unexploded explosive ordnance or IED that has an ESAF type firing system.
  The ESAF location system must be able to locate electronic fuzing, power supplies, energized circuitry, and sensor suites outside of their detection range, estimated to be 50 to 100 meters maximum.  This needs to happen within the detection capabilities and detection range thresholds.

Diagnose
Diagnose whether the electronic fuzing, power supplies, energized circuitry, and sensor suites are actually active and functioning outside of their detection range, estimated to be 50 to 100 meters maximum.  This would occur while stationary and at road speeds of 50 kph during mounted operations.
	Threshold  50 meters  
Objective  Less then 50 meters

Neutralize/Render Safe Procedure
Neutralize/RSP the electronic fuzing, power supplies, energized circuitry, and sensor suites outside of their detection range, estimated to be 50 to 100 meters maximum.
 This would occur from a stationary position.
	Threshold  50 meters
Objective  Less then 50 meters

Set Up Time:
Time required preparing the ESAF, while in the safe area, for use.  Preparation assumes the system is already mounted or pre-positioned on platform, and would be time from turn on to ready, including any checks to ensure functionality and mount or add any additional parts necessary for use.
	Threshold  5 minutes
		
Interoperability
Ability of system to be interoperable with the platform or prime mover it is mounted to.  This includes being interoperable with power systems, vehicle protective systems, other attachments to the platform (i.e. antennas), and currently existing mounts.
  
Threshold  Must be interoperable with current tactical vehicles used by Joint EOD forces.

Compatibility
Capability of the system to be used at the same time as other EOD equipment in the area (i.e. CREW systems)		
Threshold  Operable in a CREW environment  

Ease of Use / Training
Must be employed by an EOD technician with existing skills and requires a minimal amount of system training.
	Threshold  System training shall be designed to be conducted at unit level

Time on target
The time it takes to detect the target; perform a RSP/neutralization procedure and perform the final diagnoses on the fuze.
Threshold  20 minutes

Definitions 
	
	Unexploded Ordnance (UXO)  Military munitions that have been primed, fused, armed, or otherwise prepared for action, and have been fired, dropped, launched, projected, or placed in such a manner as to constitute a hazard to operations, installation, personnel, or material and remain unexploded either by malfunction, design, or any other cause.

Improvised Explosive Device (IED)  An expediently packaged explosive charge detonated by an initiator with a customized fuzing and firing circuit, also known as a bomb.

Objects of Interest  The subject matter of attention, for example, mail, small parcels, personal articles carried on personnel, and personnel themselves.

Detect/Locate - Those actions taken to determine the presence and fix the exact location of unexploded explosive ordnance or IEDs.
  

	Disruption  
(1) An EOD technique designed to cause deflagration, low-order detonation of the main charge, or mechanical breakup of an explosive-loaded ordnance item by attacking the item's case. 
(2) An EOD technique designed to separate the firing train components of an improvised explosive device (lED). 

Render Safe/Neutralize - The application of special unexploded explosive ordnance methods and tools to provide for the interruption of functions or separation of essential components of unexploded explosive ordnance to prevent an unacceptable detonation.  The ordnance is said to be neutralized when it has been rendered incapable of firing, or made harmless by chemical action.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office announces a Sources Sought Synopsis Number N00189-11-S-RSNF, to support the Naval Education and Training Security Assistance Field Activity (NETSAFA), Pensacola, FL.  This announcement is issued for informational and planning purposes only.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis.  Responses to the synopsis will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers that could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. NETSAFA requests information from interested parties that are capable of providing a response to the following descriptions.
                                                       
Under the anticipated contract, the Administrator (also known as the Third Party Administrator) will provide health care administration services for a group of Saudi military personnel assigned to the United States and Canada and their authorized dependants.
 This requirement is for administration and bill paying only and is not for the medical insurance itself. The Administrator will provide a claim system for the submittal of claims by various health care providers, screen the claims to determine if the coverage under the benefit conforms and are considered reasonable and customary, and promptly pay the provider accordingly. The Administrator will be reimbursed for claims paid out through the contract. The Administrator must have access to a working fund from which initial payments for claims will be made pending reimbursement under the contract.  

RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONTRACTOR. 

1.Role as Administrator.  Contractor will act as the Administrator for the Royal Saudi Naval Forces Medical Plan.
 The following are the principal duties of the Administrator:

a.CONTRACTOR will receive bills for medical, dental, and related health services provided to Plan members. These bills will be screened to determine that the services provided are eligible under the Plan, that the amounts billed do not exceed Reasonable and Customary (R&C) costs for the geographical area where provided, and make payments to providers accordingly.

b.CONTRACTOR will have responsibility for management of approval action for all types of pre-treatment plans developed by providers in accordance with the requirements of this Plan. Dental treatment plans, which require case-by-case approval will be analyzed by the CONTRACTOR and forwarded, with appropriate recommendation, to Assistant Defense Attache for Naval Affairs (ADANA).
 Orthodontic treatment plans will be handled as outlined in the Schedule of Benefits, Section H.   

c.A Utilization Review (UR) manager will be contracted for by the CONTRACTOR. The UR manager will have responsibility for the validation of medical need in cases where inpatient care is ordered by an authorized health professional. The UR manager will determine the need for second opinion, the appropriateness of the planned length of hospital stay, and hospital status in a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO), all conditions for authorizing admission.

d.CONTRACTOR will advise the sponsor (or NETSAFA if the sponsor cannot be contacted) in any case where admission is denied based on the above criteria.
 In these cases the CONTRACTOR will also provide the names of alternative hospital(s) if appropriate.

e.The Administrator will not mandate use of PPO physicians by members, but will restrict admission to hospitals, which are members of a qualified PPO, when reasonably available.

f.All inquiries regarding hospitalization should be directed to the CONTRACTOR.

g.CONTRACTOR will have sole responsibility for the performance of subcontractors it employs in executing the requirements of the Administrator's contract.

h.CONTRACTOR will maintain a membership data base in accordance with direction received from NETSAFA in order to be able to confirm to provider's membership inquiries.
 CONTRACTOR will also provide Medical Plan ID cards, Paid Prescription cards, Reimbursement Claim Forms, and Summary Plan Description (SPD) copies to NETSAFA for distribution to new members.       

i.CONTRACTOR will automatically advise providers whose charges for services exceed R&C levels, providing appeal options should the provider not agree with the payment level. CONTRACTOR will also respond to subsequent inquiries made by providers or their agents who seek to make collections of any kind, if provided the appropriate correspondence.

NETSAFA will provide health care administration services (in accordance with the anticipated contract) for Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) personnel assigned for periods longer than 60 days to training and training supervisory and support duties in the United States and Canada and their authorized dependents.
  Typically the majority of RSNF students are located for training at U.S. Navy or other U.S. Department of Defense installations in the continental U.S.  The present composition of the group to be served includes a total of approximately 200 military personnel and an additional 375 dependents.  It is expected that the total number of persons in these categories will increase over the life of the contract.  This group is usually distributed in about 15 geographic locations across the U.S. with the largest single area of concentration occurring in the Pensacola, FL area where approximately 50% of the group is located.  RSNF students are usually assigned to training sequences in the U.S. ranging from 6 to 30 months and may change individual training sites several times during this period.

It is desired to provide a broad selection of high quality health care services to the RSNF personnel (sponsors) and their authorized dependents.
  Ideally these services will be available to group members without the necessity that the services be paid for at the time of delivery or that the sponsor be required to file the claim for payment.  The claim system will require the health care provider to perform the necessary claim completion and submission to the group Administrator who, in turn, will screen the claim to determine coverage under the benefit plan and the conformance of charges to whats reasonable and customary as defined by a recognized national data base of prevailing fees which is routinely updated, and promptly pay the providers accordingly. Therefore, interested parties will be required to have a $350K working capital to allow full payment on all claims before being submitted to the Navy.
  Estimated medical expenses are about $3.6-4.1M per year. 

All responding sources shall provide a summary of their companys capabilities including organization name, address, description of facilities, personnel, and past experience; and a point of contact, telephone number, facsimile number, email address, business size, DUNs number, and CAGE Code.  All submissions must be received by close of business 5 November 2010.  Responses to the Sources Sought are required in writing, to Ms. Stephanie Wilson, 270.2Y, 700 Robbins Avenue, Bldg 2B, Philadelphia, PA  19111, or email address Stephanie.wilson1@navy.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistics Center has a requirement to remanufacture Caterpillar 3516 Diesel Engines in support of the 110' "C" Class Coast Guard Cutters. The Government will allow competitive offers to be submitted for this remanufacture; however, all work must be done in accordance with OEM Standards and Specifications using ONLY new, genuine Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts. Remanufactured and aftermarket parts are not acceptable. It is anticipated that a firm, fixed priced, 5 year requirements contract will be awarded to an Authorized Caterpillar Repair Facility for the remanufacturing of these engines. It is the Government's belief that only Caterpillar Inc., the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), has the required technical, engineering specifications, drawings and expertise to effectively remanufacture these engines. Additionally, concerns that have previously been successful in providing certain Caterpillar Engines Remanufactures to the Government are encouraged to quote; along with the quote must be specific evidence showing previous success of remanufacturing, including contract number, date, NSN and part numbers of engines, at a minimum. The information required to properly complete this job is proprietary to Caterpillar Inc. The Government did not procure this information, or the rights to use this information, under the original contract. Therefore, it is the Government's intention to solicit and negotiate only with Caterpillar or concerns as stated above. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to remanufacture the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing the same within 5 calendar days from the day this notice is posted. The information that must be submitted includes: (1) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the capability to remanufacture to OEM standards (2) Data that the facility has satisfactorily remanufactured these exact engines for the Government. This data must be sufficient to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate the information relative to the above requirements. Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall NOT be considered for this acquisition. The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned. The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited. This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and HSAM 3006.302-1. For information regarding this acquisition, contact the contracting officials listed herein.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.

<SUBJECT>Pre-Solicitation Meeting/Industry Day announcement for the Development and Production of the Arleigh Burke Class Destroyer (DDG 51) Hybrid Electric Drive (HED) for Backfit Fuel Savings
<SOLNBR>N0002411R4207
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command will be conducting a Pre-Solicitation Meeting/Industry Day for the Arleigh Burke Class Destroyer (DDG 51) Hybrid Electric Drive (HED) Electric Propulsion System (EPS) for Backfit Fuel Savings acquisition. The purpose of this meeting is to provide interested companies with an overview of the HED Program and an opportunity to gather more information prior to the Request for Proposals (RFP) being issued. A general session will be held for interested parties to obtain information from the Government program management team.  

The Secretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Operations have identified fuel conservation and reducing fuel consumption leading to energy independence a top priority for the Navy.
  The large numbers and remaining service life of the DDG 51 Class ships provides one of the best opportunities for long term fuel savings.  The HED-EPS shipsets will include the propulsion motors, motor drives and the associated controls, interfaces, and mounting equipment that will be required to install the HED-EPS on DDG 51 Class ships.  When installed aboard a ship, the HED-EPS will permit the crew to turn off of one or more propulsion gas turbines and allow more efficient operation of the existing gas turbine generators, which will be generating electric power for the HED-EPS as well as all the existing ships electrical loads.  

The eventual acquisition may include the development of pre-production units for land based evaluation and options for the intended annual production.
  The intent of the Pre-Solicitation Meeting/Industry Day is to introduce a draft of the possible RFP text, review the Navy requirements trade study, and to review the present state of the performance specification for the HED-EPS, so that industry can become familiar with the considerations that are leading to the acquisition decisions.  Subsequent to the Pre-Solicitation Meeting/Industry Day, one-on-one meetings may be scheduled for direct industry feedback on the documents discussed and the status of the effort.  As this is not a solicitation, no attendee firm should view this as an opportunity to exhibit its qualifications or technical merit that distinguish itself from others in attendance.
 Questions and conversation that appears to steer in this direction will be discouraged.

Please limit attendance from each company to three individuals as the total attendance will be limited. Attendees must be US Citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens and must represent bona fide US Department of Defense (DoD) contractors as the presentation materials may include limited distribution information.  Evidence in the form of an executed DD Form 2345 (MILITARILY CRITICAL TECHNICAL DATA AGREEMENT) will be required prior to admission. Please pre-register via email to the following address: joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil no later than Friday November 5, 2010. Registration will be confirmed via a responding e-mail and failure to register will prohibit admittance.
  Please provide the individuals name, company, phone and e-mail address in addition to the DD 2345.  The Government intends to publish a list of attendees to encourage subcontracting opportunities.  Note: This is NOT a "bidders conference" and this announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind. The Government will not assume liability for costs incurred by any offeror for presentations, marketing efforts or data offered for examination; therefore the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.

Date: Wednesday, November 17, 2010

Time: Check-in at 8:00am; General Session from 8:30am to 2:30pm.

Location: Computer Sciences Corporation, (Maritime Plaza 2, 2nd floor, Room 201) 1220 12th St.

A full and open competitive follow-on Pre-Planned Product Improvement contract is in its planning phase, and will be solicited as soon as the GFP (software) necessary for the RFP has been identified.  It is not considered in the best interest of the government to incur the additional costs and time that would be required to bring a new contractor on board to complete the IGC effort.  The DPPH ceiling increase also includes planned effort for the on-going MDA and Navy experiments designed to increase the performance envelope of the fielded JTAGS systems.<BR>This modification will provide support through 30 Sep 2013.  All responsible sources may submit a response, timely submitted , which shall be considered.  Interested parties may identify their interest, in writing, to the Government point of contact (POC), Ms. Christy L. Tarantini.  Response to this notice must be received no later than, 5 November 2010, 12:00 p.m. CST. The point of contact for this notice is Ms. Christy L.

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">OVERVIEW Two Federal agencies and one private Foundation came together in 2009 to implement a programmatic initiative designed to inform the development, implementation, and refinement of a systems-level intervention combined with traditional Juvenile Drug Court operations. Specifically, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) jointly sponsored an initiative to improve outcomes for drug-involved youth in the juvenile justice system through intentional efforts to combine the structure of a Juvenile Drug Court with the RWJF's Reclaiming Futures[1] model. Although, on the surface, the two strategies are different in structure and methods used, they are quite complementary in resolving barriers to change and assisting adolescents in the achievement of recovery and warrant further investigation as to their combined effects. The initiative goals include: 1. Make system-wide improvements in the identified communities in their delivery of Juvenile Drug Courts Services and practices. 2. Improve the quality of care by using evidence-based practices and fidelity measures. 3. Increase successful completion of treatment, and reduce recidivism during and after participation by improving overall system functioning. In 2009, OJJDP, a component of the U.S Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs, transferred funds to the Library of Congress' Federal Research Division to support an evaluation of the Juvenile Drug Court Reclaiming Futures initiative. The Library of Congress' Federal Research Division is seeking bids from applicants who can accomplish this activity. About the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) OJJDP, a component of the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs, provides national leadership, coordination, and resources to prevent and respond to juvenile delinquency and victimization. OJJDP supports states and communities in their efforts to develop and implement effective and coordinated prevention and intervention programs and to improve the juvenile justice system so that it protects public safety, holds offenders accountable, and provides treatment and rehabilitative services tailored to the needs of juveniles and their families. http://ojjdp.ncjrs.gov. About Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) SAMHSA is a public health agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency is responsible for improving the accountability, capacity and effectiveness of the nation's substance abuse prevention, addictions, treatment, and mental health services delivery system. Through its Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) SAMHSA provides support for treatment of addictions. www.samhsa.gov. About the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) RWJF focuses on the pressing health and health care issues facing our country. As the nation's largest philanthropy devoted exclusively to improving the health and health care of all Americans, the Foundation works with a diverse group of organizations and individuals to identify solutions and achieve comprehensive, meaningful and timely change. For more than 35 years the Foundation has brought experience, commitment, and a rigorous, balanced approach to the problems that affect the health and health care of those it serves. www.rwjf.org. BACKGROUND Virtually all career criminals start as juvenile offenders, with most having repeated contacts with the juvenile justice system along the way. Current estimates identify approximately 93,000 young people held in juvenile justice facilities across the United States. Given this landscape, there may be a critical need to identify effective models for Justice involved youth and the organization of the systems serving them. Juvenile Drug Courts has been one such intervention used, and has its roots in the adult drug court efforts that started in the late 80's after an escalation of arrests associated with street drugs that resulted in overburdened court systems and the emergence of frustration with individuals cycling though the courts in what became know as "the revolving door syndrome." The Reclaiming Futures (RF) model is another intervention that began in 2001 that has attempted to address some of the aforementioned with its emphasis on systems improvements that include: 1) a comprehensive assessment of juvenile offenders; 2) an expanded system of care that coordinates its efforts to serve juvenile offenders; 3) the provision of treatment and services that strengthen youth and their families; 4) a strength- based system of graduated responses that acknowledges prior successes in the treatment process. With Substantial private investments from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation the groundwork was laid to provide support for 10 communities located throughout the United States to begin reinventing the way police, courts, detention facilities, treatment providers, and the community work together to meet this urgent need. These initial efforts (2002-07) largely relied on organizational change and system reform to improve substance abuse interventions for youthful offenders. Although findings of a National evaluation conducted by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Urban Institute, and Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago are encouraging, empirical questions remain that may lead to systems improvements and cost benefits in human capital and related societal costs. The national evaluation used a biannual survey process in each of the communities participating in the initiative. The surveys measured the quality of juvenile justice and substance abuse treatment systems as reported by informants in each community. The pattern of their responses over six survey administrations (December 2003 to June 2006) suggests that RF is a promising strategy for improving substance abuse interventions for youth. However, a more rigorous evaluation is required to substantiate the initial findings purported. These efforts have culminated in a jointly funded initiative in 2009 that was sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), and the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). This jointly funded initiative will continue the efforts to improve outcomes for drug-involved youth in the juvenile justice system by more intentional efforts to combine the structure of a Juvenile Drug Court with the Reclaiming Futures model. Although, each model is significantly different in structure and methods used, they are quite complementary in resolving barriers to change and assisting adolescents in the achievement of recovery, and warrant further investigation as to their combined effects. B. Relationship to current procurements, prior procurements, other Library programs There is a current Interagency Agreement between the Library of Congress Federal Research Division (agreement # 09-12-9699119-016) and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (agreement # 2009-JUR-095) for the procurement of services from the Library of Congress Federal Research Division to fulfill OJJDP's requirement for research reports, translations, and/or other analytical studies related to OJJDP's three sponsored grant programs: 1. Juvenile Drug Courts/Reclaiming Futures, 2. Tribal Juvenile Detention and Reentry Green Demonstrations Program, and, 3. Strategic Enhancement to Mentoring Program. SCOPE OF WORK Problem Statement There are several reasons why the need to provide an empirical base should be established. First, historically significant problems have existed in the availability of quality data, lack of control/comparison groups, the small number of standardized tools in use, and few system-level interventions on the population of interest that have produced the desired outcomes across systems. Second, experts have increasingly recognized the co-occurrence of substance use and mental health disorders that have served to highlight the relative independence of the system of care through which these problems are often addressed or treated. Third, epidemiologic evidence suggests that the majority of substance abusers do not seek treatment for either condition, suggesting systemic issues in the delivery of services and a need for greater system performance and efficiencies. Objectives: The overall purpose for the Juvenile Drug Courts/Reclaiming Futures evaluation is to conduct an independent evaluation of the combined effects of the two interventions to determine what system-level changes may result in increased efficiencies and cost effectiveness. 1. Assess the operations of Juvenile Drug Courts/Reclaiming Futures models using established indices for performance, efficiencies, and cost effectiveness. 2. Improve the empirical knowledge base about Juvenile Drug Courts and the Reclaiming Futures Model. 3. Analyze the efficacy of combined efforts of Juvenile Drug Courts and the Reclaiming Futures Model. 4. Conduct case studies using Administrative, Collaboration, and Quality Indices and the sixteen (16) key elements of Juvenile Drug Courts. 5. Evaluate the potential for replication of these models</span></p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS<br />DATA CENTER EQUIPMENT RELOCATION
<p>DLA Contracting Services Office Philadelphia (DCSO-P) intends to issue a sole source Request for Quotation for Data Center Equipment to be de-installed, packed and moved from Building 2 to Building 7 at the DLA Information Operations -Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The DLA Information Operations Philadelphia located at 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA has Data Center Equipment located in Bldg. 2 that needs to be de-installed, packed and moved to Bldg. 7 for temporary storage until the unit is moved to another DLA Facility sometime in FY11. The contractor shall provide de-installation, packing and transportation services for the equipment for relocation. The transportation will be between two buildings within the DLA Troop Support Center - Philadelphia facility located in Philadelphia, PA.</p>
<p>The subject sole source acquisition to World Wide Technology for Oracle Technical Support services, valued at $49,000.00 will be issued to assure continuation of Oracle Technical Support until the Data Center Equipment is once again in use. Should Oracle Technical Support coverage lapse or packing and relocation be performed by a non-qualified Oracle technician, a technical reinstatement fee equal to 150% of the last paid Oracle support fee will be assessed to re-qualify the Data Center Equipment as service ready.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that this acquisition will not be competed due to the critical need for the incumbent to be retained to continue to provide Oracle Technical Support coverage, avoid a reassessment fee and remove the costly process of re-qualifying the data Center Equipment as service ready. The anticipated award will be for a period not to exceed two weeks while the Data Center Equipment is de-installed, packed and moved to Bldg. 7.</p>
<p>Quotes from firms other than the incumbent will not be considered for award. Performance is anticipated to occur predominantly at the Government's facility. The solicitation is anticipated to be released concurrently and will be emailed directly to the incumbent. The anticipated period of performance is two weeks. Questions should be directed to Peter Monteleone at Peter.Monteleone@dla.mil immediately.</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Such a concern is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity. <br />(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: <br />(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. <br />(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. <br />(3) For long-term contracts- <br />(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and <br />(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter. <br />(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract.

The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. <br />(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. <br />(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: <br />The Contractor represents that it o is, o is not a small business concern under NAICS Code __332911___________ assigned to contract number ______________. <br />[Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title].</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.50 per hour or $140.00 per week or $606.67 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, 4 weeks after 15 years, and 5 weeks after 25 years.<br />Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present<br />contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in<br />the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin<br />Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day,<br />Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and<br />Christmas Day. A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another<br />day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)<br />(See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services on a temporary, on-call, basis as part of the Support Relief Group (SRG).

<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor.

<p>1. Date contractor is needed to report to DCHA/OFDA or assignment in the field<br />2. Duration of Assignment<br />3. Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify DCHA/OFDA within 24 hours of availability. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a disaster may require the assignment to be extended (not to exceed 250 days). The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include but is not limited to Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity. In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field. The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations. SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.</p>
<p>Activation of the Agriculture Advisor will be coordinated with OFDA/TAG. USAID/OFDA activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires an Agriculture Advisor to provide expert technical advice and assistance for the analysis of potential agricultural vulnerabilities and risks and to increase sustainable agricultural capacities at the community level. This person will also be expected to provide expert advice on disaster response and risk reduction strategies for agricultural activities world-wide.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Agriculture Advisor's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct sector-specific assessments and make expert technical recommendations for appropriate activities, both for the initial disaster response phase and for longer-term disaster risk reduction or rebuilding of livelihoods. Assessments may be conducted at the regional, sub-regional, or national level, and may be related to disaster response or to comprehensive strategy development.</p>
<p>&bull; Understanding of the seed security framework, seed system security assessments and how both the framework and assessment information inform emergency programming in the agricultural sector. Apply assessment information to programming decisions.</p>
<p>&bull; At the field level, provide assessments of the agricultural situation as it relates to food security. Assess seed needs and the parameters of the problem, and make expert recommendations to regional teams and Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) on how to best respond to those needs programmatically.</p>
<p>&bull; Actively represent USAID/OFDA in emergency agriculture and food security sector discussions and activities. Serve as a USG emergency agriculture and food security sector resource person.

<p>&bull; Guide OFDA thinking on agriculture and food security activities, and formulate sector strategies and recommendations, both for response and disaster risk reduction, and provide expert technical support for OFDA field offices, other offices within USAID, and to OFDA's Technical Assistance Group (TAG). Exercise independent judgment and decision-making related to agriculture activities, both in the U.S. and in the field.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide expert technical support for OFDA field offices, other offices within USAID, and to OFDA's Technical Assistance Group (TAG) for the agriculture and food security sector.</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate agriculture response and recovery activities across a wide range of actors (UN, NGOs, governments, etc.) to ensure consistency of programming.</p>
<p>&bull; Facilitate and coordinate actual U.S. Government emergency response activities within the agriculture sector with the USAID Mission, other donor agencies, and the U.S. Embassy.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide coordination and managerial oversight of OFDA-funded agriculture activities to ensure the proper use of OFDA program funds.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide technical review of submitted proposals and/or concept notes to ensure that proposed activities and programs align with best practice in the agriculture sector. Apply new developments in the agriculture and food security sector to OFDA programming.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide expert technical support in developing disaster risk reduction programs that mitigate the effects of disasters on populations and communities. Identify disaster mitigation measures that could be linked to disaster response activities. Review disaster risk reduction principles and make expert recommendations on course(s) of action.</p>

During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>2. ISSUANCE DATE: October 22, 2010</p>
<p>3. CLOSING DATE/TIME FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: November 22, 2010 5:00 pm EST</p>
<p>4. POSITION TITLE: Support Relief Group (SRG) - Livestock and Animal Health Advisor</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: GS-14 equivalent ($84,697 - $110,104 - not eligible for locality pay). Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate's past salary, work history and educational background. Salaries over and above the top of the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated.</p>
<p>6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year, with four one-year options</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services on a temporary, on-call, basis as part of the Support Relief Group (SRG). It is the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)'s intent to contract for these services for a maximum of 250 days per calendar year.</p>
<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor. Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, DCHA/OFDA will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Date contractor is needed to report to DCHA/OFDA or assignment in the field<br />2. Duration of Assignment<br />3. Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify DCHA/OFDA within 24 hours of availability. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a disaster may require the assignment to be extended (not to exceed 250 days). The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include but is not limited to Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity. In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field. The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations. SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.</p>
<p>Activation of the Livestock and Animal Health Advisor will be coordinated with OFDA/TAG. USAID/OFDA activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a Livestock and Animal Health Advisor to provide expert technical advice and assistance for the analysis of potential livestock and animal health vulnerabilities and risks and to increase sustainable livestock and animal health capacities at the community level. This person will also be expected to provide expert advice on disaster response and risk reduction strategies for livestock and animal health activities world-wide.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Livestock and Animal Health Advisor's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct sector-specific assessments and make expert technical recommendations for appropriate activities, both for the initial disaster response phase and for longer-term disaster risk reduction or rebuilding of livelihoods. Assessments may be conducted at the regional, sub-regional, or national level, and may be related to disaster response or to comprehensive strategy development.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide expert technical support for OFDA field offices, other offices within USAID, and to OFDA's Technical Assistance Group (TAG). This support should include the use of Livestock Emergency Guidelines and Standards (LEGS) to inform programming and strategies, including providing assistance to OFDA staff on incorporating these standards into implementation.</p>
<p>&bull; Actively represent USAID/OFDA in emergency livestock sector discussions and activities. Serve as a USG livestock and animal health sector resource person, and display expert technical and organizational leadership in sectoral activity commensurate with the role as a primary resource person for emergency livestock and animal health.</p>
<p>&bull; Guide OFDA thinking on livestock and animal health activities, both in pastoralist and settled communities, and formulate livestock and animal health sector strategies and recommendations, both for response and disaster risk reduction. Exercise independent judgment and decision-making related to livestock and animal health activities, both in the U.S. and in the field.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide input to OFDA on animal disease epidemiology, as well as information on livestock-related needs of both pastoralist communities and settled communities.</p>
<p>&bull; Facilitate and coordinate actual U.S. Government emergency response activities within the livestock sector with the USAID Mission, other donor agencies, and the U.S. Embassy.</p>
<p>&bull; Liaise with other humanitarian organizations (UN, NGOs, IOs) and host governments to coordinate OFDA activities within the livestock sector with those of the wider humanitarian community.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide coordination and managerial oversight of OFDA-funded technical activities to ensure the proper use of OFDA program funds.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide technical review of submitted proposals and/or concept notes to ensure that proposed activities and programs align with best practice in the livestock sector. Apply new developments in the emergency livestock sector to OFDA programming.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide expert technical support to develop disaster risk reduction programs that mitigate the effects of disasters on populations and communities. Identify disaster risk reduction measures that could be linked to disaster response activities. Review risk reduction principles and make expert recommendations on course(s) of action.</p>
<p>&bull; Serve on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), Response Management Teams (RMTs) and assessment teams. Responsible for leading teams or for guiding and coordinating the work of other technical staff in the livestock sector.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />During activation, day to day work is under the general supervision of the TAG supervisor. The incumbent will also take administrative direction from and report to the Overseas Administration team leader or his/her designee and the person designated as his/her supervisor in the Staffing Authorization.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The incumbent is expected to take initiative and act independently with little direction and will have a wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment in responding to needs.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>2. ISSUANCE DATE: October 22, 2010</p>
<p>3. CLOSING DATE/TIME FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: November 22, 2010 5:00 pm EST</p>
<p>4. POSITION TITLE: Support Relief Group (SRG) - Economic Recovery and Market Systems Advisor</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: GS-14 equivalent ($84,697 - $110,104 - not eligible for locality pay). Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate's past salary, work history and educational background. Salaries over and above the top of the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated.</p>
<p>6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year, with four one-year options</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services on a temporary, on-call, basis as part of the Support Relief Group (SRG). It is the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)'s intent to contract for these services for a maximum of 250 days per calendar year.</p>
<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor. Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, DCHA/OFDA will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Date contractor is needed to report to DCHA/OFDA or assignment in the field<br />2. Duration of Assignment<br />3. Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify DCHA/OFDA within 24 hours of availability. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a disaster may require the assignment to be extended (not to exceed 250 days). The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include but is not limited to Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity. In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field. The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations. SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.</p>
<p>Activation of the Economic Recovery and Market Systems (ERMS) Advisor will be coordinated with OFDA/TAG. USAID/OFDA activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires an ERMS Advisor to provide expert technical advice and assistance for reducing the interruption and disruption to people's livelihoods and economies following a disaster. The ERMS Advisor is expected to provide expert advice on disaster response and risk reduction strategies for economic activities world-wide by identifying potential vulnerabilities as well as provide strategies to keep economies intact or quickly resume economies following a disaster.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The ERMS Advisor's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct post-disaster market assessments and make expert technical recommendations for appropriate activities, both for the initial disaster response phase and for longer-term disaster risk reduction or rebuilding of livelihoods. Assessments may be conducted at the regional, sub-regional, or national level, and may be related to disaster response or to comprehensive strategy development.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide expert technical support for OFDA field offices, other offices within USAID, and to OFDA's Technical Assistance Group (TAG) for the economic recovery and market systems sector.</p>
<p>&bull; Facilitate and coordinate actual U.S. Government emergency response activities within the economic recovery and market systems sector with the USAID Mission, other donor agencies, and the U.S. Embassy.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide coordination and managerial oversight of OFDA-funded technical activities to ensure the proper use of OFDA program funds.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide technical review of submitted proposals and/or concept notes to ensure that proposed activities and programs align with best practice in the economic recovery and market systems sector. Apply new developments in the ERMS sector to OFDA programming.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide expert technical support to assist in developing disaster risk reduction programs that mitigate the effects of disasters on populations and communities. Identify disaster mitigation measures that could be linked to disaster response activities. Review disaster risk reduction principles and make expert recommendations on course(s) of action.</p>
<p>&bull; Understand the theoretical frameworks that address economic recovery (e.g., the sustainable livelihoods framework, the value chain framework) and with how these frameworks can be operationalized to further economic recovery.</p>
<p>&bull; Actively represent USAID/OFDA in economic recovery sector discussions and activities. Serve as a USG emergency ERMS sector resource person. Display technical and organizational leadership in sectoral activity commensurate with the role as a primary resource person for economic recovery.</p>
<p>&bull; Guide OFDA thinking on ERMS activities, and formulate sector strategies and recommendations, both for response and disaster risk reduction, and provide expert technical support for OFDA field offices, other offices within USAID, and to OFDA's Technical Assistance Group (TAG). Exercise independent judgment and decision-making related to ERMS activities, both in the U.S. and in the field.</p>
<p>&bull; Serve on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), Response Management Teams (RMTs) and assessment teams. Responsible for leading teams or for guiding and coordinating the work of other technical staff in the ERMS sector.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />During activation, day to day work is under the general supervision of the TAG supervisor. The incumbent will also take administrative direction from and report to the Overseas Administration team leader or his/her designee and the person designated as his/her supervisor in the Staffing Authorization.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The incumbent is expected to take initiative and act independently with little direction and will have a wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment in responding to needs.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups. The Shelter and Settlements Sector Advisor is part of the Natural Hazards subgroup.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Shelter and Settlements Sector Advisor is an integral member of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) TAG. USAID/OFDA Shelter and Settlements Sector activities are intended to provide humanitarian shelter in an expeditious and appropriate manner, within a framework based on a settlements approach. The Shelter and Settlements Sector Advisor will help guide OFDA thinking on shelter and settlements sector activities, help formulate shelter sector strategies and recommendations, and help collect and analyze sector-specific information. The individual will also conduct or support studies to examine market conditions for building materials and non-housing portions of the building stock in affected areas. He/she will help integrate other sectoral concerns that are aimed at reducing the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a Shelter and Settlements Sector Advisor who will provide technical assistance in program assessment and planning, specifically related to Shelter and Settlements. This will involve strategy development and implementation, monitoring of Shelter and Settlements Sector activities, providing representation at international forums, and other related activities.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>RRB Specialty MAC (Part B) Pre-solicitation Notice:
<p>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), RRB, as authorized under paragraph 1842(b)(1) of the Social Security Act, must solicit and compete its Part B Medicare Administrative Contractor (Specialty MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain a Specialty MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of RRB in concert with Medicare Program direction from CMS.</p>
<p>The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with professional providers of health care services, for a nationwide "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, and CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program. The Medicare program's legal, policy, and operating environment is complex, and the Contractor will utilize or interact with certain CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will coordinate its activities not only with RRB and CMS, but also with a broad range of agencies (at the federal, state, and local levels of government), other CMS partners and Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders within the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with RRB's technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction and will perform standard or required editing on these claims to determine whether the claims are complete and should be paid. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor calculates Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor may also conduct redeterminations on appeals of claims; operate a Beneficiary and Provider Customer Service Program (BPCSP) that educates providers and beneficiaries about the Medicare program and responds to provider and beneficiary telephone and written inquiries and make compability of payment&nbsp;decisions nationwide. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of different provider services, such as&nbsp;answering written and telephone inquiries, and educating providers on Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.</p>
<p>RRB anticipates releasing a solicitation for this nationwide jurisdiction on or about November 23, 2010. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is January 11, 2011 with an anticipated award date of June 1, 2011.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<DESC>Additonal Questions and Answers<br />1. We are trying to put together pricing and call volume for Langley AFB for<br />Smoking Cessation. We know there are 36,000 beneficiaries at Langley. Do<br />you have any idea of how many are enrolled currently or the approximate<br />number of calls the current contractor is receiving for smoking cessation?
<p>ANSWER: The number of calls on average is 30 per month.</p>
<p>2. What is the estimated call volume per month?</p>
<p>3. What is the typical call times? Meaning, once a Smoking Cessation<br />Expert is on the phone with the patient, how long will it take on average to<br />take care of the patient</p>
<p>ANSWER: #2 The average is 30 per month.</p>
<p>#3 Unknown, we currently only get summaries (SOAP notes).</p>
<p><br />4. After reviewing the RFQ, I need clarification on the size of the population to be served. I just want to make sure I understand the response to the question posted.</p>
<p>Eligible lives at Langley: 7774<br />Number of smokers at Langley: 1,518</p>
<p>Is this correct? I'm thinking it is not based on the $10M size standard. If this program is only for Langley Tri-Care beneficiaries, what vendor are the other Tri-Care beneficiaries using? Would you consider one national vendor for smoking cessation for all Tri-Care?</p>
<p>ANSWER: As previously stated, these number represent the Langley Air Force Active Duty As previously stated, these number represent the Langley Air Force Active Duty total population and current number of tobacco users. Langley Tobacco program services all Tri-Care Beneficiaries in this region. Therefore, it is un realistic to provide a total number of smokers. The total number of beneficiaries serviced is 125,000. Most Air Force bases are using the American Lung Association Quit Line.</p>
<p>We are unable to respond to the last question, we do not have that authority.</p>

There are an estimated 250 guards protecting approximately 110 posts at over 57 buildings.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice is issued for informational and planning purposes only. This is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, or an Invitation for Bids. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract for the items contained in the Sources Sought. In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this Sources Sought, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.<strong> <br /><br />NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

<DESC>Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEF) I, II, and III require shallow water and underwater egress training using the Modular Amphibious Egress Trainer (MAET) and for any future variations as required to train egress from submerged aircraft and submerged vehicles (Submerged Vehicle Egress Trainer  SVET).  The MAET training includes the Shallow Water Egress Training (SWET) techniques and familiarization and operation of the Helicopter Aircrew Breathing Device (HABD), Survival Egress Air (SEA), LPU-32 and newer versions of flotation devices.  This training is for military non-aircrew helicopter passengers and is expandable for accommodating other training platforms, and passengers, as described in this document.
 

The MAET is in life cycle support phase, but has the ability to incorporate other variants for training shallow and underwater egress.  The support is an operation and maintenance program that includes certified instructors, operation of training systems, and preventive, annual, and on-site emergency maintenance of the MAET/SVET devices and related equipment.  A maintenance program for the Helicopter Aircrew Breathing Devices (HABD) and Survival Egress Air (SEA) is also established and include the refurbishment of these devices on a quarterly basis.  There are a total of four training systems installed at major Marine Corps bases; Camp Pendleton, CA, Camp LeJeune, NC, Okinawa, Japan, and Kaneohe Bay, HI.

RELOCATE SENOGRAPHE - GE HEALTHCARE
VISN 17 NETWORK CONTRACTING ACTIVITY
NORTH TEXAS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM - DALLAS, TEXAS

1.	Agency:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Veterans Integrated Service Network 17, Network Contract Activity  for the North Texas Veterans Health Care System (NTVHCS), 7400 Merton Minter Boulevard, San Antonio, TX  78229.
2.	Description of Action:  The NTVHCS intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source basis with the GE HealthCare to relocate the Senographe Essential System from existing location at room 225A, 300 West Rosedale, Fort Worth Texas, 76104 to main pharmacy, 2201 Southeast Loop 820, Fort Worth Texas, 76119.  
3.	Description of Service:  The contractor will provide all labor, tools, materials, transportation and necessary equipment to relocate the Senographe Essential System from existing location at West Rosedale to the new Ft. Worth Outpatient Clinic.  Contractor shall provide the following services:
a.	Coordinate with using service for proper relocation and details of re-installation
b.	Pre-disassembly inspection
c.	De-installation
d.	Transportation of equipment
e.	Reinstallation
f.	Post-installation inspection
The estimated cost of this requirement for the base year and four one-year option periods is $12,160.00.  
4.	Statutory Authority:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2), Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-2, "Unusual and Compelling Urgency"
5.	Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications: GE HealthCare is the manufacturer of the equipment and is the only source that can provide the required service that will not void any warranty requirements on the equipment due to the proprietary nature of the equipment.    Once the machine is relocated, GE HealthCare will be responsible for the disassembly, de-installation of the equipment, transportation and reinstallation and inspection of this equipment.   GE HealthCare will also provide any materials and parts necessary to install the equipment at the new location.
6.	Sources Sought Efforts:  In accordance with FAR Part 5.202(a)(2) synopsis of this requirement is not required based. 
7.	Determination of Price Reasonableness:  The contracting officer will determine the contractor's proposed price to be fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-3(a).
8.	Market Research:  There are no known contracts with the government, and the service required is specific to the manufacturer of the item as they are familiar to the model itself.  There was no one who was listed in GSA or on the internet who had the capability to repair this type of equipment.  As a result of the market research it was determined that only one company could provide the required service 
9.	Other facts:  Failure to have the equipment disassembled, relocated and reinstalled at the new Fort Worth Outpatient Clinic would cause multiple interruptions to patient care as the equipment is essential in providing timely and quality care to eligible beneficiaries.
10.	Listing of Sources:  GE HealthCare, 800 Centennial Ave, Piscataway NJ  08854-3911
11.	Statement of Actions to Remove Barriers to Competition:  The major barrier to competition is the proprietary nature of the GE Healthcare equipment.  There is no other known source that can provide the service to relocate the equipment to the new facility and maintain the manufacturer's warranty.  
12.	Certification:  I hereby certify that any supporting data that is the responsibility of the Technical/Requirements personnel and which forms the basis for this justification is accurate and complete.

To:  Contract File

Subject:  Sterile Processing Microsystem (SPM) Technical Support Upgrade (TSU) Justification & Approval


JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:	

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.303,  justification and approval for other than full and open competition is hereby approved for the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority cited herein.

1.  CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:

Department of Veterans Affairs
Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 5     
849 International Drive, Suite 275
Linthicum, MD 21090

2.  NATURE OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:   This justification and approval is for the award of a sole source contract to Materials Management Microsystems (Contractor) to provide continued Technical Support Upgrade (TSU) maintenance service on its proprietary Sterile Processing Microsystem (SPM) instrument tracking software for the performance period of October 1, 2010 to September 30, 2011.

3. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND SUPPLIES:  

Contractor shall provide continued maintenance service on its proprietary SPM instrument tracking software at Baltimore, Perry Point, Martinsburg and Washington VA Medical Centers. 

Instrument tracking software allows each medical center to more efficiently track the cleaning and use of sterilized supplies and equipment. This service is required for continuity of business function.

Maintenance service would be provided from October 1, 2010 to September 30, 2011.

Services include unlimited telephone customer service assistance, upgrade to software, and access to the password-protected Materials Management Microsystems website. The total contract value is $38,023.

4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY: The requirement will be procured under citation 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(1): Only one responsible source exists and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.  RATIONALE SUPPORTING USE OF AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE:  

The requirement is essential to continue Contractor maintenance of its proprietary SPM instrument tracking software at Baltimore and Washington VA Medical Centers.

Continuation and maintenance of this service is vital to ensure proper tracking of sterile supplies. Staff at Baltimore and Washington VA Medical Centers have been trained extensively in the use of this proprietary SPD software to track cleaning and use of sterilized equipment and supplies. To have to solicit entirely new software and software licenses would result in disruptions to ongoing services and at additional expenses and staff training time for the Government.

The required software license and maintenance services are only available to the Government from Materials Management Microsystems, as their software is proprietary. No other contractor can satisfy VISN 5 requirements for this service.

If VISN 5 and the VA Medical Centers in Baltimore and Washington chose not to have continued maintenance service on the SPM software, it would not receive updates, improved capabilities, and computer bug fixes for the software already acquired. This would result in significant disruption to patient services.

6.  EFFORT TO SOLICIT POTENTIAL SOURCES:  

The contractor was the only source identified, since it has proprietary rights on its software and only the Contractor can provide such maintenance service on its software.

7.  DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  VISN 5 has reviewed and determined that the total contract value of $38,023 is fair and reasonable.

8.  MARKET RESEARCH:  Market research was not conducted, since it was determined that only the Contractor could provide continued maintenance services on its proprietary SPM software.

9.  ADDITIONAL SUPPORT:  N/A

10.  OTHER INTERESTED SOURCES:  N/A

11.  FUTURE COMPETITIVE PLAN:  It is anticipated that the Government will do a competitive acquisition for sterile tracking software over the long term if such a need arises due to the medical centers and VISN 5 needing to have a new, enhanced software package to address significant changes to the processes used in tracking sterilized equipment and supplies.

12.  CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION:  I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
