THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. However, any firm believing itself capable of providing the required software, GT-Suite, may submit appropriate documentation within seven (7) calendar days of electronic posting of this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. Documentation must be submitted in writing to Noah Goldberg via Fax (734)214-4569 or email Goldberg.Noah@epa.gov. Telephone responses will not be honored.

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in sub contracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.

Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division intends to negotiate with Technical Communities, Inc.; San Bruno, CA, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b) - Soliciting from a single source, to purchase an analog signal generator.<br />
<p><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology Applied Electrical Metrology Group/Quantum Measurement Division is responsible for maintaining the U.S. volt and to provide for the dissemination of an internationally consistent, accurate, reproducible, and traceable voltage standard for the U.S. scientific, industrial base and government laboratories. The required acquisition for an Agilent E8257N is the microwave frequency generator to operate the programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS), which provides the highest accurate voltage reference for NIST to disseminate to U.S. industry.  NIST is in the process of implementing the PJVS for research of high precision inter-comparison between JVS systems. The PJVS is required to have a microwave source from 18 GHz and above to drive the Josephson junction array to generate a quantum voltage step.</p>
<p>The Quantum Device Group in Boulder, CO extensively tested several models of microwave generators in the PJVS systems for more than five years.  This testing has shown that this series of microwave generators is 100% compatible with NIST's existing hardware and software. NIST would incur significant costs to adapt a different microwave generator to the existing PJVS system architecture, and could face significant additional costs in the long-term for support of a system that differs from the configuration that has proven its reliability in NIST's lab.</p>
<p>Technical Communities, Inc. has previously been supplying the Agilent E8257N to the DoD's Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) in Mechanicsburg, PA.  Market research has shown that this particular model is not available from any other vendor, including Agilent Technologies.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 334515- Instrument Manufacturing for Measuring and Testing Electricity and Electrical Signals with a size standard of 500 employees.  NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Technical Communities, Inc. for this requirement in the 1st quarter of fiscal year 2014.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Eric Bubar at eric.bubar@nist.gov.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Axeq Technologies, 9700 Great Seneca Highway, Rockville, Maryland 20850 to procure the following:</p>
<p><strong>Procurement:</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a Follow-On Requirement</strong>.</p>
<p>1. Exome Sequencing of 100 Samples, 75-fold sequence coverage at the raw data level in pursuit of 30-fold (30X) on target coverage, with 100-bp paired-end sequencing method.<br />2. Raw data (Fastq) will be provided in hard disk drive.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. It was organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) and the NIH Clinical Center. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program. <br />identified new and rare diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this particular sequencing project is to perform clinical grade quality whole exome sequencing on patient and familial DNA. All data must be produced using the same instrumentation and methodology that the UDP has used thus far in order to allow integration of this data with current databases and analysis using in-house software programs. Genomic DNA will be isolated from all admitted Undiagnosed Diseases patients and family members. Depending on the phenotype of the patient, these DNA samples will be sent for exome sequencing as the first step to obtain variant information that may determine the mechanism of the patients' disease. It is necessary for the Undiagnosed Diseases Laboratory to perform analyses on the exome variant data in a timely manner to facilitate genetic studies when combined with SNP analysis. This information will then be used to perform research experiments to discern the genetic and molecular basis of the unique disease of the patient</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance</strong>:</p>
<p>The contractor will provide 100 DNA samples for Exome sequencing. Sequencing data will be provided on a hard disk drive to the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program in Fastq and BAM forms within 6-8 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTIFICATION:</strong></p>

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>:
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Appistry Inc., 1141 South 7th Street, Suite 300, St. Louis, MO 63104 to procure the following:</p>
<p><strong>BRAND NAME</strong>: (APPISTRY, LARGE APPLIANCE (SOFTWARE)</p>
<p><strong>SEE ATTACHMENT A: IT SECURITY PROVISIONS AND ATTACHMENT B: 508 COMPLIANCE LANGUAGE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Procurement:<br /><br /></strong>1. Ayrris Large Appliance (software only) Annual contract;<br />2. Twelve months managed hosting of Ayrris on up to 512 Nodes;<br />3. UDP Pipeline Development and Integration of Pipeline with RURO LIMS 24/7 with Conversion to BioWolf.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. It was organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) and the NIH Clinical Center. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program. <br />identified new and rare diseases.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA is isolated from all admitted Undiagnosed Diseases patients and family members. Depending on the phenotype of the patient, these DNA samples are sent for exome sequencing as the first step to obtain variant information that may determine the mechanism of the patients' disease. It is necessary for the Undiagnosed Diseases Laboratory to then perform extensive analyses on the large amount of exome sequencing and variant data that is generated in a timely manner to facilitate genetic studies when combined with SNP analysis. This information will then be used to perform research experiments to discern the genetic and molecular basis of the unique disease of the patient. Critical to accomplishing this goal is the use of the diploid alignment methodology developed in the NIH UDP.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>The current use of alignment of NGS short reads to a monoploid canonical reference is successful for the majority of a random individual's genome that has adequate entropy given current sequence lengths and error rates. However, in the absence of other corroborating evidence, the NIH UDP needs a complete survey of the entire genome before committing the resources to validate candidate variant(s). To generate a more complete alignment, the diploid-alignment pipeline uses SNP chips, leveraged with imputation based on 1K genome haplotypes, to modify the canonical reference into two different parental references that are subsequently used to align short reads of an offspring. Time complexity is increased by 3.5X over standard monoploid alignment thereby requiring HPC resources and expertise to provide results in reasonable timeframes.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance</strong>:</p>
<p>Twelve (12) months from the date of award.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTIFICATION:<br /><br /></strong>A. Scope of Work:</p>
<p>NHGRI will establish a collaboration to develop the next generation sequence alignment<br />and genotyping tools that will be available to the research community, including NIH. <br />NHGRI will provide the Contractor the genetic data (SNP chip data and Illumina lane<br />fines (sequence data) from up to sixty (60) patients from the Undiagnosed Diseases<br />Program (UDP. The information is collected with patient consent obtained under<br />Clinical Protocol Number: 76-HG-0238. No personally identifiable information or code<br />to such personally identifiable information will be provided.</p>
<p>The Contractor will integrate Ayrris into NIH CIT Biowulf which will allow all NIH<br />UDP genomic data to remain within the NIH instead of being transferred to an outside<br />data center, which would eliminate the time to transfer data to and from Bethesda and<br />will enable other NIH Biowulf users to leverage the Ayrris computing environment when<br />the Diploid-Alignment is not running.</p>
<p><strong>B. Project:</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor will use the data to implement and refine the processes developed by the NIH UDP for diploid alignment and subsequent genotyping and annotation of next generation sequence data derived from UDP patients.</p>
<p>Information will be provided to the Contractor by secure mail, by encrypted ftp or on an encrypted hard drive. Specifically, the Imation Defender external USB hard drives that provide secure hardware encryption in a tamper-resistant metal closure and use hardware-based encryption of FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated (Certification #1269) will be utilized; this meets federal regulatory requirements for encryption of sensitive, but unclassified data. The Contractor agrees to store the information in a suitably secure and confidential manner that restricts access by any individual not involved in the Research Project. Upon completion of the Research Project the Contract will forward the results and conclusions obtained during the Research Project to NIH/UDP and upon request, destroy or return to NIH/UDP all copies of the information that are in the Contractor's possession. This information may not be used in Human Subject Research.</p>
<p><strong>C. Other considerations</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Ability to use Appistry Inc. Large Appliance.<br />2. Compliance with HIPAA, Safe Harbor and CLIA Regulations.<br />3. Ability to integrate the system in partnership with RuRo Inc., LIMS 24/7 System.<br />4. Must show proof of HIPAA Compliant Encrypted Infrastructure for Storing and Analyzing Protected Health Information (PHI).<br />5. Ability to process more than 1000 exomes in accordance to UDP diploid alignment and genotyping pipeline within 6-months.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY:</strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) as set forth in FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong>:</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541511, Custom Programming Services, small business size standard is $25.5M. . The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).

<p>Full Term: 10 years<br />Firm Term: 5 years<br /><br />The Government is seeking a lease for space with the following requirements:<br /><br />2,068 usf - Office space located on the ground floor and finished space with separate male and female bathroom. Office will include: 250 usf conference room/train; 420 usf Office support; and 48 usf Automated Data Processing<br /><br />1,150 usf - Warehouse, climate-controlled with 10'x10' minimum overhead garage door, with concrete floor and floor drains, water source and stainless steel sink. Ware house will include: 150 usf room that is located 10' of an outside exit door for secure storage of Pesticides/ Firearms/Pyrotechnics; 150 usf lab space for a rabies laboratory with a sink and running water; and 700 usf open work and storage space.<br /><br /><strong>NOTE</strong>: Avoid&nbsp;buildings in close proximity&nbsp;to residential areas because the collection of animal carcasses often creates unavoidable odor problems for neighboring businesses. Geese and other waterfowl are housed overnight and in some cases euthanized along with other animals on-site.<br /><br />5,000 usf - Ware Yard/Outdoor Equipment Storage must be fenced (chain link topped with barbed wire). Covered area 5,000 USF: with 12ft (minimum) high ceiling (metal/aluminum) and a 3-sided siding enclosure. Area will store boats, trailers, ATVs, Cage Traps, wildlife cages, freezers and other equipment. Electrical outlets (Multiple 120V electrical outlets for general use, with at least 12 dedicated circuits for freezers) and running water are needed. Open space is needed in front of the fenced compound to maneuver boats and trailers. Parking lot must have lighting and be fenced to secure 9 Government vehicles (GOVs). Parking surface - Gravel at minimum, blacktop or concrete is preferred with additional room to back/turn vehicles with trailers. This secured parking can be added to and incorporated into the fenced ward yard space.<br /><br /><strong>Parking</strong> - Adequate daily public/parking space is needed for 9 employees which is no more than 1-block away.<br /><br />NOTE: The secured parking for GOVs can be co-located with the ware yard, but the space it occupies should be in addition to the 5,000 usf. It could all be inside the same gated area, but the parking spaces for the 9 vehicles should be in addition to the 5,000 usf covered space.<br /><br />SPECIFICS: In addition to storage of trailers, ATV's, etc. this area will be used for outdoor storage of multiple freezers containing wildlife carcasses for testing. Therefore the space needs to be covered, and at least 1 side of the space needs a wall to protect freezers from rain/snow. Multiple electrical outlets are needed, including at least 12 dedicated 120V outlets for freezers, and a dedicated 30 amp outlet for a camper (RV) plug. An ideal layout would be a wareyard that abuts the office/light industrial building, with a canopy coming off the main building. Ceiling height should be a minimum of 12', and lighting should be available.<br />Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease.<br />&nbsp;<br />A fully serviced lease is required.<br /><br />Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.<br /><br />B. Projected Dates.<br />Offers Due: 03 July 2013<br />Occupancy (Estimated): 08 Dec 2014</p>

These services will supply resources that support a breadth and depth of various missions including but not limited to: intelligence analysis, electronic systems, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Systems, security systems, Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) systems, prototype intelligence hardware/software suites, facilities that are developed, deployed, maintained and repaired at the highest state of readiness, and business functions consistent with Army directives and standards.  <br>  <br> This acquisition establishes and defines the requirements for a comprehensive intelligence services support program.  This contract will support complex, classified, compartmented, and/or unique ground-based and airborne reconnaissance and electronic intelligence collection and production systems.  The Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity Performance Work Statement (PWS) establishes a comprehensive and integrated approach to providing support to the intelligence mission that evolves from multiple current disparate IC support services contracts.  A single acquisition will lead to multiple contracts that will provide for the competitive placement of task orders to meet current and future Army Intelligence, Security, and Information Operations requirements.  The support services under this contract include the following areas:  (1) intelligence and security operations; (2) information operations; (3) mission support for facilities management, logistics, training, and intelligence systems support; and (4) sustainment services including program management, strategic planning, administrative and requirements analysis.  This IDIQ contract will primarily support INSCOM units/sites and Department of the Army requirements worldwide and  IC mission partners who conduct integrated operations with INSCOM .   <br>  <br> This requirement is full and open, with a partial ceiling of 30% set-aside to United States Small Businesses. The Government anticipates award of multiple IDIQ contracts with a five (5) year ordering period, however, it reserves the right to make no award or to make a single award, if in the best interest of the Government.. The guaranteed minimum is anticipated to be $5,000.00 for each award. Task orders will typically have a one (1) year base period and two option periods.    Offerors are hereby notified that INSCOM support contractors (not competing for this requirement) may be advisors to the evaluation panel, and by submitting a proposal, the offeror is consenting to such.   <br>  <br> All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. <br>  <br> Upon release of the request for proposals, INSCOM will post technical data on the acquisition's reading room (http://www.inscom.army.mil/Contracting/GI.aspx?text=off&size=12pt), to assist interested parties in the formulation of their proposal(s).  <br>  <br> Place of Contract Performance: Worldwide.  <br>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following services under project number 660-15-103 - Replace HVAC in Building 9 and 13 at the George E. Wahlen VA Medical Center (VAMC), Salt Lake City, Utah.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330. 

The Salt Lake City VA Medical Center is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to provide all A/E services for Two of the existing roof top Air Handling Units (AHU's) in B. 9, the B. 13 AHU's, and associated pumps, piping, ductwork and controls are all well past their life expectancy and are a constant drain on the maintenance budget both in parts and the labor to maintain the systems in a state of proper operation.  As a result we are requesting an A/E's services to evaluate the existing systems and the spaces they serve and to design replacement HVAC systems (equipment, controls ducts, etc.) as appropriate to bring the buildings/supported areas into compliance with the current appropriate VA HVAC requirements.  The design support will include the development of drawings and specifications that will comprise the construction documents.  All provisions for project review, construction coordination, construction period services, and as built documentation will be part of the design services.

The AE firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired construction work.   Microsoft Project scheduling and management software will be used by both the A&E and Contractors to allow for regular tracking of schedules and work by the VAMC.   Schedules with MS Project will be regularly sent to the COR upon project initiation and whenever significant changes occur in the schedule.  All work must be designed within a construction cost range of $500,000 to $1,000,000.  Progressive design documents are as follows:  Schematic Design Documents (35%), Design Development Documents (65%), and Biddable Construction Documents (95%).  It is required that the A/E hold progress review meeting with the VA at each of the three stages of document submission.   The A/E shall provide plans and a cost estimate for the Schematic submittal and plans, specifications and a construction cost estimate for the DD and CD stages for the VA to review.  The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the AE to minimize impact of the construction.  The AE will provide documents at each submission as indicated in the statement of work.  The NAICS code for this project is 541330.  The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do, type in 330 in the "Find A Form" block and click on search. 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330.  Interested firms should submit one (1) copy of their current SF 330 no later than 12:00 PM Mountain Standard Time (MST) January 6, 2014 to andrew.stigen@va.gov. The emailed file shall not exceed 5MB in total.  

Offerors will be evaluated on the following criteria:
(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;
(2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials;
(3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;
(4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;
(5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and
(6) Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.
(7) Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.
(8) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team

<DESC>This is a sources sought for commercial&nbsp;finite element analysis (FEA) modeling software. &nbsp; The purpose for this posting is to perform market research for a governmental need.&nbsp; Please review the description of the need below and if your firm is able to meet the requirement, please submit a quote to Jonathan Stone at <a href="mailto:jonathan.stone@wpafb.af.mil">jonathan.stone@wpafb.af.mil</a>.&nbsp; Quotes are due by 12 noon Tuesday, December 24, 2013.<br /><br /><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br />The&nbsp;FEA modeling software for elastic wave simulation represents an essential component of AFRL/RXCA computational nondestructive evaluation (NDE) research activities. The FEA modeling environment must provide a capability for simulating complex ultrasound sensor and ultrasound sensing physics in virtual and realistic aerospace material systems, where coupled electrical-mechanical-acoustic-thermal problems must be solved explicitly. The software must provide an accurate time-domain solution for large elastic wave propagation problems in complex material systems (&gt;50 million elements), with specific capabilities for modeling mid- to high-frequency ultrasonic regimes (25kHz - 50MHz).
<p>The software must be able to model ultrasonic damping in solids, fluids, and viscoelastic materials (volumetric and shear damping), and must be able to model nonlinear material interactions. The software must provide accurate modeling capabilities for ultrasound sensors involving electro-mechanical materials such as piezoelectric ceramics, and the capability for simulating electrical circuits for impedance matching and sensor cabling. The software must provide full-matrix, time-history field variable capture to include xyz displacements, velocities, stress, strain, pressure, electric fields for discrete elements/nodes, and also provide integrated piezoelectric sensor voltage response for realistic sensor configurations (piezoelectric crystals, electrodes, damping materials, coupling materials).</p>
<p>The software must be capable of accurately representing advanced aerospace structures and materials, such as carbon fiber composites, polycrystalline materials, and hybrid anisotropics. The software must provide a means for interactively working with save data sets to include frequency analysis, data plotting and animation, and advanced signal analysis (e.g. time-shifting, scaling, differentiation, integration, and extrapolation).</p>

<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend contract NAS2-02090 with Lockheed on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  The performance period will be extended for eight (8) month period of performance, consisting of one 4-month base period and four 1-month options. &lt;p&gt; The principle purpose of this contract is to support science, space, exploration efforts through discrete programs and projects.  At NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) the Programs and Projects Directorate conducts and manages programs, projects and develops and executes missions.  Support requirements span multiple Directorates at ARC, other NASA Centers and NASA Headquarters.	In order for the various Directorates to develop, manage, and execute programs within its mission area, research and development is required in the areas of Program Management, Project Management, Program Support, Collaborative Technologies, Engineering, Hardware and Software Systems Engineering and Educational Outreach. &lt;p&gt; The extension of the period of performance of the current contract, NAS2-02090, will be for eight (8) months, consisting of one 4-month base period and four 1-month options from February 1, 2014 through May 31, 2014, for the base period; and end on September 30, 2014, if all four 1-month options are exercised.   The extension will require an increase in the current contract value.	The extension is the Governments best interest to provide ongoing Programs and Projects services until a new contract is awarded.  The current Contractor, Lockheed Martin is considered the only Contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short period of performance for the extension.	The four (4) month extension with four (4) 1-month options is necessary to maintain the critical continuity of support services until the current procurement process for the follow-on contract has been completed and a new contract awarded. &lt;p&gt; The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  &lt;p&gt; This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>FEMA is soliciting the information from qualified providers to provide information on software that may meet or exceed current software requirements.</p>
<p>The current remote-server software is used to initiate and monitor activity occurring on blade servers executing HP/QTP automation scripts that provide production support to FEMA response and recovery programs and other government agencies for the purpose of processing large volumes of critical registration/applicant casework and project-specific tasks. As such, this software allows FEMA staff to efficiently and effectively initiate, view and monitor a variety of processes simultaneously executing on these workstations at any given time.</p>
<p>The current remote-server software and automation tool configuration simulates actual users working on a PC computer in real time as if using the PC's keyboard and mouse. One can remotely access the remote workstation from multiple locations, using view-only and full-control mode. The current remote-server software provides the capability to manipulate a remote computer and as well as restart the remote machine.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br />This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources that includes; (1) other than small businesses (large businesses, education institutions, non-profits, etc.); (2) small business sources; (3) HubZone small businesses; (4) service-disabled small businesses; (5) veteran-owned small businesses; (6) 8(a) small businesses; (7) veteran-owned small businesses; (8) woman-owned small businesses; (9) small disadvantaged businesses; and (10) private contractors and consultants, who can perform the requirements of the size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code as specified below.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. The notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a small business social-economic set-aside, competitive or non-competitive method is possible, and to determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>ALL organizations with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</strong><br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services and the associated small business size standard of $14.0 million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Background Information:</strong><br />Racial and ethnic minority populations, including African Americans, American Indian/Alaska Natives, Asian American/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics, have long been underrepresented in biomedical and clinical research. Underrepresented minority researchers face a number of challenges that influence their success in obtaining funded research support from NIDA/NIH and from other federal funding agencies.</p>
<p>A recently-commissioned NIH study found that Black applicants from 2000-2006 were 10 percentage points less likely than white applicants to be awarded NIH research project grants (Ginther, et al, 2011).  Some of the challenges identified in this study as well as in previous literature include limited/poor mentoring, limited access to research resources and mentoring during training, lack of knowledge of research funding opportunities and requirements, and limited resources. Furthermore, a decline in research funding has led to increased competition overall resulting in fewer funded grant applications for federal support. These factors have severely impacted NIDA's efforts to increase and retain independent underrepresented minority investigators conducting substance abuse and addiction research.</p>
<p><strong>Project Description:</strong><br />The Office of Diversity and Health Disparities (ODHD), Office of the Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), seeks input from established organizations or institutions on new and innovative activities and/or efforts that will effectively increase NIDA's recruitment and retention of independent funded investigators from racial and ethnic minority populations, including African Americans, American Indian/Alaska Natives, Asian American/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics into the area of substance abuse research.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is intended to solicit organizations and or institutions for a description of innovative activities and/or efforts to improve NIDA's recruitment and retention of independent funded investigators from all racial and ethnic underrepresented minority populations, including African Americans, American Indian/Alaska Natives, Asian American/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics into substance abuse research. Activities may include mentoring and research development programs, career development activities for early-stage investigators or assistant professors which will lead to independent grant support, or other programs which have a proven track record of success in training and developing underrepresented minorities in research careers.  Information on how activities and programs will be tracked, reported, and evaluated should be included as well as details on the evaluation, success rates and documenting practices of past career development programs.  Respondents should demonstrate their ability to attract each of these different population groups, sensitivity to each group's unique needs and challenges, and knowledge of health disparities research as it relates to each population.</p>
<p>Additionally, information is sought on evaluating the current body of research and providing recommendations on gap areas requiring additional attention, as it relates to substance abuse/addiction health disparities research for each population.  For example, there are differences in the consequences of drug use for racial/ethnic minorities, which creates a need to better understand the unique prevention, treatment, and health services needs of these communities through health disparities research.  Understanding differences in the mechanisms of action and pharmacological effects of drugs of abuse is vital to treating different populations.  Deliverables may include literature reviews or manuscripts documenting the current state of substance abuse research and/or gap areas as it relates to health disparities research, posters and/or presentations at scientific meetings, or other reports that detail and document the areas additional efforts are needed to address the specific needs of different racial or ethnic populations may be proposed.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statement:</strong><br />Contractors that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this work should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the Contracting Officer. The capability statement must specifically address the project requirement. The capability statement should include 1) the contractor's business size, socioeconomic status, and/or the total number of employees, 2) a demonstration of the contractor's ability to advertise and recruit appropriate populations at the national level, 3) a documented track record for training the desired populations, 4) a demonstration of the means to evaluate the contractor's activities, and have outcomes to demonstrate that they have made significant progress toward increasing the number of funded underrepresented minority scientists, 5) a demonstration of the contractor's ability to recruit and train all populations of underrepresented scientists, 6) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training, 7) examples of prior completed projects of similar nature and 8) any other information considered relevant to this program. The capability statement must not exceed 15 single sided pages in length and using a 12-point font size minimum.</p>
<p>Interested organizations are required to identify their size standards in accordance with the Small Business Administration. The Government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in a response to this notice. However, responses that indicate the information therein is proprietary will be properly safeguarded for Government use only. Capability statements must include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will be considered non-responsive. When submitting this information, please reference the solicitation notice number.</p>

<p>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government from an ultimate acquisition approach. This synopsis is not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. Requests for solicitation will not receive a response. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any input as a result of this market survey. The U.S. Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey.</p>
<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NSWC IHEODTD) is seeking companies who have an existing commercial product that is equivalent to the PVU-1/A, PVU-2/A, PVU-7/A Primers as described herein. Applicable sections of the MIL-STD-105, 129, 453, and 1168 may apply. Testing of the finished primer for suitability is conducted per WS21535, WS21579, and WS23835.</p>
<p>Manufacturing of these primers requires extensive background in the handling, processing and loading of extremely sensitive compositions containing primary explosives. Primer compositions also contain toxic chemicals (salts of lead, barium, and antimony). Primary explosives are not generally commercially available and must be either manufactured on site or procured, if possible, from a primer manufacturer. Primary (or initiating) explosives must be shipped and stored separately. Requirements imposed on the use, shipping, handling, hazards and monitoring/protection of personnel see the DOD Contractor's Safety Manual (DOD 4145.26) or OP-5 (as appropriate) and 40 CFR (EPA), 29 CFR (OSHA), and 49 CFR (DOT). Other regulations may also apply. A DCAS site safety inspection may also be required. The manufacturer must also have the chemical analysis capabilities to analyze the composition (for formulation, stability, etc.). Further, the proper performance testing of the primers requires the ability to do in process conformance testing to maintain the process contrails required to make a homogeneous primer lot over the several days needed (using traditional labor intensive processes). The facilities used in production (storage, mixing, drying, loading, testing) must conform to appropriate standards for handling explosives (grounding, explosion proof electrical components, shielding, etc.). Technical expertise is required to sustain quality throughout all phases of the manufacturing process and an established internal quality control system is also required.</p>
<p>All responding sources shall provide a summary of their company's capabilities including organization name, address, a description of facilities and/or equipment, manufacturing processes, inspection capability, personnel, past experience, and current production capacity per month. Since ability to test these primers requires access to explosives, conformance to local, state and federal laws, regulations and appropriate safety and security measures must be demonstrated, as well as the ability to obtain appropriate permits and site zoning.</p>
<p>It is also required to provide a point of contact, phone number, fax number, mail address, business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number and CAGE Code.</p>
<p>All responding sources must submit their responses no later than 13 January 2014 to:</p>

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />Federal Communications Commission<br />Office of the Managing Director</p>
<p><br />1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The Office of the Managing Director (OMD), in support of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), is seeking information on the design, build, operation and maintenance (to include ongoing improvement) of a Video Access Technology Reference Platform (VATR) to facilitate the provision of Video Relay Service (VRS), Internet Protocol Relay Service (IP Relay), and Internet Protocol Captioned Telephone Service (IP CTS). Specifically, the OMD wants to identify sources that can do the work. Additionally, we seek industry's input into the feasibility of the planned scope of work, as well as, a rough order of magnitude as it relates to cost and schedule.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a solicitation or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supplies or services whatsoever. Further, the FCC is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept or review unsolicited proposals. Vendors are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if and / or when any are issued. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>Please note that current certified TRS providers, current employees of TRS providers, and companies that staff current employees of TRS providers should not respond to this RFI.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>2.1 The FCC, as set forth in Structure and Practices of the Video Relay Service Program, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,Telecommunications Relay Services and Speech-to-Speech Services for Individuals with Hearing and Speech Disabilities, CG Docket Nos. 10-51, 03-123, 28 FCC Rcd 8618 (2013) (VRS Reform Order), is seeking information to aid in the development of a solicitation for the creation and ongoing administration, as described herein, of the VATR platform using open source or off-the-shelf technology to the maximum extent practical.</p>
<p>2.2 Planned Production: It is the intent of the FCC to have a VATR in testing no later than (NLT) 3 months after contract award and a fully operational VATR within 6 months of contract award.</p>
<p>2.3 Security Requirements: The VATR must maintain Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) compliance, as well as sufficient safeguards to maintain the proprietary or personal nature of the information in its possession and shall protect such information from theft, loss, or misuse (where those aren't already covered by FISMA or the Privacy Act of 1964).</p>
<p><br />3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>3.1 As stated in 1.1. above, the OMD wants to contract for a VATR that can be used to make and receive VRS, IP Relay, and IP CTS calls, as well as "point-to-point" calls directly between Internet-based TRS users. The OMD is also considering whether the VATR should be built on open source hardware and/or software and whether commercial or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment, technology, or services are suitable. The VATR is to be an application based system that is interoperable with existing certified VRS provider platforms, but that provides a quality of service that at a minimum is on par with the "best platforms" on the market. The OMD is seeking input into the following:</p>
<p>3.1.1 How would the use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Open Source solutions impact the cost to build and operate or the overall quality of the platform? Please elaborate.</p>
<p>3.1.2 If the FCC were to take ownership of the rights to any solution offered to fulfill this contract, what would be the impact to: 1) your desire to bid, or 2) the cost of your bid?</p>
<p>3.1.3 Which of the following options for building the VATR platform appear to you as most likely to ensure successful completion:<br />(1) Your company provides a ready-to-run system?<br />(2) Your company works with a value-added reseller or a subcontractor to integrate the system and provide the VRS-specific features?<br />(3) Your company provides hardware and/or software components that are then integrated and enhanced by a third party as a separate FCC contract?</p>
<p>3.1.5 What are the technical considerations/challenges the FCC should be consider when developing the requirements for the VATR?</p>
<p>3.1.6 Should the VATR conduct validation of a user's eligibility and geographic location (a) directly with the iTRS-URD or (b) via the NCP?</p>
<p>3.1.7 The Commission seeks to understand the Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of the cost and schedule for 1) development of the platform and 2) the annual cost for tech support plus periodic updates/upgrades to this platform.</p>
<p>3.1.8 What your recommended approach to updating and/or modifying the VATR as standards and regulations evolve if the goal is to maintain a leading edge system for providing VRS? What is your annual ROM for the effort?</p>
<p>3.2 Finally, what else should the Commission consider pertaining to this acquisition?</p>
<p>4.0 Responses</p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.</p>

<p>3.1.3 Is it reasonable to assume that a single company can both build and operate the system? If not, how can the FCC ensure direct access to the developers in the development phase and the operators during the operations phase, when two or more companies are filling those roles, without having to go through one company to get to the other?</p>
<p>3.1.4 Which of the following options for building the NCP appear to you as most likely to ensure successful completion:<br />(1) Your company provides a ready-to-run system?<br />(2) Your company works with a value-added reseller or a subcontractor to integrate the system and provide the VRS-specific features?<br />(3) Your company provides hardware and/or software components that are then integrated and enhanced by a third party as a separate FCC contract?</p>
<p>3.1.5 What are the technical considerations/challenges the FCC should be considering when developing the requirements for the system?</p>
<p>3.1.6 Should the verification and validation of a user's eligibility and geographic location occur within: a) this platform or b) within the iTRS User Registration Database (iTRS-UDR)? <br />3.1.6.1 Additionally, should it occur on a per call basis or only upon initiation of the VATR platform?<br />3.1.6.2 Finally, if the verification and validation occurs within the iTRS-URD or is split between the iTRS-URD and the NCP; should the VATRP talk directly to the iTRS-URD or should it route through the NCP?</p>
<p>3.1.7 The Commission envisions technical support for stand-alone Call Assistance (CA) providers and other VRS providers through a 24x7 network operations center (NOC) that can be reached by phone, email, and a trouble ticket system for service outages; as well as technical support, including a ticketing system, for issues of a lesser impact and urgency, such as interoperability or performance problems. Would your recommended solution for providing technical support, align with the description above, or do you recommend a different approach? What would you recommend for VRS end users?</p>
<p>3.1.8 How would you propose to implement the appropriate processing of emergency calls, specifically, the functionality necessary to comply with 47 C.F.R &sect; 64.605(b)?</p>
<p>3.1.9 The Commission seeks to understand the Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of the cost and schedule for the development of the platform, as well as the annual cost for operating and maintaining this platform.</p>
<p>3.1.10 What your recommended approach to updating and/or modifying the VATR as standards and regulations evolve if the goal is to maintain a leading edge system for providing VRS? What is your annual ROM for the effort?</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Operational Test Command, Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate (ABNSOTD) intends to award a sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii) to TREX Enterprises to develop new capabilities in the existing Geometric Automated Video Location System (GAVELS), produce GAVELS hardware and software for the ABNSOTD, and to provide GAVELS sustainment support for all GAVELS systems at ABSOTD and FIRES Test Directorate (FTD). This contract will develop the capability for the existing GAVELS-NVC to track paratroopers.  Upon completion of the development, the upgraded system consisting of eight Data Collection Systems, one Data Reduction System, a Remote Control System and all system software will be delivered to ABNSOTD.   Period of performance for the IDIQ contract is 36 months from date of award.  The system development and production Task Order period of performance will be 12 months after the date of the Task Order award.  Period of performance for the sustainment will be 36 months after the date of the Task Order award via one or more Task Orders.  Total estimated cost for this effort is approximately $2,789,490 for the upgrade development and production, and $299,940 for three (3) years of sustainment of all GAVELS fielded systems.  The minimum expenditure on the contract is estimated to be $2,789,490 and the maximum $3,089,430.  The current GAVELS systems were awarded competitively to TREX under contract W9115U-11-C-0003 and the government requires enhanced systems capabilities to meet mission essential needs.   FTD and ABNSOTD at times share GAVELS assets.  For this reason, it is imperative that the FTD and ABNSOTD systems be compatible.  To accomplish both the required upgrades and the sustainment a vendor would require access to the GAVELS system tracking software code.  This software and its code is proprietary to TREX.  The government does not have licensing or other data rights.  Without this code a vendor cannot accomplish the work required to design, test and install upgrades and perform sustainment work on the GAVEL systems to ensure uniformity of performance and operation.  The NAICS code is 334220 with a size standard of 750. The proposed contract action is for end items for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability by responding to this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government will only consider the capability submissions received within fifteen days after date of publication of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be used only for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may identify interest and capability by responding to this synopsis.  All respondents must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and have a valid DUNS number, Cage Code, and Tax Identification Number. All responses must be written and sent via electronic mail to the Government point of contact for this announcement angelic.m.hatcher.civ@mail.mil.  The Government will not accept telephone inquiries or responses.

<SUBJECT>Seminoe Dam Alkli-Silca Reaction (ASR) Analysis
<SOLNBR>R14PS800001
<RESPDATE>010214
<CONTACT>Judith Chamberlin, Contract Specialist, Phone (303) 445-2606, Email jchamberlin@usbr.gov
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisition Operations Branch, Denver, Colorado, intends to award on a sole-source basis to Hatch Acres Corporation, 100 Sylvan Parkway, Suite 200, Buffalo, NY 14228. This analysis and modeling requirement is to update the Seminoe Dam structural analysis model utilizing GROW3D software <br />for static and seismic loadings in order to understand the current and future state of the stresses in the dam, given the continuation of alkali-silica reaction (ASR) since the last analysis.
<p>Seminoe Dam is a concrete arch dam located on the North Platte River about 31 miles northeast of Rawlings, Wyoming. This dam was completed in 1939 with a structural height of 295 feet, a hydraulic height of 206 feet, a crest length of 530 feet at elevation 6361.0 and a total concrete volume of 210,000 yd3. The reservoir, containing over 1,000,000 acre-feet at elevation 6357 (top of active conservation) provides water storage for irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, and recreation.</p>
<p>Seminoe Dam is experiencing concrete expansion, cracking and deterioration due to ASR and freeze-thaw damage. Alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR) is a general term for reactions in concrete which occur between certain types of aggregate and the alkalis in the cement which forms a silica gel or carbonate reaction products. ASR is the specific chemical reaction between the alkalis in Portland cement and silica or silicates in the aggregate in the presence of moisture which forms a hydrophilic expansive gel. The gel absorbs moisture and swells which results in cracking and expansion of concrete structures. The reactive aggregate at Seminoe Dam has been identified as strained quartz which was the coarse aggregate used in the concrete.</p>
<p>All modeling and conclusions developed in previous studies are applicable to efficiently update this current analysis which will also incorporate current information. The analysis shall incorporate updated concrete tests and instrumentation data. The results of the updated structural analysis and modeling will be used in a risk analysis.</p>
<p>The authority for use of other than full and open competition for this transaction is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Hatch Acres Corporation has the Seminoe Dam model and study data from studies performed in January 2001, December 2003, May 2004, April 2005 and January 2008 utilizing the GROW3D finite element model.</p>
<p>This procurement shall be awarded using FAR Part 36 Architect-Engineer Services procedures, NAICS code 541330, with an intended period of performance ending September 30, 2015. Anticipated award date is January 30, 2014.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement by 12:00 pm MST, January 2, 2014, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this notice and responses to this notice shall be submitted to Judy Chamberlin, Contract Specialist, via e-mail to jchamberlin@usbr.gov.</p>

NOAA's fleet currently has 28 POS/MV 320 V4 systems installed and has 28 licensed instances of POSView software in use, and has a continued requirement to access technical support and program updates for this essential firmware and software. Without the purchase of the yearly software support agreement and warranty, NOAA users would not have access to necessary updates and support for continued quality data acquisition. NOAA's fleet currently owns 28 licenses of POSView software that must be kept under annual software maintenance. This provides upgrades and patches that improve or add software functionality, as well as fixing any potential security issues that may arise. Applanix, LLC is the sole provider of support and maintenance and upgrade capabilities for its firmware and software. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System code for this acquisition is 334511 with a corresponding size standard of 750 employees.

Responses must be faxed to Maria Mendoza at (206)527-7513 or provided by e-mail to maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov. This is a simplified acquisition. <br /><br />**** This procurement also requires contractors to complete the electronic representations and certifications at the SAM website. All vendors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM). NO award can be made unless the vendor is registered in SAM.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development in Afghanistan (USAID/Afghanistan) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (as authorized in AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5)) with Black and Veatch Special Projects Corporation (BVSPC), 6601 College BLVD, Overland Park, KS 66211, USA for the procurement of Technical Support Services for the installation and commissioning of Kajaki Dam Generating Unit 2 in Afghanistan. The construction and management contract for Unit 2 installation and commissioning will be awarded by Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS), the national electric utility of Afghanistan, to an international firm. BVSPC will provide technical support services to USAID, DABS and the international firm for the installation and commissioning of Unit 2; especially on all project documentation pertaining to Unit 2 Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), and on Kajaki Hydropower Plant design and installation issues.<br /><br />Under its contract with USAID, BVSPC prepared the Final Kajaki Dam Unit 2 Hydro Inventory and Condition Assessment Report dated 31 January 2012, as revised. Given this report as well as BVSPC's prior work on Kajaki Unit 2, BVSPC is well positioned and qualified to provide the required technical support. BVSPC has completed a significant portion of the engineering design drawings required for the Unit 2 installation and developed an extensive inventory and condition assessment report on the GFE at the project site while implementing its contract with USAID. No firm other than BVSPC has this specialized knowledge and technical information which was gathered during BVSPC's work on-site at Kajaki and, therefore, BVSPC reflects the best value to the government.
<p>This announcement constitutes the notice required by FAR 5.201. Interested parties may identify their interest by submitting a capability statement, proposal or quotation to the point of contact listed above. This Special Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes.

Box 190022, North Charleston SC 29419-9022  Description Request for Information (RFI)  Information pertaining to sociological and psychological disparity of knowledge of crowd situations whether violent or non-violent within multiple cultures. DUE: January 24, 2014  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Atlantic, Innovation and Discovery Competency (71000) is seeking information to include research studies with associated documentation (i.e. professional papers, journals), database systems information, points of contact (POCs) who possess or have access to information, and/or software pertaining to sociological and psychological disparity of knowledge of crowd situations whether violent or non-violent within multiple cultures.  All information should be relevant to the following:  1.  Conflict drives people from their homes to other parts of their countries or to other surrounding countries.  Demographics change rapidly throughout the Middle East and North Africa.  What are the cultural, behavioral and communications changes within the new demographics and what are the elements to crowd development, cohesion and dispersion?  2.  Assess behavior, psychological, social, and cultural norms of Middle Eastern and North African persons in differing environments through verbal and non-verbal communication patterns in high conflict areas.  Factors associated with crowds that are not well understood especially within culturally diverse groups requiring consideration:   How are the groups organized and what is the hierarchical structure of the groups?   The levels of violence from non-violent and associated reasoning for escalation versus de-escalation.   What are the sociological and psychological factors that may contribute to violent behavior in crowds?  What types of behaviors are elicited by levels of violence?   What are some of the contributing factors to crowd behavior to include: leader involvement, social media, visual, local media, cultural specific, particular situations, etc.?   What crowd-control techniques are most effective in preventing and stopping violent behavior?  Is there any real data to validate specific control techniques outside of controls used within Western environments?   What are the specific gender and age issues?  It is important to get away from Western ideas of sociological and psychological theorem and patterns and conduct a greater research effort in analysis of these areas within specific culturally diverse populations. Obtaining information from NGOs, human terrain cultural data collection agencies, and from education professionals, sociologists and psychologists from specific cultures would be most beneficial.  The RFI results will be used to assess the cultural understanding of crowd development and dispersion within high conflict areas, specifically, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and the African Sahel to include the Sudans and Somalia.  Specific information sought includes:   Lists of documents pertaining to the research queries stated previously: professional papers, journals, books, etc.  If documents can be acquired without purchase, request those items be emailed to Ms. Terresa Jackson according to Submittal requirements stated below.   Data base systems information with points of contact for accesses, if necessary.  If corporate or government agency, need information on the company including name, URL, mailing address, email and phone.   Simulation environments software or online URLs with points of contact for accesses, if necessary.   Brief description of system's features, capabilities, performance, and availability.   Technology Readiness Level (TRL) with a brief description of system state of readiness or availability. This should include statements on demonstrated or evaluated performance.   Cost information on those items that require purchase such as licensing, price and General Services Administration (GSA) schedule information if available.  Submittals The technical point of contact is Terresa Jackson at terresa.jackson@navy.mil. Please provide documentation packages to Ms. Jackson via the US Army's ARMDEC SAFE transfer site (https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/SAFE2/).  Acceptable submission formats include Microsoft Word and/or pdf.  Large (> 5Mb) data packages will not accepted by Navy email.  ARMDEC SAFE is certified to FOUO and will accept data file transfers up to 2 GB total and 25 (zip) files. Documentation packages should be appropriately marked for distribution/dissemination rights (i.e., FOUO, etc.).  DVDs and/or CDs of free software may be mailed to the following address:  Terresa Jackson 5215 Timberhurst San Antonio, TX 78250  All submissions should be provided no later than 12:00 PM CST, 24 January 2014.  Technical questions, issues, etc. may be directed to Ms. Jackson via email.  This RFI is for information gathering and planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer. The Government DOES NOT intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  E-mail your non-technical contract related questions to the Contract Specialist at christopher.m.brown5@navy.mil.

<DESC>The FY14 Medical Practice Initiative Team Communications Training Research (MPI-TCT) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeks to advance the state of research under the MPI initiative. The MPI-TCT BAA is being offered for the first time in FY14. The MPI is primarily focused on the research and, ultimately, the development of medical training methods, technologies, systems, and competency assessment tools for the attainment and sustainment of military medical readiness. The MPI advances these goals through research and development projects related to the practice of medicine. The primary purpose of the MPI-TCT BAA is to solicit research that will improve communication skills and team performance in medical settings with the goal of reducing medical errors and improving medical care. Research funded through the MPI-TCT BAA is intended and expected to benefit and inform both military and civilian medical practice and knowledge. Results are expected to inform the Government (DOD and civilian agencies) on the potential viability of a software simulation, technology and/or programming gaps, and on evaluation criteria and/or metrics to improve performance in this domain. This announcement is soliciting research into methods and technology that would support future development of a prototype medical communications skills and/or medical team performance team-training simulation system. Under this announcement, a proof of concept or prototype of the proposed technical high risk work is being sought. A prototype system that undergoes validation may be proposed and developed, provided that it is supported by critical research and analysis of data regarding the nature and extent of improving communication skills and team performance in medical settings that a prototype purports to address and it is supported by valid metrics that support efficacy.  The full announcement and submission instructions are located at Grants.gov.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation.<br />The United States Coast Guard Academy (USCGA) is committed to strengthening the nation's future by educating, training and developing leaders of character who are ethically, intellectually, professionally, and physically prepared to serve their country and humanity, and who are strong in their resolve to build on the long military and maritime heritage and proud accomplishments of the United States Coast Guard. The USCGA requires current, qualified underrepresented minority cadet leads to reach its strategic enrollment goals.<br /><br />Nature of Acquisition: In order to carry out the institutional strategic priority regarding a community of inclusions, the United States Coast Guard Academy (USCGA)- Admissions Division- must enroll qualified underrepresented minority students. According to propensity studies conducted by the Joint Advertising Market Research and Studies (JAMRS) group, the total number of college bound, underrepresented minorities, interested in military service is a small fraction of the overall population bound for college. The National Research Center for College &amp; University Admissions (NRCCUA) is the most comprehensive source for identifying and reaching out to this highly targeted market. Specifically, NRRCUA will: <br />&bull; Provide in-class surveys to nearly six million students in over 22,000 public and private high schools <br />&bull; Provide an on-line version of the survey available to the balance of U.S. high school students<br />&bull; Determine students who are underrepresented, have a B+ or better GPA, have expressed interest in attending a military academy or direct enlistment into the U.S. Coast Guard<br />&bull; Send a same day email response and subsequent variable print, personalized postcard on behalf of the USCGA to determine the student's interest in being recruited by the Academy<br />&bull; Emails and postcards will each contain a personalized URL (PURL) to take students to a partially pre-populated form with data already provided to NRCCUA to increase potential response rate and accuracy of information. <br />&bull; NRCCUA will then deliver to the USCGA on a weekly basis the largest possible number of highly qualified URM students who have self-declared interest in the USCGA for further recruitment.<br />Authority FAR 6.302-1
<p>Any firm that believes they can meet these requirements may give written notification. Supporting evidence must be sufficient to demonstrate ability to comply. Please contact Ms. Patricia Soares with any technical questions or concerns.</p>

<SUBJECT>Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Opportunity for Exploration of 3-Dimensional Data Capture and Digitizing Systems for Field Use in Department of Defense Logistics Operations 
<SOLNBR>USTCTT0214
<RESPDATE>013114
<CONTACT>Mark Surina, Manager, ORTA, Email TCJ5-ORTA@ustranscom.mil - 
<DESC>United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), on behalf of its transportation component command, Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (MSDDC), is seeking non-federal partners ("Collaborators") from industry and academia for consideration to enter into Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) (described in 15 USC 3710a). USTRANSCOM/MSDDC is seeking CRADA Collaborators to explore and advance the military's ability to create feasible container loading plans which are more effective than the military's current capability in accommodating irregularly- or complex-shaped items, with the goal of more efficient use of container volume and corresponding decreased transportation costs. The capability of greatest interest is rapid and accurate capture/digitizing of all dimensions and profiles of the object to be shipped, regardless of the complexity of its shape. There is a time and accuracy challenge in capturing dimensions of irregularly-shaped items: those items with one dimension greatly differing from the other two, composed of non-linear shapes (e.g., compound curves), items whose shape does not allow them to be "nested", and/or items assembled from multiple subcomponents of asymmetric shape which are far from cubical or rectangular in profile.
<p>Examples of irregularly- or unusually-shaped items include: aircraft tow bars; tank turrets; air stairs; backhoes; anchors; vehicles with high ground clearance; antennas on masts; automobile engine lifts, cranes, etc.</p>
<p>Traditional loading processes would simply encase these items in a subcontainer with cubical or rectilinear dimensions. This approach simplifies container stuffing, but also imposes a significant amount of void space within the subcontainer or the shipping container itself.</p>
<p>Specific innovation interests include, but are not limited to:<br />- Improved methods of accurately and easily capturing/digitizing the dimensions of complex shapes/irregularly-shaped items' dimensions in the field at austere locations in the continental United States (CONUS) or beyond CONUS, as well as in well-equipped storage locations or transportation nodes worldwide;<br />- Features and utility of existing systems and techniques of capturing and digitizing currently used outside of the Department of Defense, potentially adaptable to DOD use, and the effort required in doing so;<br />Methods to capture dimensions which accommodate single items or multiple items (potentially hundreds per day) with significantly reduced data capture time and increased accuracy compared to current manual processes. <br />- Hardware, software and data interfaces;<br />- Human-system interfaces;<br />- Predicted reliability, durability, and affordability (including return on investment) of the techniques; <br />- Methods of formatting captured data for legacy decision support systems (for example, data feeding optimization capabilities like those in the Integrated Computerized Deployment System (ICODES)). <br />- Operator training requirements and ownership and maintenance concepts</p>
<p>CRADA Collaborators should have significant expertise and experience in automated data capture techniques in field use.</p>
<p>This collaborative effort may involve the following activities or others, as mutually agreed by the government and its industry or academia partners:<br />- Jointly exploring best practices and various approaches used in industry but not yet widely used in the Department of Defense;<br />- Joint development of employment concepts (CONEMPs) for techniques and systems new to the DOD;<br />- Exploration and development of new techniques in laboratory and/or realistic environments (including field trials) in either the Collaborator's or the government's representative operational environment.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for a procurement contract, nor should this announcement be construed as implying any future solicitation by USTRANSCOM, MSDDC, or any other Government agency in this area.<br />Small and large businesses, universities, and other non-federal parties may respond to this announcement. Respondents (potential Collaborators) may team. <br /><br />Multiple federal agencies may participate in this collaborative project on behalf of or in partnership with USTRANSCOM and MSDDC, including federal laboratories and other agencies as the U.S. Government deems appropriate.<br />Information, discussions, demonstrations, and other collaborative activities are proposed to remain at the UNCLASSIFIED level. If classified information exchange is indicated, Collaborator personnel must provide, at no cost to the Government, clearance documentation prior to classified data/information exchange.<br /><br />Results and products of this collaborative effort may include reports, presentations, simulations, demonstrations, and analyses of feasibility, technical maturity, costs, risks, etc., as well as (but not limited to) doctrine, training, CONEMP, and CONOPS information.<br />CRADAs are defined in 15 USC 3710a(d), in part, as "any agreement between one or more federal laboratories and one or more non-federal parties under which the Government, through its laboratories, may provide personnel, services, facilities, equipment, data, information, intellectual property and other resources with or without reimbursement (excluding funds to non-Federal parties) and the non-Federal parties may provide personnel, services, facilities, equipment, data, information, intellectual property, funds, and other resources toward the conduct of specified research or development efforts which are consistent with the missions of the laboratory; except that such term does not include a procurement contract..."</p>
<p>CRADAs resulting from this announcement are forecast to be in effect for approximately a 2-year period, although duration can be tailored to suit both parties' needs, by mutual agreement, before or after work begins.<br />USTRANSCOM and other Government agencies selected by USTRANSCOM will evaluate potential Collaborators' white papers (submittal instructions follow), based on Collaborator demonstrated applicable experience, technical qualifications, resources offered, etc. Government resources available for collaboration will also be considered as part of the government's selection process. USTRANSCOM will choose one, multiple, or zero white papers and so notify respondents that further discussions are desired.</p>
<p>Initial white paper selection and subsequent discussions do not guarantee selection of any Collaborator by USTRANSCOM to actually enter into a CRADA.<br />After initial Government white paper selection, discussions will ensue separately with each potential Collaborator, seeking to reach mutual agreement between USTRANSCOM and the Collaborator(s) on objectives, duration, intellectual property, and resources to be applied by the parties in the proposed CRADA(s). The Government may choose to visit applicable facilities to observe Collaborator capabilities prior to final selection. The Government may choose to hold an Industry Day or similar activity, at or near Scott AFB, Illinois either before or after initial white paper selection.<br />No Government funding is available to cover white paper preparation or submittal costs, or to cover discussions, facility visits, or any other Collaborator costs of preparation or participation in a CRADA.</p>
<p>The USTRANSCOM CRADA template is available at http://www.ustranscom.mil/about/org/tccs/Model_USTRANSCOM_CRADA.pdf for potential Collaborator familiarization. Collaborator(s) and USTRANSCOM will jointly draft and seek agreement on specific CRADA Joint Work Plan scope, objectives, resource commitments, deliverables and supporting language through discussions and mutual agreement after initial Collaborator selection.<br />Interested parties should submit white papers not later than 12:01 AM (midnight US Central time) on 31 Jan 2014 via e-mail only, to TCJ5-ORTA@ustranscom.mil in the following format. <br />- Microsoft Word or .pdf format of not more than 8 pages in length, on standard 8&frac12; by 11-inch page, with 1-inch margins at top, bottom, left and right, in Times New Roman font of not less than 12-point size, with not more than 6 lines per inch. <br />- Pages numbered sequentially in the bottom footer including submitting organization's name on each page. <br />- Clearly marked/identified Proprietary Information; photos, diagrams, etc.<br />- Include the following information (within the 8-page limit): <br />-- Title (no separate title page needed)<br />-- Company name and State of incorporation, plus incorporation of any parent entity. Companies with foreign ownership or parentage must identify the nation of incorporation of the non-U.S. entity; USTRANSCOM must inform the US Trade Representative of CRADAs with non-U.S. entities.<br />-- University name and location/state or nation of incorporation, plus state of incorporation of parent educational institution, if applicable.<br />-- Description and location of any specialized facilities or capabilities (other than typical office space) to be dedicated to the collaborative effort. An optional brief video overview of facilities or Collaborator capabilities (approx. 5 megabytes or less), in addition to the 8-page textual white paper, may be submitted.<br />-- Discussion of how potential Collaborator meets USTRANSCOM's stated interests and will contribute to a CRADA partnership in the subject area. Interest areas include: a description of the Collaborator's innovation capabilities, ability to understand and analyze user needs, develop advanced concepts, design systems compatible with existing Government systems, mitigate risks of development, production, integration, etc., model, simulate, produce reports, host meetings, exercises, or experiments, perform economic analyses, and otherwise apply resources and expertise to collaborative development of pertinent concepts and systems.<br />-- Resources to be supplied by the Collaborator (such as facilities, personnel, expertise, information systems, proprietary materials, prototypes, etc.).<br />-- Open source software and any third party software to be used or provided by the Collaborator. <br />-- Resources requested from USTRANSCOM (such as personnel, skill sets, data, information, facilities, access, etc.)<br />-- Collaborator background/experience in applicable/related system development, engineering, integration with existing systems and infrastructures, economic and other analysis, testing, operation, etc. Provide DOD points of contact with addresses/phone numbers as references, if available.<br />-- Collaborator(s) point(s) of contact (name, address, e-mail, and phone) for notification of selection/non-selection and follow-on actions (if chosen).<br />USTRANSCOM and other Government agency personnel participating in white paper review and follow-on collaborative work under CRADA may include in-house support contractors and members of Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC). Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) will be accomplished wherever needed to protect respondent intellectual property. The USTRANSCOM Office of Research and Technology Applications (ORTA), which orchestrates USTRANSCOM Technology Transfer activities, is operated by members of the MITRE Corporation's National Security Engineering Center (NSEC) FFRDC. White papers from respondents that do not become CRADA collaborators will be retained in USTRANSCOM ORTA records and all appropriately marked proprietary information will be protected.</p>

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be <br />contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the <br />Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and <br />Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p><strong>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</strong></p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><strong>MSC TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS:</strong></p>

<DESC>UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is seeking a commercialization partner for the Piranha/Raptor text mining technologies. The ORNL Technology Transfer Office will accept licensing applications through January 31, 2014.
<p>ORNL's Piranha, Raptor, and DTHSTR text mining technologies solve the challenge most users face: finding a way to sift through large amounts of data that provide accurate and relevant information. This requires software that can quickly filter, relate, and show documents and relationships. Piranha is JavaScript search, analysis, storage, and retrieval software for uncertain, vague, or complex information retrieval from multiple sources such as the Internet. With the Piranha suite, researchers have pioneered an agent approach to text analysis that uses a large number of agents distributed over very large computer clusters. Piranha is faster than conventional software and provides the capability to cluster massive amounts of textual information relatively quickly due to the scalability of the agent architecture.</p>
<p>While computers can analyze massive amounts of data, the sheer volume of data makes the most promising approaches impractical. Piranha works on hundreds of raw data formats, and can process data extremely fast, on typical computers. The technology enables advanced textual analysis to be accomplished with unprecedented accuracy on very large and dynamic data. For data already acquired, this design allows discovery of new opportunities or new areas of concern. Piranha has been vetted in the scientific community as well as in a number of real-world applications.</p>
<p>The Raptor technology enables Piranha to run on SharePoint and MS SQL servers and can also operate as a filter for Piranha to make processing more efficient for larger volumes of text. The Raptor technology uses a set of documents as seed documents to recommend documents of interest from a large, target set of documents. The computer code provides results that show the recommended documents with the highest similarity to the seed documents.</p>
<p>The DTHSTR technology provides a user with a personalized, humanly manageable list of documents from a significantly larger, unmanageable set of documents without the user performing keyword searches. DTHSTR reduces the amount of direct user input (typing, purchases, shopping carts, search terms) and maximizes the use of desired user context (text in documents, text on web pages). Innovatively combining the use of text categorization, extraction, and clustering allows DTHSTR to push relevant information (or tags) to users solely based on the documents shared or provided to the engine. Results are fast, efficient, and targeted to the specific interests of each user regardless of the application domain. DTHSTR can also operate as a filter for the Piranha technology, enabling analysis of even larger volumes of documents.</p>
<p>Technology descriptions, publications, etc. can be found at: <br /><a href="http://www.ornl.gov/connect-with-ornl/for-industry/partnerships/technology-licensing/licensing-opportunity-announcements/piranha">http://www.ornl.gov/connect-with-ornl/for-industry/partnerships/technology-licensing/licensing-opportunity-announcements/piranha</a> <br />and<br /><a href="http://www.ut-battelle.org/pftt/docs/201202870_201102668_50000040_PFTT_FFC.pdf">http://www.ut-battelle.org/pftt/docs/201202870_201102668_50000040_PFTT_FFC.pdf</a></p>
<p>License applications will be evaluated based on prospective partners' ability and commitment to successfully commercialize the technology, with a preference for United States based businesses and small businesses.</p>

<DESC>This notice is being modified to correct the name of the vendor.<br /><br /><br />This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source purchase order and is not a request for competitive proposals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), NCEZID hereby announces its intent to solicit and enter into a contract with Bruker Daltronics, Ins., 40 Manning Road, Billerica, MA 01821 for the procurement of a yearly maintenance agreement for mass spectrometric equipment (Ultraflex III and Maxis UHR-TOF) and software (Proteinscape) from Bruker Daltronics, Inc.
<p><br />The agreement will provide at least one preventative maintenance visit per year, coverage for all costs, including parts, labor and travel, for any needed repairs to keep the instrument operating at original manufaturer specifications. In addition, service call response times need to be at least within 24 hours if not better with onsite repair starting within two business days. All repairs are to be performed using original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts and technicians trained by the OEM and certified to be up to date with the current knowledge of the equipment.</p>
<p><br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). The manufacturer of the instruments (Bruker Daltronics, Inc) will not ensure that the instruments will perform at original specifications unless genuine manufacturer parts and manufacturer trained technicians provide service. Bruker Daltronics, Inc will provide field and software upgrades. Service by a third party will void any existing warranties and require additional costs for Bruker Daltronics, Inc to service the instrument directly. Bruker Daltronics, Inc responds to all service calls within 24 hours via on-line diagnostics or less from placement of the service call. Bruker Daltronics, Inc is the only vendor which has the parts and training to maintain the instrument and software.</p>
<p><br />The NAICS code for this acquisition is 811219 and the small business size standard is $19 million dollars. Award will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures found in FAR Part 13.</p>
<p><br />Interested parties who feel they possess the expertise, experience and ability should submit a capabilities statement to Tonya S. Justice, Contract Specialist, via email at TJustice@cdc.gov or to Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, MS E15, 2960 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341. Reference #2013-57733. Vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p><br />The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for these services and/or supplies in the future.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, the Government shall consider all responses received within two (2) days of this posting, in accordance with FAR 5.203 (A)(1). If no affirmative responses are received within two (2) days, negotiations will be conducted with the Bruker Daltronics, Inc. as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>
<p><br />A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notification, is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

(c) Alternatively, offerors may propose products and services that provide equivalent facilitation. Such offers will be considered to have met the provisions of the Access Board standards for the feature or components providing equivalent facilitation. If none of the offers that meet all applicable provisions of the standards could be accepted without imposing an undue burden on the agency or component, or if none of the offerors propose products or services that fully meet all of the applicable Access Board's provisions, those offerors whose products or services meet some of the applicable provisions will be considered eligible for award.

<p>1. Provide a minimum of one reference and include the contact name, phone, email, company name &amp; address and the period of performance and/or multiple dates.<br />2. Weekly censuses of the number of California sea lion males hauled out will be conducted by the Contractor at Naval Base Kitsap Bremerton in conjunction with and coordinated with similar sea lions censuses at Naval Station (NAVSTA) Everett by National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), staff and at Naval Base Kitsap Bangor by staff of Navy Facilities Engineering Command Northwest. To optimize the timing of those counts hourly counts will be conducted on one day each month at each location to assess diurnal patterns in number of animals hauled-out. The hour of maximum number hauled out will be used to conduct all censuses during the 2-week period. The Contractor must have a Marine Mammal Protection Act and Endangered Species Act Permit that allow them to conduct census activity of California and Steller Sea Lions including "takes" by harassment.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>&emsp;<br />SCOPE OF WORK <br />NFFS7300-14-00181 <br />TAGGING AND BEHAVIORAL MONITORING OF SEA LIONS <br />IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST IN PROXIMITY TO NAVY FACILITIES</p>
<p>QUOTING: THE BREAK DOWN IS GOOD TO SEE, BUT THE REQUIREMENT <br />WILL BE A LUMP SUM FIRM FIXED PRICE AWARD.</p>
<p>The National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Alaska Fisheries Science Center has entered into an Interagency Agreement with the US Navy, Pacific Fleet Environmental to conduct a study of Tagging and Behavioral Monitoring of Sea lions in the Pacific Northwest in Proximity to Navy Facilities. Projects in the 2 year study include: Assess number of California sea lions and percentage of time animals are hauling-out each month on structures and assets near Puget Sound naval facilities at Everett, Bremerton and Bangor, assess the location of marine foraging areas and assess the foraging behavior of adult male sea lions in inland waters of Washington.</p>
<p>To accomplish these projects NMML, a contracted group or agency (Contractor) and Navy Facilities engineering Command Northwest personnel will conduct weekly surveys of sea lions hauling out at each of the three facilities. The Contractor will construct and deploy floating sea lion hauling platforms/traps at Naval Station Everett and Naval Base Kitsap, Bremerton, and monitor them for sea lion use. The Contractor will capture 30 adult male sea lions and NMML will attach satellite tags to their pelage to track their hauling and foraging behavior.</p>
<p>Specific tasks to be carried out by the contractor are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Labor and Overhead is estimated at about 2000 hours.</p>
<p>&bull; The estimated cost for Travel is at $6,500. Your company may estimate a lower or higher sum in this fixed rate for the order. The travel estimate is based upon our estimate of travel needed to conduct surveys, animal captures, and instrument recovery over ~ 2 year period at prevailing GSA rates. The GSA rates were used for estimate purposes.</p>
<p>&bull; Weekly censuses of the number of California sea lion males hauled out will be conducted by the Contractor at Naval Base Kitsap Bremerton in conjunction with and coordinated with similar sea lions censuses at NAVSTA Everett by NMML staff and at Naval Base Kitsap Bangor by staff of Navy Facilities Engineering Command Northwest. To optimize the timing of those counts hourly counts will be conducted on one day each month at each location to assess diurnal patterns in number of animals hauled-out. The hour of maximum number hauled out will be used to conduct all censuses during the 2-week period. The Contractor must have a Marine Mammal Protection Act and Endangered Species Act Permit that allow them to conduct census activity of California and Steller Sea Lions including "takes" by harassment.</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor must have expertise and experience in designing and operating floating sea lion traps. The Contractor will provide to NMML specifications of a hauling platform and trap. The Contractor will install a 16 X 16 foot hauling platform and trap at NAVSTA Everett and Bremerton by anchoring it to the ocean bottom.</p>
<p>&bull; To estimate the proportion of time hauled out and locations of foraging areas the Contractor will provide 3 biologists who with assistance of NMML staff will capture 30 or more adult male California sea lions in Puget Sound on a floating trap and attach satellite tags to the pelage of restrained animal. The Contractor's personnel must have expertise and experience capturing and handling large and dangerous adult male California and Steller Sea lion in the wild. Demonstrated experience handling adult male California sea lions is required to assure personnel safety and animal care considerations.</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will assist NMML staff in retrieval of instrument packages from sea lions. Sea lions undergo annual migration between Washington and rookeries in California and in August undergo a molt during which the instrument packs will fall off. Aerial and boat surveys will be used to recovery instruments in coastal California, Oregon and Washington. The Contractor must have experience in tracking instruments with VHF radio tags from aircraft and vessels.</p>
<p><br />&bull; The Contractor will assist NMML staff with reporting and publication of findings. <br />3. Annual reports required by 15 May 2014 and 15 May 2015 within the NMFS/Navy Interagency Agreement. The Contractor's contributions will be due 1 May each year.<br />4. Comprehensive report due 30 September 2015 with the following elements:</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will provide a quarterly report of census data of adult male haul out at NAVSTA Kitsap Bremerton</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will assist with calculation of monthly correction factors for count data from NAVSTA Everett or other trapping location by species as appropriate</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will prepare a report on geographical distribution and foraging behavior of California sea lion adult males in inland waters of Washington (and Steller Sea Lions if tagged).</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will prepare a report on migration and foraging behavior of California sea lions in coastal Washington, Oregon and California (and Steller Sea Lions, if tagged).<br />&emsp;<br />ACQUISITION ALERT 13-07 DATED JULY 31, 2013 <br />SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY AND RESEARCH MISCONDUCT<br />(NAO 202-735D) - ATTACHMENT<br />SCIENTIFIC AND RESEARCH MISCONDUCT</p>

Under any maintenance agreement, Contractor agrees to maintain compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for all EIT. <br />In order to comply with 36 CFR 1194 Section 41, the Contractor shall submit all soft copies (e.g., user manuals, product documentation, etc.) in a format that will be readable using assistive technology, (e.g., screen reader).

This meeting will be held during the Contractor's 30-calendar day review period. If after the meeting, the Contractor disagrees with assessment, the Contractor may request that the Office of Acquisition Operations Branch Chief resolve the matter. <br />It shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor to inform the CO or COR of any changes to the Contractor's designated representative.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Operational Test Command, Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate (ABNSOTD) intends to award a sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii) to Trex Enterprises Corporation, 10455 Pacific Center Court, San Diego, CA 92121-4339,  to develop new capabilities in the existing Geometric Automated Video Location System (GAVELS), produce GAVELS hardware and software for the ABNSOTD, and to provide GAVELS sustainment support for all GAVELS systems at ABSNOTD and FIRES Test Directorate (FTD). To award to a contractor other than the incumbent would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government as well as cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the ABNSOTD's requirements. The current GAVELS was developed to score artillery rounds for the FTD. This contract will develop the additional capability for the existing GAVELS-NVC to track paratroopers. Upon completion of the development, the upgraded system consisting of eight Data Collection Systems, one Data Reduction System, a Remote Control System and all system software will be delivered to ABNSOTD. Period of performance for the IDIQ contract is 36 months from date of award. Total estimated cost for this effort to include sustainment and the upgrade, development and production of the GAVELS is approximately $4,502,441.00 for three (3) years. The minimum expenditure on the contract is estimated to be $869,727 and the maximum $4,502,441.00. The current GAVELS was awarded competitively to TREX under contract W9115U-11-C-0003 and the government requires enhanced systems capabilities to meet mission essential needs.  <br>  <br> FTD and ABNSOTD at times share GAVELS assets. For this reason, it is imperative that the FTD and ABNSOTD systems be 100% compatible.  The FTD GAVELS and the ABNSOTD GAVELS shall maintain a competitive software package that allows each GAVELS to be interchangeable. The Government currently owns GAVELS 1.0 software and the technical data package, which is the baseline for the GAVELS. The technical data package that the Government is in possession of consists of Binary (executable) software files required for operation of all GAVELS components and subsystems, the Server SDK consisting of Trex ImageServer SDK, consisting of all header and import library files for all Trex ImageServer and Trex Telescope Toolkit modules used in the GAVELS system, allowing the government to make future modifications and extensions to the GAVELS system, all 3rd-party software modules used by the GAVELS, including Software Development Kits (SDKs), etc.,  source codes for all GAVELs-specific modules developed under the GAVELS contract and all software licenses acquired using GAVELS contract funds. The Government is also licensed for unlimited use and distribution of all Trex-developed software components mentioned. Although the Government owns a technical data package, the Government does not own the source codes to Trex's pre-existing modules and libraries that are currently being used with GAVELS 1.0. The Government only has access to the header and binary form. Without these source codes a vendor will encounter difficulties successfully accomplishing the work required to upgrade and perform sustainment work on the existing GAVELS as well as design, test and develop new software and hardware to ensure uniformity of performance and operation within the two systems. The new contractor would have to branch off of the existing software which could cause difficulties maintaining interoperability of binaries generated by two separate branches of code. In order to work out the potential problems that branching may cause would require additional funding and time to the Government in which the Government does not have. The Government is in need of the new software no later than August 2013 and the new hardware no later than November 2013 to be able to meet the needs of upcoming tests.  <br>  <br> The NAICS code is 334220 with a size standard of 750. The proposed contract action is for end items for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability by responding to this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government will only consider the capability submissions received within fifteen days after date of publication of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be used only for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may identify interest and capability by responding to this synopsis. All respondents must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), and have a valid DUNS number, Cage Code, and Tax Identification Number. All responses must be written and sent via electronic mail to the Government point of contact for this announcement claudetta.n.smith.civ@mail.mil and theodore.h.panknin.civ@mail.mil. The Government will not accept telephone inquiries or responses. <br>

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal. (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction. <BR> <BR>(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so.

<DESC>This amendment revises the Pre-Solicitation Notice. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Changes to the pre-solicitation are underlined and&nbsp;<strong>underlined/bolded</strong>.</span> <br /><br /><strong>Description</strong>
<p>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression (LRBGE), plans to procure on a sole source basis the LSM 780 Confocal Microscope with 34 Channel Spectral Detection from Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY 10594.<br /><br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement. <br /><br />Delivery Date: 16 weeks from date of award.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTE: An RFQ notice will be posted in GSA e-Buy under RFQ839862 for items with GSA pricing. All parties interested must submit a quote with both Open Market and GSA pricing. An award will be made in the aggregate.</span></strong> <br /><br />The CCR Fluorescent Microscopy Core Facility was established by the NCI Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression (LRBGE) in 1998. The core facility provides state-of-the-art confocal microscopy, deconvolution microscopy and digital imaging to CCR investigators to perform high quality basic, translational and clinical research in cancer biology and to train students, residents, and fellows in state of the art methods in optical microscopy. The core facility also provides services and opportunities for collaborative research to investigators throughout the NCI as well as other NIH Institutes.<br /><br />Key application areas in the facility include procedures for single, double and triple label imaging of fixed and living specimens. Long-term Time-lapse imaging of live specimens is also a common application. In addition to these procedures, the facility personnel and users have special expertise in several advanced procedures. These include methods for the determination of molecular interactions within live cells. LRBGE is using two different approaches to measure these interactions: fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Finally, a number of facility users are studying the cellular response to DNA damage, and these researchers wish to use confocal microscopy to induce DNA damage at defined sites within the cell nucleus, and then study the cellular response to that damage.<br /><br />Contractor Requirements are:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parts required:</span></p>

<p>&#61607; Spline scan for excitation and data acquisition along a curved line, essential for measurements along biological samples (e.g. cell membranes, cell processes).</p>
<p>&#61607; Multitracking for the prevention of cross-talk by linewise or framewise switching of the laser excitation line, essential for multi-fluorescence applications and co-localization studies.</p>
<p>&#61607; Automatic brightness compensation during the acquisition of z stacks by stepped incrementation of the excitation (laser intensity) and/or the detection gain (detector sensitivity). Must support at least a 5 point incrementation.</p>
<p>&#61607; Advanced time-series module with automatic bleach and direct trigger- control to design the entire experimental protocol. All scan strategies can be applied (line, spline, frame, z-line, z-spline, z-stack, rROIs, z-rROIs) in the time series.</p>
<p>&#61607; Absolute linear scanner movement to ensure equal pixel dwell-times as a prerequisite for any quantitative studies.</p>
<p>&#61607; Calibration and linearization of the 32-Array GaAsp detector and the two flanking single PMTs, all 34-channels can be used for spectral acquisition and analysis.</p>
<p>&#61607; 34-Channel GaAsP detector (GaAsp-array with 32 PMTs and two flanking single PMTs) in combination with the highly efficient holographic grating to provide an even spectral dispersion over the entire visual spectral range.</p>
<p>&#61607; Spectral recycling loop efficiently recovers non-separated light, redirecting it onto the holographic grating.</p>
<p>&#61607; Fast parallel acquisition in one single scan of the entire spectral range as a lambda stack (391-749 nm) covered by the 34-Channel QUASAR Detector. (Suitable for spectral analysis in living cells, e.g. colocalization studies and FRET-experiments). Up to 10 different fluorescent dyes can be imaged and separated simultaneously.</p>
<p>&#61607; Spectral bandwidth for lambda stack acquisition must be selectable by the user. A full spectral image is used for unmixing (suitable for spectral imaging of living cells and later unmixing without any spectral distortions).</p>
<p>&#61607; Reproducible high resolution spectral data acquisition with 3.2 nm or 4.9 nm steps through sequential spectral scanning in addition to the 10nm parallel spectral scanning.</p>
<p>&#61607; Online Fingerprinting: Image channel definition not by emission bands but by reference spectra and live processing unmixing during image acquisition.</p>
<p>&#61607; Spectra can be created from a Lambda stack.</p>
<p>&#61607; Free combination of manually defined, automatically extracted and spectra stored in the database is possible to perform unmixing on a lambda stack.</p>
<p>&#61607; Potential to use the entire emission spectrum for dyes for detecting with much higher signal to noise ratios (in contrast to detection with bandpass techniques).</p>
<p>&#61607; Optics designed for high transmission and aberration free imaging for 350 - 1100 nm.</p>
<p>&#61607; Pigtailed visible Lasers easily upgradeable. Plug and play bayonette mounting for easy maintenance and reliable, reproducible operation. No mirror alignment required for lasers.</p>
<p>&#61607; Quantitative Colocalization is a part of the basic software with an interactive link between image display, scattergram and data table. The software includes interactive or automatic determination of thresholds, quantitative colocalization analysis with parameters like number of pixels, mean intensities +/-SD, colocalization coefficients, weighted colocalization coefficients, overlap coefficient after Manders, correlation coefficients, export of the analysis result and extraction of the colocalizing structures e.g. from image stacks.</p>
<p>&#61607; Transmitted detector must be included. Combination of a transmitted- light illuminator (e.g. a halogen lamp) with one of the detectors, fluorescent images can be superimposed with non-confocal transmitted light images.</p>
<p><strong>Software Options:</strong></p>
<p>&#61607; FRAP acquisition and analysis must be software integrated</p>
<p>&#61607; FCS -integrated Fluorescence Correlation software for single molecular analysis must be included</p>

<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>121813
<CONTACT>diane toledo-gaskins, Contracting Officer, Phone 2024024140, Email diane.e.toledo-gaskins@hud.gov
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source<br /><br />The Department of Housing and Urban Development, The Office of Housing Counseling (OHC) proposes to enter into a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition under statutory exceptions in accordance with FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii)under the Commercial Items Test Program for commercial items under section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 or the Services Acquisition Reform Act of 2003 (41 USC 428a {41 USC 1903 and 1904), with CredAbility, 270 Peachtree St, NW, Suite 1800, Atlanta, GA 30303 - 3066, <br />(404) 653-8810; Fax (404) 260-3303. <br /><br />The Office of Housing Counseling (OHC) is responsible for the administration and oversight of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Housing Counseling Program. Section 255 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-20) (NHA) authorized HUD to insure reverse mortgages, referred to as Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), which can be used by senior homeowners, age 62 and older, to convert the equity in their homes to monthly streams of income or a line of credit to be accessed as needed. HECMs must be repaid when the borrower no longer occupies the home. A HECM is originated by a lending institution, such as a mortgage lender, bank, credit union, or savings and loan association, and the mortgage is insured by HUD. HUD's regulations implementing the HECM program are codified at 24 CFR Part 206.
<p>To assist the senior homeowner in making an informed decision of whether a HECM meets their needs, the homeowner, consistent with section 255 of the NHA, is required to receive counseling by a HUD-approved HECM counselor. Section 255(f) of the NHA requires the provision of consumer education and information to HECM mortgagors by entities other than the lender. Each mortgagee must make available to a homeowner, at the time of the loan application, a written list of the names and addresses of third-party information sources that are approved by HUD as responsible to provide the statutorily required counseling. The counseling must include information on options other than a HECM, the financial implications of entering into a HECM, the tax consequences of a HECM, and any other information that HUD or the prospective borrower may request.<br /><br />CredAbility is unique among HUD-approved national housing counseling intermediaries in that it maintains an extensive research dataset on its HECM clients, and that dataset provides much more detailed information on the financial condition of HECM applicants over time than is available from any other readily available source. Participation of CredAbility in the study is of critical importance to Ohio State University researchers because of the extensive historical database on HECM clients that CredAbility maintains, and because CredAbility is an existing partner with OSU in both the MacArthur Foundation and HUD grants funding other parts of this research.</p>
This is a service contract to provide two services.<br />First, to provide web-based pre-purchase education program coupled with telephone pre-purchase one-on-one counseling with a certified housing counselor for the study participants in the Pre-Purchase Homeownership Counseling Demonstration and Impact Evaluation that will be randomly assigned to the remote, online plus telephone, pre-purchase counseling intervention. Second, pre-application counseling required as part of the HECM program for study participants in Aging in Place: Managing the Use of Reverse Mortgages to Enable Housing Stability, a study of HECM borrowers under HUD's Research Partnerships program.
<p>This notice of intent is for information purposes only, therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. All sources eligible to provide this service must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide the services outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response.&nbsp; If no responses are received with 5 days, 18 December, 2013 4:00 pm EST, after publication of this notice to the effect comparable services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. No questions will be addressed.&nbsp; Response to this award is to be sent to: Diane.e.toledo-Gaskins@hud.gov.</p>

<p>The Government requires office and related space yielding approximately 63,900 rentable square feet (RSF).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Minimum ABOA square feet: 53,500</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maximum ABOA square feet: 55,000</p>

<p><br />The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<p>Dusty Griffith<br />Contracting Officer, Public Buildings Service<br />819 Taylor Street, Room 5A18, Fort Worth, TX 76102<br />817.978.4335<br />dusty.griffith@gsa.gov</p>

Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).<br /><br />- Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building<br /><br />- List of building services provided</p>

<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center has awarded four contracts resulting from the subject solicitation. &lt;p&gt; NASA has a need to develop Shadow Mode Assessment using Realistic Technologies for the NAS (SMART NAS) capability to accelerate transformation of the NAS. Towards that end, NASA has a need for identifying detailed design architectures to enable SMART NAS. This capability will allow integrated, real-time and/or fast-time assessment of gate-to-gate operations and their performance using real-world NAS inputs. SMART NAS would allow for plug-and-play of different technologies to operate in combined real, virtual, and constructive manners as dictated by the study goals. Ultimately, the SMART NAS capability will be developed and implemented by NASAs Airspace Systems Program of the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate and will support the goal of accelerating the transformation of the NAS. The first step towards such development is to identify possible architectures, complete a benefits assessment and cost estimation. It is likely that development and implementation of the selected architecture will be done in-house, by civil servants with support from on-site contractors. &lt;p&gt; SCOPE OF WORK &lt;p&gt; Each of the selected contractors shall perform the following functional elements: Identify and develop open architecture alternatives for a SMART NAS capability. The simulation architecture itself will be open and the approach for the software functionality portions of the architecture will adhere to open source principles. Document and present proposed SMART NAS design architecture concept studies in sufficient detail to enable evaluation by NASA. Conduct a benefits assessment of the SMART NAS capability. Develop an initial cost estimate for capability development as well as maintenance. Identify logical steps to develop an operational SMART NAS capability.

<DESC>NASA has a need to develop Shadow Mode Assessment using Realistic Technologies for the NAS (SMART NAS) capability to accelerate transformation of the NAS. Towards that end, NASA has a need for identifying detailed design architectures to enable SMART NAS. This capability will allow integrated, real-time and/or fast-time assessment of gate-to-gate operations and their performance using real-world NAS inputs. SMART NAS would allow for plug-and-play of different technologies to operate in combined real, virtual, and constructive manners as dictated by the study goals. &lt;p&gt; Ultimately, the SMART NAS capability will be developed and implemented by NASAs Airspace Systems Program of the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate and will support the goal of accelerating the transformation of the NAS.

A 4-month extension was exercised on 28 August 2013 for the current contract vehicle W91187-12-D-0008. <br>  <br> This extension is being accomplished to allow time for the requiring activity and the contracting activity to do a thorough  job of conducting market research, using that insight to revise the PWS, and investigating the market place before competitively procuring a follow--on contract. The entire acquisition strategy is now being revised  to align more closely with what industry has stated is <br> being done in the commercial market. <br>  <br> The Government's  intent is to solicit a competitive follow-on requirement in early October 2013. This timeline will allow for the revision of documents and delays due to the end of the fiscal year. The timeline also allows for the solicitation to remain posted for 30 days and for thorough proposal evaluations  and if necessary  revisions. negotiations,  etc.

The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health<br />Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology.<br />Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.
<p>The work to be performed is aligned within the core scope of duties; however,the contractor is being directed to perform additional work. MACs shall enter<br />data into the HITECH Fiscal Intermediary Standard System (FISS) screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals. This data shall be obtained from the latest filed 12 month cost report. As later cost reports are accepted, MACs shall update the data in FISS within five business days of acceptance of the cost report (for those hospitals that have not yet arrested and received their initial payment). In addition, MACs shall review and determine an allowable amount for critical access hospital incentive payments, once submitted by the hospital. MACs shall complete its review and enter the allowable amount in FISS within 30 days of receipt of the documentation.</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to beestimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>
<p>This amount ($69,413) is a definization of the $125,000 previously put on contract.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this project is to significantly decrease the amount of water entering the dam through failed monolith waterstops.  <br>  <br> The project uses a variety of different methods to seal monolith joints including: pavement joint sealant methods, and surface mounted rubber gasket waterstops. Repairs will be performed in the dewatered fishway, on the roadway deck, and in several dam galleries. Portions of the repairs are time sensitive and need to be performed in the in-water work period between January 20, 2014 and February 28, 2014.  <br>  <br> This project covers all work required to furnish and install all of the different waterstop details shown in the contract drawings. This includes, but is not limited to: stainless steel plate and anchors, galvanized steel plate and anchors, rubber seals, foam backer rod, chemical grout, and urethane grout log waterstops. The work also includes drilling a vertical socket through the entire dam and periodically monitoring the drilling to insure the socket straddles the joint.  <br>
