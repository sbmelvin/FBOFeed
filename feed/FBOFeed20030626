<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with NetRatings, Inc. for a second year of service for professional services for the Web Evaluation Project. The contractor will perform an internet audience measurement service which supports NLM’s mission.  The contractor will provide NLM with access codes and any necessary reporting and access software, for online access to NetRatings reports and deliverables.  NetRatings is uniquely qualified to provide an internet audience measurement service that includes drill down data on NIH.gov web sites.  NLM staff reviewed the marketplace for providers of such Internet measurement services.  NLM staff conducted searches of the web and consumer health information sites, and made inquiries of persons and organizations familiar with this market.  NLM staff determined that NetRatings was the only vendor able to provide complete NIH.gov drill down data as an integral part of its basic Internet audience measurement service, compared to other Internet audience measurement vendors.  Also, NetRatings uses a proprietary methodology and software that are not available from other vendors.  Additionally, NLM requires that the drill-down measurement data be compatible and consistent from year to year, and no other vendor could exactly replicate the NetRatings data formats.  Finally, NetRatings has an established track record with NLM over the past year and offers continuity of service (with consistent drill down methodology, data analysis, and presentation).  This service will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  Responses should demonstrate the firm's ability to meet the Government's requirements. Responses are required within 7 (seven) calendar days from the publication date of this notice. NLM synopsis No. 03-161 shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement. Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Michael G. Kapsilis, Contract Specialist (301) 496 6546 kapsilm@mail.nlm.nih.gov or Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, (301) 496 6545.

 Draft Statement of Work

Scope: (short summary of what the order for commercial items covers) A laboratory expert on gonorrhea testing is needed to help select a laboratory in Bishkek for gonorrhea susceptibility testing, determine need for equipment and reagents, train the laboratory staff, monitor results of training, develop plan for susceptibility testing and establish and implement external proficiency control panels. 

Background: (Summary of what has lead up to this requirement) The US Government plans to assist the Government of Kyrgyzstan to establish treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STI) at the primary health care level using the World Health Organization Syndromic Management of Sexually Transmitted Infections approach. A study conducted in 1999 in Bishkek by the French-based organization Medecins Sans Frontiers found that 25% or more gonorrhea isolates from the Bishkek area were resistant to all antibiotics but ceftriaxone, cefixime and spectinomycin, all relatively expensive. In order to adequately treat gonorrhea using a syndromic approach, it is critical to identify the most appropriate antibiotics to use. In addition, should the resistance patterns have changed in the last few years enabling less costly drugs to be used to treat gonorrhea, more patients would have access to treatment. Finally, it has been established that people with untreated STIs are more susceptible to HIV infection, so it is very important that STIs be properly treated and cured.

Site Selection:  Neither the Government of Kyrgyzstan nor most of its people, at present, have the funds for both gonorrhea testing and treatment. Therefore, the syndromic approach to treatment is most practical under current economic conditions. Proper adjustment of the urethral discharge component of the syndromic guideline will require periodic surveillance and testing for antibiotic resistance. Such periodic surveillance should be the function of the Sanitary and Epidemiologic Service (SES), rather than a laboratory in the curative sector. Hence, the US Government would prefer that location of this gonorrhea susceptibility testing would be in the SES, if possible.

Objectives: (The results this purchase order will achieve) Establish gonorrhea susceptibility patterns in Kyrgyzstan which will form the basis for revising the urethral discharge component of the Syndromic Management of Sexually Transmitted Diseases guideline to be used nationally.

Contractor Tasks: (List contractor tasks) 
The contractor shall make at least three visits to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan to perform the tasks listed below:

1. Assess laboratories in Bishkek (at least three) and advise USAID on selection of laboratory best suited to provide gonorrhea susceptibility testing in Kyrgyzstan.

<DESC>Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC), under Prime Contract No. DE-AC08-01RW12101 with the United States Department of Energy (DOE) on the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP) in support of the Office of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM), is seeking information from potential sources that can design web-based interfaces for use by regulatory and technical specialists in their commitment preparation, tracking and status processes.

The YMP is a monitored geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste that will be licensed by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  In the course of licensing the facility, YMP will prepare correspondences, technical documentation, and status reports to fulfill the NRC licensing requirements. 

Specifically, this Request for Information (RFI) seeks the following information:
 
- commercially available web-based interfaces specifically catering to the engineering, geology and document production and retrieval activities, compatible with Oracle and Documentum solutions, modular and scalable for easy adaptation to changing missions, 
- commercially available web-based status tracking and schedule tracking applications that can be integrated into the workflow process.

Background

The Yucca Mountain Project is currently in the process of preparing a license application for authorization to construct a nuclear repository.  This process will include the preparation, tracking, retrieval, and processing of hundreds of documents between the DOE and NRC.  In addition, other aspects of interactions, such as meeting planning, technical exchanges, action tracking, and communication logs, will be tracked.  In an attempt to maximize the efficiency and quality of these work processes, automation plans are currently being evaluated.  One component of these automation plans would be a web-based, thin client interface between the end-users and databases.  The proposed interface would be tailored to the specific roles of each individual.  This RFI, therefore, is intended to survey the availability of commercially available solutions.
 
Submittal Information:

The decision to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the work described in this notice is solely within BSC's discretion.  Please note that this is not an RFP, and the information provided in response to this notice may be used as a basis for a future solicitation.

<DESC>The Program Manager (PM) for Test & Evaluation/Science & Technology (T&E/S&T), Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E)/Systems and Test Resources (S&TR) Office has a requirement  for the research and development of advanced architecture, sensing, network, and data management technologies that can enhance the state-of-the-art of embedded instrumentation in support of test and evaluation. A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will be published on or before 15 July 2003 in FEDBIZOPPS.  The PM, T&E/S&T, within DOT&E is charged with enhancing future T&E capabilities across the Department of Defense (DoD). The PM, T&E/S&T is leading an effort to establish an enhanced embedded instrumentation capability to support the test and evaluation of weapon systems, munitions, human systems, and command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems.  Weapon systems include air, land, sea, and space vehicles and weapon platforms and their accompanying support platforms.  Embedded instrumentation systems should have minimum impact on the tested system’s performance, volume, weight, power usage, overall design, manufacturing capability, etc. These embedded instrumentation systems should be available throughout the life of the tested systems, for follow-on tests, as well as supporting training and health monitoring. They should gather information on the tested system and weapon effects on targets (e.g., survive to gather data on the amount of directed energy applied to a target). Government organizations, commercial entities, universities, and other non-profit organizations capable of conducting appropriate research and development, in whole or in part, are invited to participate. This will be an unrestricted solicitation.

<DESC>The U.S. Marine Corps is leading a program to develop and acquire a Mobility Denial System (MDS) for Marine Corps and Army units.  This program is designed to assist the military and possibly law enforcement elements, in controlling mobs during unruly protests and violent confrontations.  The purpose of the system is to make surfaces so slippery that belligerents will be reluctant to enter the treated area or find it extremely difficult to function within that area.  By dispensing an extremely slippery anti-traction material by means of either a man-portable or a vehicle-transportable spraying system, the MDS will enable the military to create and maintain a greater stand-off distances between unruly crowds and friendly forces.

There are two dispensing systems being considered:  1) a “vehicle-transportable” system that can be transported in the back of a military vehicle such as the High-Mobility, Multi-purpose, Wheeled Vehicle, and 2) a “man-portable” system carried and employed by a single individual.  The services are contemplating the procurement of at least 800 items of such equipment (approximately 100 vehicle-transportable and approximately 700 man-portable systems).  A formal Request for Proposals for competitive bidding will be released sometime in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2004.

In anticipation of that solicitation, the Marine Corps will host an Industry Day at Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, on 24 July 2003.  The purpose of the Industry Day is to solicit interest and input on the system’s performance parameters and program strategy from industry.  Additional information on the Industry Day and the Military’s specifications and parameters for these systems can be found under “industry day” on the MDS website at www.mds.swri.org.  A registration form is included within this website.  It is requested that you download this form, complete the information and return to either Major McDaniel or to Alice Pladson via email, not later than 18 July 2003.  A demonstration of the anti-traction material will be included in the Industry Day agenda.

Parties interested in attending Industry Day are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement to Major Brock McDaniel at mcdanieldb@mcsc.usmc.mil or Ms. Alice Pladson at pladsonac@mcsc.usmc.mil.    Questions may be directed to either Major McDaniel at 703-432-3628 or Ms Pladson at 703-432-3736.  No hard copies via regular mail are requested at this time.  

This announcement is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire follow-on acquisition.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement, or otherwise pay for information requested.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this announcement and the Government use of such information.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort.  If so included, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Award will be based on full and open competition using the procedures in FAR Part 15.  The NAICS code for the proposed award is 926110.  Subcontracting with small business concerns and socially and economically disadvantaged entities: USAID encourages the participation, to the maximum extent possible, of U.S. entities that are small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, and disadvantaged enterprises.

<DESC>Amendment No. 1

The subject synopsis was inaccurately posted as a Combined Solicitation/Synopsis.  The Document Type is changed to a Presolicitation Notice.  This is not a commercial item.

The title of the synopsis is changed to correct the spelling of the word focus and shall read as follows: Complete and Disseminate a Toolkit to Prevent Obsity and Overweight in Adolescents with a Focus on Girls Through a Family Oriented Approach.

The Program Support Center (PSC) has a requirement for the Office on Women’s Health (OWH) to complete and disseminate a ToolKit to prevent overweight and obesity in adolescents with a focus on girls through a family oriented approach. This ToolKit builds on the success of the existing eating disorder initiative, BodyWise which distributed information packets to health care providers and school personnel. BodyWise has been evaluated and has been demonstrated to cause a significant positive change in the level of concern, attitudes and practices of school nurses in the identification and treatment of eating disorders. Preliminary work on this ToolKit includes bringing together experts to form an Obesity Steering Committee, reviewing literature and existing programs, conducting and analyzing focus groups with girls, parents and school nurses and developing and testing a draft ToolKit with pilot groups. The PSC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mary Lou Rife, Ph.D. of 2948 North Hampton Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20015 for her services.
The purpose of this 12 month contract is to adapt the ToolKit in accordance with the results from pilot testing, develop a prototype for demonstration purposes, develop a train the trainer manual for use with the ToolKit, develop a distribution strategy, develop print ready materials of the ToolKit, prepare and submit the ToolKit for Government review and approval, conduct training seminars, disseminate ToolKits and track dissemination of ToolKits.
This requirement has been justified in accordance with 
FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This project requires an in depth understanding of the elements of the Eating Disorder Campaign for the OWH which includes the development and facilitation of the Overweight and Obesity Steering Committee, production of a literature review on overweight and obesity in adolescents, conducting the OWH overweight and obesity focus groups, the development of BodyWise and the development of a draft ToolKit. Dr. Rife is uniquely qualified to accomplish this requirement due to her past experience in developing the Eating Disorder Initiative Campaign for the OWH which included the development and facilitation of the Overweight and Obesity focus groups and the development and pre-testing of the draft ToolKit.
Parties interesting in responding to this requirement shall provide a capability statement documenting their experience with similar projects focusing on overweight and obesity in adolescents. 
No solicitation document is available. Reference Number Note 22.

Remove the following language:  It is the governments preference to award two contracts.  However, if there does not appear to be a significant amount of work available to be done under the contract at the time of award, only one contract may be awarded. If two contracts are awarded, one will have a unique statement of work supporting the North Oil Company and the other will have a unique statement of work supporting the South Oil Company. Replace with:  The preferable contracting strategy for this project is the use of two ID/IQ contracts, one having a unique statement of work supporting the North Oil Company and the other having a unique statement of work supporting the South Oil Company.  The government's preference is that two contracts will be awarded to different contractors; one for the North and one for the South. Correct the estimated issue date from: 8 JULY 2003 to 7 JULY 2003.  Correct the proposals due date from:  14 AUGUST 2003 to 7 AUGUST 2003.

However, this acquisition will be processed in accordance with AFMC FAR Sup 5252.217-9018 (Mission Essential Quantity):  If a proven source is not the low offeror, the basic quantity may be split into a First Article quantity, for award to the low unproven offeror, and a Minimum Essential Quantity, for award to the proven source, with the balance of the requirement established as options in both contracts.  Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), ?Supplies (or services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements? may apply.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Environmental Services, Solicitation No. RFP5-01316-GDK, which was posted on April 4, 2003.	You are notified of the following:  The List of Interested Companies is revised to incorporate the following:  Hugh Archer/Mavickar Environmental Consultants, Inc. @ 717-540-9925; Lascelles Samuels/Topflite Building Services, Inc. @ 202-726-2500; Jennie Agerton/Environmental International Corporation @ 770-772-7100; Francesca Cartwright/EnviroTrac Ltd. @ 410-729-7979. The following questions are answered: 56.	QUESTION:  Will individual experience be treated with the same weight as corporate experience in the evaluation process?  Is it necessary for the personnel with the experience to currently be on the offeror's payroll or is a letter of commitment adequate?  If a letter of commitment is adequate will it be scored as higher risk than if the person is currently on the offeror's payroll? RESPONSE:  Yes, individual experience will be treated with the same weight as corporate experience in the evaluation process.  Solicitation clause L.13.3 - Mission Suitability Instruction by Subfactor, Subfactor A (NOTE) specifies the relevant experience be a current staff member.  This amends that factor to allow for a letter of commitment.  A letter of commitment is acceptable and will not be scored as a higher risk than if the person is currently on the offeror's payroll. 57.  QUESTION:  Pr SOW Section 1.4.1.l, Government Furnished Equipment:  The contractor is required to "[m]aintain all government furnished equipment to assure availability …"  Does the government pay for costs associated with preventive maintenance and calibration of government furnished equipment? RESPONSE:  These costs should be covered under Other Direct Costs (ODCs) in the offeror's proposal.  Actual costs will be paid when incurred and invoiced. 58.  QUESTION:  What do you mean by a "teaming contractor" (page 64, paragraph 4)?  Do you mean a named contractor or named subcontractor?  What is the difference in the terminology between a teaming contractor and a subcontractor? RESPONSE:  Under both terms, the government requires one prime contractor.  The difference in the terms is the offeror's approach to contracting. 59.  QUESTION:  Per SOW 1.4.1 Environmental Program Management e. Plans, Applications, Procedures, Reports and Notifications, what is the status of the existing Plans and what is the timeline for development/update? RESPONSE:  This information on existing plans is included in the Proposal Library.  All plans are expected to be drafted, reviewed, updated as necessary within the first year of the contract and as required by regulation, NASA Policy or SOW thereafter, throughout the period of performance. 60.  QUESTION:  If I understood correctly, there were a number of different contractors with a piece of the environmental program at Goddard and that has now been placed under one environmental umbrella.  Is that understanding correct?  What companies besides Occu-Health, and ECG currently have environmental contracts with/at Goddard? RESPONSE:  These services are not being performed at this time.  Previous contractors have varied for this requirement. 61.  QUESTION:  page 31 H.10 Export Licenses.  Will there be requirements to export? RESPONSE:  There is the potential to have contractor perform work at foreign sites under the IDIQ section, therefore the potential for exports. 62.  QUESTION:  What determines whether the contractor can submit interim cost vouchers?  For a small disadvantaged company such as ours interim payments are very important.  RESPONSE:  GSFC is implementing a new financial system and at this time cannot support interim vouchers more frequently than a monthly basis. 63.  QUESTION:	Section 1.4.3 Items d. and j. refer to "other 90- and 180-day staging facilities;" "actively-used TSDFs;" and "proposed TSDFs." Are TSDFs included in the scope of work?  If so, is any information available concerning how many of these facilities are (or are anticipated to be) located on GSFC and what types and the types and quantities of wastes that are (are anticipated to be) managed at such facilities?  Are any of these existing and proposed 90- and 180-day storage facilities at GSFC RCRA Part B-permitted hazardous waste storage facilities? RESPONSE:  GSFC does not have or plan to obtain a RCRA Part B permit for any GSFC facilities.  Attachment 1, Paragraph 1.4.3.d, TSDF reviews and audits refers to TSDF's that are used by GSFC (through the contractor) to treat, store or dispose of GSFC waste.  SOW Section 1.4.3(j) Hazardous Waste Management Inspections, refers to those sites at GSFC where hazardous waste is managed in SAA's 90-day facilities or 180-day facilities.	 64.  QUESTION:  Are you expecting metrics for the Representative tasks too? Please clarify.  RESPONSE:  Yes, in accordance with solicitation L.13.3, Subfactor A. 65.  QUESTION:   Do contract workers have to be US citizens? RESPONSE:  Yes, during the phase in period it is a requirement for US citizens due to security procedures and the short period of performance.  There will be required paperwork for badging to access the center during this period, which will take place at the time of award of the phase in.  For the contract, contractors are not required to be US citizens.  During phase-in for the contract, the contractor will be required to complete Locator and Information Services Tracking System (LISTS) forms, Name Check Request forms, fingerprint cards, and forms for foreign nationals for all personnel under the contract.	Requests for foreign nationals are processed under the following guidelines:  foreign nationals from non-designated countries must be submitted at least 10 days in advance; visits by foreign nationals from designated countries must be submitted at least 30 days in advance.     66.  QUESTION:  Regarding the Health and Safety Plan submission of this RFP.  We have looked at the Sample Plan, Appendix H. of the Safety Manual, which states:  1.2 Goals and Objectives. Describe specific goals and objectives to be met. Discuss status of safety program using the Performance Evaluation Profile (PEP) as safety performance criteria. Describe the contractor's approach (including milestone schedule) to achieve and maintain level 5 of the PEP in all areas (see contents of PEP). I have tried to access the PEP survey through internet links, with no luck. Is it possible to obtain a hard copy of this or can you provide a viable link? We need this to develop our specific Health and Safety Plan for submission. RESPONSE:  Please see the attached file "PEP survey contents". 67.  The Groundwater Investigation and Modeling Study of the Aquifer System, NASA Goddard Space Flight System, KCI, 2003 referenced in Attachment 1.5 - Groundwater Sampling, Laboratory Analysis, and Modeling does not appear in Section L.7 Proposal Library.  We need to see this or at least contact the preparer to research the following: QUESTION:  What graphical interface package (eg. Groundwater Vistas is a popular one) was sued with MODFLOW in the previous report.  We need to know the specific application.  What pre- and post-processing software was used?  What software was used for the fate and transport modeling?  The PCE-DCE daughter product scenario seems to indicate that multiple species modeling (more than likely Surfact) was done as opposed to single species modeling.   RESPONSE:  Visual MODFLOW was used to assemble the groundwater flow and transport modeling and view simulation results.  MT3D was used to simulate TCE transport.	PEST was used for hydraulic conductivity variable calibration.  Goddard Space Flight Center only has a license to use Visual MODFLOW version 2.8.2, which includes MODFLOW and MT3D. 68.  QUESTION:	 How many people do you anticipate are needed for this contract? RESPONSE:  Reference solicitation clause L.13.3, Subfactor B - Professional Qualifications.   69.  QUESTION:  How much office space will be provided at the GSFC site (overall square footage)?  Will the space be in one location, or will space be allocated in multiple buildings across the center? RESPONSE:  Office space will be provided for each contractor Full Time Equivalent (FTE) directly supporting the four (4) core requirements (minimum of 150 sq. ft. for 1 FTE and 75 sq. ft. for each additional FTE.  Space for two (2) employees is available in Building 27A, (90-day Hazardous Waste Staging Facility.  All other space will be provided as available.  Location of space will be dependent on the number of persons required to be accommodated. 70.  QUESTION:   Are all employees for this contract required to work on site? RESPONSE:  Not all employees supporting this contract are required to work on site. 71.  QUESTION:   With regards to laboratory analysis costs, it is our understanding that such costs would be bid out once the contract has been awarded.  This approach would be more competitive and should save GSFC money in the long run.  Please clarify if this is what GSFC wants. RESPONSE:  Laboratory costs are a requirement under this solicitation. 72.  QUESTION:   Spill response and chem. Reuse are both ID/IQ services, not included in our core rates.  However, it appears we are planning on using our on-site people to respond to the spills in an on-call status and to run the chem Re-use center.  Consequently, how will these be billed?   For instance, the sample task that has a spill during business hours, our response has to be within 10 minutes, so we have to use people on-site.  Also, it appears that it would make sense to use our on-site people to run the Chem. Reuse center since they will b familiar with the GSFC operations. RESPONSE:   The technical and costs proposals should be clear as to how the offeror intends to provide the services described and how much those services will cost. 73.  QUESTION:   In submitting the Cost Proposal, some subcontractors will appear with labor categories appearing in the IDIQ listing alone.  Is it correct to assume that cost proposals are not required from subcontractors supporting the IDIQ listing alone? RESPONSE:  There should be separate rates for the prime and the subcontractors labor categories. 74.  QUESTION:  Will there be more than one work shift?  If so, which areas will require this (i.e. Air Quality Program or Hazardous Waste Collection and Management, etc.)? RESPONSE:	Attachment 1 - SOW, Section 1.2.1 - General Requirements, sets the only specific work shift requirements.  The majority of activities at GSFC occur during normal daytime work hours.  The contractor will be expected to accomplish the work required in a manner that best supports GSFC missions. 75.  QUESTION:   Can a copy of the Service Contract Act Wage Determination for the Greenbelt, Maryland area be provided?  RESPONSE:  This solicitation does not have a Service Contract Act Wage Determination requirement.  You can contact the Department of Labor if you would like to obtain a wage determination for this area. 76.  Some clarification on the page limitations.  The following is what we understand: Technical Proposal - Understanding of Requirements, Subfactor A = 47 Pages Technical Proposal - Professional Qualifications, Subfactor B = ½ Page Per Position Technical Proposal - Management, Subfactor C = 20 Pages Technical Proposal - Safety and Health Plan, Subfactor D = 15 pages Business Management Proposal = Unlimited Pages The Mission Suitability Proposal must be divided and presented by each Mission Suitability subfactor as follows: Subfactor A-Understanding of Requirements Subfactor B-Professional Qualifications Subfactor C-Management Plan Subfactor D-Safety and Health Plan Each of the 4 Representative Tasks PLUS the Core Requirements are included in Subfactor A QUESTION:  Does this mean we have 47 total pages to address the 4 Core Requirements, the ID/IQ Requirements, and the ID/IQ Representative Tasks?  Clarification is requested. RESPONSE:  Subfactor A states that the four (4) CORE Requirements and four (4) ID/IQ representative tasks must be addressed.  The 47 pages allowed for Subfactor A should address these requirements as stated in the solicitation L.13.3. 77.  QUESTION:	L.10 - Determination of Compensation Reasonableness - Should this appear in the Business Management Proposal? RESPONSE:  Yes. 78.  QUESTION:  Can you please tell me how NASA considers an approved Mentor-Protégé relationship in their scoring criteria? RESPONSE:  An approved Mentor-Protégé relationship will not be a factor for adjusting scoring. 79.  QUESTION:  Page 64 of the solicitation states:  "The offeror shall provide a detailed phase-in plan that addresses, at a minimum, the offeror's approach to phase-in sufficient to ensure continuity and a smooth transition with the incumbent Contractor during the 14-day phase-in period."  Does this mean the company is required to begin the contract within 14 days of award? RESPONSE:  The selected offeror will be issued a fixed price order to complete a 14-day phase-in period that will take place prior to award of the actual solicitation.  The actual solicitation is anticipated to be awarded and effective immediately following the phase-in period. 80.  QUESTION:	RFPP Section L.12 states that "The government is looking for innovative approaches for meeting the statement of work requirements."	It is to the Government's advantage if such innovations result in a reduction in cost.	However, proposing cost saving innovations will put the offeror at a competitive disadvantage in the Adjustment for Cost Realism (RFP Section M.5.3) because a proposed price more than 5 percent below the Probable Cost will result in a reduced score.  Please resolve this apparent contradiction. RESPONSE:	Offeror's proposing innovative approaches should be clear in stating the innovation and the cost savings associated with the innovation.  The due date for responses is not extended.  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

User-friendly temperature control that is easy to operate, either through simple and objective procedures or a uniform interface, shall be judged more highly. Additionally, Cryogen maintenance requirements refer to both the periodic need to refill liquid cryogens (nitrogen and helium) and the periodic need to recycle closed-loop cryogenic helium-3.  Systems that operate for longer periods between cryogen maintenance shall be judged more highly. 2) Past performance and 3) Price.  Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. The selection factors for this RFQ are adherence to the technical specifications, user-friendly temperature control, cryogen maintenance requirements, past performance and price.*** 

Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Offerors shall include the make and model of the product, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which clearly documents that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications stated above.  Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/or information provided by NIST and its affiliates.  Offerors shall provide a list of at least THREE (3) REFERENCES to whom the same or similar products have been sold.  The list of references shall include, at a minimum: The name of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract and the address and the telephone number of the Contracting Officer if applicable; and the date of delivery or the date services were completed. Past Performance shall be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service provided by the Contractor.  Offerors with no relevant past performance shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably. ***

<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service(FWS), Mid-Columbia River FRO, desires to purchase Fish Tagging Accessories that go with the Northwest Marine Technology Binary Coded Wire Tags. The FWS is needing three (3) rectangular tunnel detectors (R9500) that detect a coded wire tag in a fish sliding throught the unit under the influence of gravity.  A tagged fish is indicated visually by a bright light emitting diode and audibly by a beeper. These tunnel detectors are 17 1/8 inches wide, 13 inches high and 48 1/2 inches long.  The inside dimensions are 4 5/8 by 9 1/2.  Along with the detector the FWS is needing three (3) diverter gates with counters for use when sampling large fish.  The FWS is also obtaining a hand held wire detecotr that goes with Northwest Marine Technologies Binary Coded Wire Fish Tags.  Thes wand type tag detecotra (patent #5,134,370) is a handheld unit which may be moved in the earth's magnetic field unlike other detectors which must remain stationary.

<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Department of Health and Human Services, contemplates awarding a contract modification of approximately eight (8) months duration on a sole source basis to John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY, prime contractor for CSAP’s National Center for the Advancement of Prevention (NCAP).  The statutory authority for this sole source contract modification is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)Only one responsible source, per FAR 6-302.1.  It is anticipated that this contract modification will be awarded without competition since its purpose is to expand the capacity of CSAP’s NCAP contract to accommodate FY2003 funding increments prior to the end of the Federal fiscal year.  FY 2003 funding increments from SAMHSA’s Center for Mental Health Services and Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, and the National Cancer Institute, will specifically support the review and identification of additional effective programs through SAMHSA’s National Registry of Effective Programs (NREP). Through consensus of experts, NREP rates programs on approximately 15 standard criteria related to the quality of evidence for program effectiveness. Within the timeframe of this project, the contractor will be required to:   
a) recruit, train and retain approximately 60 accomplished professionals to perform program reviews;
b) manage logistics for bringing reviewers to training sessions as appropriate;
c) coordinate materials review;
d) extend the review data system to incorporate all reviews accomplished through
the NREP process;
e) provide weekly reports on progress;
f)  build working relationships and coordinate with other contractors and CAPTs working on the dissemination of model programs;
g) enforce established consensus and quality control procedures.   
In turn, program reviewers must:
a) be approved by the Government Project Officer, and when performing work outside of SAMHSA designated topic areas, must also be approved by the sponsor of the work (e.g. NCI);
 b) represent expertise in research methods as well as specific substance or topic areas;
 c) be trained to ensure continued inter-rater reliabilities exceeding.90 on each of the review criteria before undertaking program reviews;
 d) commit time and effort to ensure completion of tasks within the timeframe.

The short time available between now and the end of the Federal fiscal year precludes the conduct of these activities by any contractual mechanism other than the current NCAP contract, now at its dollar limit or full capacity.  The NCAP contract, now in its fifth and final contract year, is due to expire in February 2004.   This proposed modification provides a limited FY 2003 funding “bridge” between the current NCAP contract and a new contract for NREP activities to be awarded in FY2004.

This in no way obligates the Government to award the modification.  Responses to this notice shall be mailed to Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Office of Program Services, Contracts Management Branch, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockwall II Building, Suite 640, Rockville, MD 20852 Attn:  Matt Johnson.  Telephone and/or e-mail responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received by in writing no later than July 11, 2003 by 3:00PM Eastern Standard Time.****

<ARCHDATE>09092003
<CONTACT>Rita Dingler, 256-235-6027
<DESC>NA Anniston Army Depot is seeking companies who have the capability to upgrade a high-pressure water jet coating removal system.  The High Pressure Water Jet Coating Removal System was designed, manufactured and installed by TAFA Incorporated in 1995.  The sy stem drawings for the High Pressure Water Jet Coating Removal System and the control software that operates the system are proprietary to TAFA Incorporated, now part of Praxair Surface Technologies.  Praxair Surface Technologies acquired TAFA Incorporated in 1999.  The purpose for upgrading the High Pressure Water Jet Coating Removal System is to replace aging or worn out components of the system with new components to produce an improved system.  As a minimum, the major components of the system to be repla ced are the system control unit, all motion servers, robotic arm, nozzle/stripping head assembly, servo-driven turntable, and all high-pressure plumbing.  The contractor will be responsible for removing the existing components to be replaced and installing  the new components in the system.  The new components must be integrated into the system with the remaining original components to produce an improved, complete and functional system capable of performing all required part stripping processes.  The existi ng system contains stripping process programs for approximately 20 different parts.  Many of these parts have more than one program, resulting in a total of more than 40 programs.  As part of the upgrade the contractor will be responsible for transferring,  or recreating, all existing part stripping process programs to the upgraded system to make the upgraded system capable of performing all part stripping processes that are currently performed on the existing system.   Interested companies are requested to provide brochures, literature, published prices lists, POC for similar type modifications, and outline of modifications required, not later than 15 days after synopsis appears in the CBD.   Information must be submitted electronically.  Information may be faxed to 256-235-4618 or sent to Rita Dingler at dinglerr@anad.army.mil.  This is a sources sought synopsis - do not request a solicitation.

<SUBJECT>D -- Next Generation Desktop Platform Software License and Maintenance Agreement
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to obtain, on a sole source basis, additional Siebel Software licenses and maintenance agreements over a period of 20 months to support the CMS Next Generation Desktop (NGD) project.   


CMS conducted an open competition that resulted in the development of the Next Generation Desktop application on a Siebel platform.  The Siebel application is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software product. To support the rollout of the application and the Virtual Call Center Strategy (VCS) as it proceeds, it is necessary to purchase additional Siebel licenses.  Since the development of the base application has been completed on the Siebel Service eHealthcare platform, the sole source purchase of Siebel licenses for the rollout of the software to the call centers is necessary to accommodate the NGD application platform.  The NGD application is a web-based, zero footprint application that will be used to respond to Medicare inquiries from beneficiaries and providers/suppliers.  


There are no known Siebel resellers than Siebel itself.  Entities that wish to demonstrate their capability to provide the service stated above should submit their qualifications in sufficient detail for the Government to make a determination regarding their assertion.  Submissions should be addressed to the attention of Debra Hoffman, Contract Specialist, Fax number (410) 786-9088, Email dhoffman2@cms.hhs.gov.  Questions should also be directed to Debra Hoffman at (410)-786-0517

The notice stated that this was an OMB Circular A-76 Direct Conversion with Cost Comparison Study.  Subsequent to those notices, a Presolicitation Notice under Solicitation No. NRCS-14-GA-03 was issued on May 30, 2003 and a delay notice issued on June 16, 2003 for the same services which stated that the study was conducted under the OMB A-76 Circular.   Currently, Government personnel provide these services.  Prospecive offers were advised that the Government reserved the right to retain the work in-house and make no award of contract.  Since the Presolicitation Notice under NRCS-14-GA-03 was issued after the Revision of OMB Circular A-76 was made known, the NRCS is notifing prospective offers of the transition of this study to the streamlined competition procedures described in the revised OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003.  Certain deviations may be incorporated, as approved by OMB, for retention of previous cost rules and procedures that were in effect prior to the issuance of the revised circular.  NRCS is further transitioning from the Direct Conversion with Cost Comparison Study to the USDA Express Review Study under the Circular.  Under this method, no solicitation will be issued, therefore, Solicitation No. NRCS-14-GA-03 is withdrawn.  If after the study is completed, the cost of in-house performance by Government personnel for the services is determined to be the most cost effective, the services will remain in house and continue to be performed by Government employees.  If the results of the study indicate that contract performance is less costly than performance in house, the Government will prepare the necessary documents to solicit the services from outside sources.   This notice is the first of two notices to be placed in the Fedbizopps to assure proper notification of the transition.

<SUBJECT>R--OMB Circular A-76 Commercial Activities Study of Mail/Supply Services Transition of USDA Express Review
<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) originally set aside the mail/supply services position in Athens, Georgia as a Direct Conversion with JWOD under OMB Circular A-76.   No sources sought notices were placed in Fedbizopps for this position because in FAR  JWOD  set asides do not require publishing in the Fedbizopps.  Prior to preparing and issuing a solicitation, the Revised OMB Circular A-76 was issued effective May 29, 2003.  The revised OMB Circular A-76 does not allow direct conversions, therefore, the transition into the streamlined competition procedures of the revised circular are in effect.  Since the NRCS had tentatively made a decision previously, the NRCS is further transitioning into using the USDA Express Review Study under the OMB Circular A-76.  Certain deviations may be incorporated, as approved by OMB, for retention of the previous cost rules or procedures. Under this method, no solicitation will be issued.  If after the study is completed, the in-house for the services are determined to be the most cost effective, the servicies will remain in house and countinue to be performed by a Government employee.  If the results of the study indicate that contract perrformance is less costly than performance in house,  the Government will prepare the necessary documents to solicit the services through a JWOD set aside with Cost Comparison.   This notice is the first of two notices to be posted in the Fedbizopps to assure notification of the transition.

<SUBJECT>A -- Scientific, Technical and Logistics Support for the Division of Extramural Activities (DEA)
<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH, intends to negotiate with the Logical Technical Services (LTS) Corporation under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1), Unique Capabilities, for a modification to continue Contract No. N01-AI-05393, awarded as a small business set-aside under NAICS Code 541519 (formerly SIC Code 7379) for the period of 12/01/1999 through 11/30/2003.  Until we have a complete understanding of the impact of changes in the overall operation of NIAID, as directed by NIH and DHHS, and the upcoming implementation of A-76, we are unable at this time to develop a Statement of Work for the planned recompetition of this requirement. The negotiated modification will provide for a level of increased effort over a period of 18 months, and extension of the current period of performance.  Under the proposed extension, the Contractor will continue to provide technical, scientific and logistics support currently required in the areas of Internet and Intranet site development and testing; records management, advisory council and committee support, peer review, support in the grants and contracts areas, and scientific coding for research activities. LTS Corporation is uniquely qualified to continue to fulfill these requirements by virtue of their performance on the current contract.    If the proposed extended effort were to be awarded to another contractor at this time, the consequential interruption in the operation of the Division of Extramural Activities would result in unacceptable delays and failure to make congressionally mandated awards in Fiscal Years 2003 and 2004.  Therefore, no other services will satisfy Agency requirements.  Because all work in this contract requires contractor staff to work on-site in DEA, NIAID, facilities some or all of the time and to meet frequently with DEA staff, offerors and their proposed staff, consultants and subcontractors must be located within a 50 mile radius or a 1 hour drive of DEA’s offices.  Offerors who submit capability statements must demonstrate their ability to assume the work without undue interruption to the support currently being provided to the DEA and without unnecessary duplication of cost and effort.  If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting the information required by Numbered Note 22 on/before the closing date noted in this announcement.  See Government-wide Numbered Notes 22 and 26.  No collect calls will be accepted.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotations.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations.

<DESC>The Specialized Information Services (SIS) Division under the National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Endre Jofoldi, Kaposvar, 7400, Pazmany Peter, 108, Hungary, for the continuation of the professional services under current NLM Purchase Order 467-MZ-202314.  SIS has been a centralized resource for accessing information on Toxicology and Environmental Health via the TOXNET system.  The SIS TOXNET software and databases are hosted on NLM/SIS servers.  TOXNET content comes from SIS and NLM, as well as other Government agencies and third party sources.  As such, TOXNET requires ongoing data conversions and regular updates.  Increasingly useful and reliable toxicology on environmental health information is available on the World Wide Web via Web-accessible databases outside of NLM/SIS.  In order to continue its mission as a focal point for providing access to toxicology and environmental health information of high quality and currency, SIS is planning to continue to pursue the development of a Toxicology and Environmental Health Portal System to provide distributed access to diverse toxicology and environmental health databases on the World Wide Web.  In order to add increased recall and precision to the retrieval capabilities of the SIS Toxicology and Environmental Health Portal, SIS needs to operationally integrate and further develop a variety of NLP (Natural Language Processing) tools and techniques available as a result of prior R&D work in the division and NLM.  Building on specialized expertise and work on building NLP and HTML/XML parsers for the successfully implemented ToxPortal pilot project, the contractor will integrate and further develop Automatic system and database access configuration procedures; Text parsing and summarization routines; Specialized medical and chemical name parsers; Advanced results merging and ranking procedures; Sophisticated text and concept analysis routines; Open Source and COTS information retrieval tools for indexing and accessing specialized data; Open Source and COTS information visualization tools; Thin client technologies for multi platform and multi-browser single PC or PDA ToxPortal acess deliverables; Executables of the software and API documentation.  The deliverables will be provided to SIS as they become available during the performance of the work.  The final executables of the software and the API documentation will be delivered to SIS by December 31, 2004.  Work will be performed in Hungary.  
	
This service will be procured under FAR Part 12 (Commercial Items.)

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK FOR RESEARCH ON INDEX NUMBERS FOR VARIABLES CALCULATED AS DIFFERENCES


OVERVIEW

The US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has a requirement for a contractor to investigate the theory and practice of index-number problems involving values calculated as differences.  The Contractor shall furnish the findings of this investigation in three Final Reports that review the literature on these problems, identify common practices for handling them, and recommend feasible improvements to the methods now used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).  One report shall investigate and develop solutions for measuring real change in inventories, real net fixed investment, and real net exports in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA's).  A second report shall investigate and develop solutions for measuring real GDP, command-basis real GNP, terms of trade, and real wealth.  A third report shall investigate and develop solutions for measuring real value added by industry and constant-dollar annual input-output tables in the GDP-by-industry and annual input-output accounts.  The order in which these reports are completed and provided to BEA shall be at the discretion of the Contractor. 

BACKGROUND
In the NIPA's, three important variables can change sign because they are defined as a difference.  The sign of change in inventories depends on the balance between production and sales; the sign of net fixed investment depends on the balance between gross fixed investment and consumption of fixed capital; and the sign of net exports depends on the balance between exports and imports.  Negative values may make the Fisher index number formula usually used by BEA impossible to calculate.  Moreover, regardless of whether negative values are present, the most meaningful way to calculate index numbers involving these variables is unclear. 

The subtractions involved in calculating change in inventories, net fixed investment, and net exports can pose problems in the measurement of real GDP and price deflators for real GDP, and in the measurement of command-basis real GNP and terms of trade.  (See NIPA table 1.11.)  Furthermore, problems in the measurement of real fixed investment have implications for the measurement of real wealth.  Real wealth may be measured in terms of real purchasing power, or in terms of the real capital stock that it represents.

Finally, negative numbers can potentially occur in the measurement of real value added by industry when real value added is measured as the difference between deflated output and deflated intermediate inputs-that is, the double-deflation procedure.  Related problems occur in the calculations of constant-dollar annual input-output tables.  However, unlike real change in inventories or real net exports, measures of real value added by industry can be cast in a production-based framework.
