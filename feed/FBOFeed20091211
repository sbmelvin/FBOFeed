<DESC>The 642 ELSS proposes to execute, by means of other than full and open competition, a modification to the IBDSS IDIQ contract F19628-03-D-0019 to extend the Ordering Period to 31 December 2009.
This action will enable follow-on support for AFCENT Security Forces in support of operational deployments in Southwest Asia (SWA), area of responsibility (AOR) for a period of 6 months by extending Order 0076 from 29 November 2009 to 28 May 2010.  Due to the present situation in Afghanistan and Iraq specifically, SWA in general, and the urgent nature of force protection as a whole, the requirements necessitate the need to continue support that AFCENT is receiving from incumbent contractor, Northrop Grumman (NG).  This action will provide the continuation of  Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)  and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)  support currently awarded under the IBDSS contract F19628-03-D-0019 Order 0076.  
Any disruption, or elimination of the maintenance activities to the mission critical Intrusion Detection Equipment (IDE) would jeopardize the operations and base defense protection systems and subsystems which enable the protection of vital Protection Level (PL) assets.
The authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), in order to avoid unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirements. The underlying action is an extension of services under FAR Part 17, Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services

<DESC>RECOVERY – Infrastructure Upgrades for z9 Mainframe Computer Systems
Solicitation Number: 
Agency: Department of the Treasury
Office: Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
Location: National Office Procurement (OS:A:P)
Synopsis: 
RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE to GTSI, CORP. FOR REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.  In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, Pub. Law 111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of intent to issue a modification to contract number TIRNO-09-K-00218, to purchase additional Millions of Instructions Per Second (MIPS) in order to upgrade ASG software that the IRS already owns.  The ASG software supports several mission critical tax applications, including the Master File and Business Systems Modernization applications.  These applications contain sensitive taxpayer data and the increased workload volumes resulting from ARRA requirements require increased processing capacity on the IBM z9 mainframe systems that host them.  These increased workloads will include tax changes such as: the Making Work Pay Tax Credit, First-Time Homebuyer Credit Expansion, education benefits, Health Coverage Tax Credit, Money Back for New Vehicle Purchases, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, COBRA Health Insurance Continuation Subsidy, Net Operating Loss Carry back and Municipal Bond Programs.

Currently, the IRS uses ASG software as a means of Information Technology (IT) support, preventive and remedial maintenance.  This software supports the three IRS computing centers, located in West Virginia, Tennessee and Detroit. Maintenance and support of this software is essential in order to avoid disruption to the daily processing of taxpayer information performed at the computing centers in support of the IRS’ modernization efforts.  No other software has been found that can replace the functionality of the ASG software.  Therefore, the IRS will increase the ASG software MIPS from 14,300 to 14,600 MIPS.  The increase will be accomplished by issuance of a modification to a previously competed delivery order (referenced above) awarded to GTSI, Corp., a large business.  The modification will be executed as a firm fixed-price action and has an anticipated value less than the micro-purchase threshold.  The existing delivery order was competed in accordance with the procedures set forth in FAR Subpart 8.404 for use of General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules.  Small businesses were solicited but one was not selected for award because GTSI, Corp. was the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.

Agency: Department of the Treasury
Office: Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
Location: National Office Procurement (OS:A:P)
Synopsis: 
RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE TO GSA SCHEDULE HOLDERS FOR THE RESEASONS DESCRIBED BELOW. In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 Pub.L.111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of intent to issue a Request For Quote (RFQ) to purchase additional Millions of Instructions Per Second (MIPS) in order to upgrade Catalog Recovery Plus software that the IRS already owns.  The Catalog Recovery Plus software supports several mission critical tax applications, including the Master File and Business Systems Modernization applications.  These applications contain sensitive taxpayer data and the increased workload volumes resulting from ARRA requirements require increased processing capacity on the IBM z9 mainframe systems that host them.  These increased workloads will include tax changes such as: the Making Work Pay Tax Credit, First-Time Homebuyer Credit Expansion, education benefits, Health Coverage Tax Credit and Money Back for New Vehicle Purchases, Work Opportunity tax credit, COBRA Health Insurance Continuation Subsidy, Net Operating Loss Carry back and Municipal Bond Programs.   
Currently, the IRS operates the Catalog Recovery Plus software to accommodate the General Purpose Central Processor (GPCP).  The additional computing power and associated system software maintenance upgrade will be used to process the additional tax forms and workloads associated with the new ARRA requirements.  No other known software has been found that can replace the functionality of the Catalog Recovery Plus Software.  Therefore, the IRS will increase its capacity of MIPS from 6,413 to 6,703 MIPS. The work is planned to be accomplished via a competitive RFQ in accordance with the procedures set forth in FAR Subpart 8.404 for use of General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules.  Small businesses and resellers of Catalog Recovery Plus software and support who have a GSA Schedule contract will be solicited.  A firm-fixed price order will be placed against the GSA schedule contract with the lowest priced, technically acceptable solution that represents the best value to meet the Government’s needs.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, 800 Centennial Avenue, Piscataway, NY 08854-3911 for a service agreement for the BC 3000 Processing Unit, and the BC X Processing Unit 110V.  The period of performance is for a year with the potential for two option years.  The Dynamics of Macromolecular Assembly group is conducting collaborative research in the characterization of the thermodynamic and dynamic aspects of proteins and protein interactions.  One of the major tools applied in the research is the AKTA Purifier10.  The AKTA Purifier10 is a chromatography system used to purify and separate proteins from buffer contaminants and from other protein in solutions.  After samples are run through the AKTA Purifier10, it is insured that the protein under study is a pure product and at its most optimum condition.  It is essential to the research to maintain the AKTA Purifier10 in the best possible working condition.  Routine maintenance is performed to keep the AKTA clean and running well, however, many calibrations and repairs require a qualified expert.  The maintenance contract covers unlimited repairs, travel, parts, labor, and includes one Preventive Maintenance visit per year.  The Preventive Maintenance visit saves valuable time and money as it trouble shoots many possible problems which could occur.  In addition, service technicians have been prompt, helpful, and extremely qualified when called for repairs.  GE Healthcare is the sole provider of this service contract and only GE Healthcare Field Service Engineers are qualified to work on this equipment and their software.  This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements.

The period of performance is for a year with the potential for two option years.  The Dynamics of Macromolecular Assembly group is conducting collaborative research in the characterization of the thermodynamic and dynamic aspects of proteins and protein interactions.  One of the major techniques applied n the research is surface Plasmon technology which enables the ability to study intricate protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions.  This is a complex system that involved accurate and precise fluid flow and delivery and must be carefully calibrated to ensure optimum reliability.  The two equipment systems that allow the ability to perform surface Plasmon experiments are the Biacore-X and the Biacore 3000.  It is essential that the Biacore-X and Biacore 3000 are maintained in the best possible working condition.  The equipment is carefully taken care of and maintenance is performed day to day.  Many of the calibrations and adjustments need to be performed by a qualified expert.  The contract includes one preventative maintenance visit for the Biacore-X and two preventative maintenance visits for the Biacore 3000 which alone saves time and money in trouble shooting and possible equipment downtime.  The price of the contract covers all costs related to repair and maintenance including parts, travel and labor.  Biacore service technicians are prompt, efficient, and very helpful.  GE Healthcare is the sole provider for the service contract and only GE Healthcare Field Service Engineers are qualified to work on this equipment, including the software.

Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SOLNBR>233NDMS-01
<CONTACT>Michele Namoski, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-2475, Email SHELLEY.NAMOSKI@PSC.HHS.GOV
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) sometime early in 2010, on behalf of the DHHS, Office of the Secretary, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) Office of Preparedness and Emergency Operations (OPEO) National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) Operations Branch.

I.  Purpose:  Due to the location of the center of government in Washington, DC, NDMS, working with several Washington DC metropolitan area fire departments and the Council of Governments (COG), has developed a specialized medical response team specifically for use in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. NDMS had designated this specialized team as the National Medical Response Team-National Capital Region (NMRT-NCR) and assisted in developing this team as a WMD response unit to support the Federal response to a terrorism incident within the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The Washington Metropolitan area is defined by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments as the National Capital Region (NCR), which is in turn defined as the following jurisdictions: The City of Alexandria, Arlington County, The District of Columbia, Fairfax County, Loudoun County, Montgomery County, Prince George’s County, Prince William County, and all included municipalities. The National Capital Region was created pursuant to the National Capital Planning Act of 1952 (Title 40, U.S.C., Sec. 71).  

HHS plans to enter into a contract with a qualified organization that can meet the mission of providing mass or individual decontamination of victims within the National Capital Region contaminated by chemical, biological, or radiological agents; provide medical care and/or stabilization for these victims; assist in triage and treatment before and after decontamination; provide technical assistance to local EMS officials; and, pre-deploy when directed, as a result of a credible or potential terrorist threat. Throughout this notice, the terms “qualified organization” of “organization” is considered synonymous with “NMRT-NCR” and “Contractor.”  

Though the RFP will not be a set-aside, all qualified Small Business Concerns, including 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women owned small business are encouraged to submit a proposal.

The resulting contract will be for the readiness, preparedness, and response services of the qualified organization.  The organization shall be ready to deploy personnel and material for immediate use in responding to a WMD or mass casualty incident within the NCR.  The vehicles, products and other specialized materials and stored and maintained under this contract shall be known as the “HHS WMD Response Cache”.  The exact location of this storage site shall be “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” and shall be referred to as the “HHS WMD Response Cache Site.” 

The purpose of this contract is twofold: To assure the readiness of the qualified organization so that it is prepared to provide qualified, competent personnel in support of ASPR/OPEO response requirements under the National Response Framework (NRF).   This includes preparations for incidents involving WMD, National Special Security Events (NSSE) and/or other designated major disasters, or emergencies, including public health emergencies.  This contract enables the qualified organization to maintain a condition of high operational readiness and identifies key areas for organizational personnel to focus continued preparedness efforts.  

The second purpose is to facilitate the deployment and services of the qualified organization in support of public health emergencies (PHE), National Special Security Events (NSSE), and other special events in the National Capital Region. This statement of work sets forth the requirements for activation, response, command and control, and reimbursement for services of the qualified organization during special events, public health emergencies, and periods of heightened readiness for potential terrorist attacks, in particular, for the response to WMD incidents.  When directed by the Contracting Officer, the qualified organization shall pre-stage or deploy personnel and material for immediate use in responding to a WMD or mass casualty incident within the NCR.  

This contract will have the following objectives:  provide definitive administrative and program management, support, training, and equipment cache preparedness, and to provide for cache maintenance.

RapidEYE can collect broad-area medium resolution (5-meter) imagery with a wide swath width of large areas for monitoring any place on Earth.  MDA has the exclusive license to develop, market, and produce the downlink reception and processing algorithms and systems, and is therefore the only contractor able to perform the requested effort.  This action is beingdone non-competitively based on 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, because the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice and is not a request for proposals.  This sources sought is to determine if there are 8a small businesses that are qualified and capable of preventive and corrective land rehabilitation, repair, and or maintenance practices that reduces the long-term impacts of training and testing on installation lands. It includes training area redesign and/or reconfiguration to meet training requirements at government owned facilities at Fort Bliss, Texas. This program supports sound natural and cultural resource management practices to provide stewardship of land assets, while sustaining those assets to support training, testing, and other installation missions. The Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) Program consists of four major elements: 1) Training Requirements Integration (TRI), 2) Range and Training Land Assessment (RTLA). 3) Land Rehabilitation and Maintenance (LRAM), 4) Sustainable Range Awareness (SRA), plus a GIS component supporting all four ITAM elements.<BR>The major effort under this program will include:<BR>1)	Channel Stabilization-Hard Lined:  A natural or constructed waterway that is lined with erosion-resistant concrete or stone with the area above the hardened or permanent lining vegetated or otherwise stabilized.<BR>2)	Check Dams: Small dam constructed in a gully or other small channel to decrease the flow velocity, minimize channel scour, and promote deposition of sediment.<BR>3)	Culverts:  A culvert consists of a metal, plastic, or concrete pipe through which surface water can flow under roads, trails, embankments, and maneuver structures.<BR>4)	Dust Control Methods and Palliatives:  Actions or methods that reduce the erosive effects of wind on dry soils.  Dust control measures include the application of chemical tackifier or soil binder, the establishment of vegetation, soil inoculation, the use of aggregate material, and/or the combination thereof.  Dust palliatives include water absorbing products, organic petroleum products, organic non-petroleum products, synthetic polymer products, clay additives, etc.<BR>5)	Erosion Control Blankets or Mats:  Erosion control blankets or mats are designed to augment the processes of nature by protecting soil, seeds, topsoil, and fertilizer until vegetation is firmly established.  <BR>6)	Gabions:  Gabions are rectangular or cylindrical wire-mesh cages that are filled with rock and wired together to form a protective, but permeable structure for slope stabilization and erosion control.<BR>7)	Grade Stabilization Structures:  A structure used to stabilize the grade or to control head cutting in natural or artificial channels.  Commonly utilized grade stabilization structures include toe walls and drop spillways.  A toe wall is a mechanical system that functions like a weir and contains a non-enclosed water over fall.  A drop spillway is a mechanical system, which lowers water through a box or pipe structure.  This system internally dissipates most of the energy produced by the water.  Concrete catch basin, plastic drop pipes, and steel slopes culverts are all examples of drop spillways.<BR>8)	Gully Plugs:  Gully plugs can be comprised of earthen or hardened materials.  Gully plugs prevent the eroding and down cutting of gully heads while allowing sediment to backfill; thus, creating an improved micro-environment for the establishment of vegetative cover.  Earthen gully plugs are typically constructed from topsoil, native or non-invasive grass seed, and certified weed free straw and are established in a gully after appropriate land shaping is completed.  Hardened gully plugs (otherwise known as Maneuver Access Structures  MAS) are typically constructed from hard angular rock and function as weirs, while simultaneously providing a dismounted or mounted troop crossing.<BR>9)	Hardened Tactical Areas and Trails:  Concentrate and maintain areas of disturbance associated with training to allow access to trails, firing points, and maneuver and tactical areas (e.g. bivouac, forward operating base (FOB), tactical operational center (TOC)).<BR>10)	Land Shaping:  Land shaping is moving soil around to planned grades to provide suitable topography for range activities.<BR>11)	Level Spreader:  Level spreader is an earthen, vegetated outlet for dikes, diversions, or other concentrated runoff, which is slightly depressed allowing water to collect and then disperse uniformly over the surrounding vegetated area.<BR>12)	Low-Water Crossing:  A low-water crossing is where a road, without a bridge, dips across dry, intermittent or low-flow channels.<BR>13)	Sediment Barrier:  Sediment barriers, such as silt fences, straw bales or wattles, brush barriers, and coir fiber are structures placed perpendicular to the slope of the land to decrease the velocity of overland flow, or low to moderate channel flows, and prevent off-site or downstream transport of sediment.<BR>14)	Sediment Basin:  A depression formed from the construction of a barrier or dam built to retain sediment and debris.  Sediment basins are permanent structures.<BR>15)	Sediment Trap:  A sediment trap is a temporary ponding area formed either by excavation of a depression or by constructing an earthen embankment.  The ponding area allows sediment to settle out before the runoff is discharged through a stone outlet.<BR>16)	Seeding:  Temporary or permanent seeding that produces a short-term or long-term protective vegetative cover.  Seeding is applicable wherever disturbed soils exist.  The method will depend on the site conditions.<BR>17)	Signage and Fencing:  Downrange signage and fencing are controls used to limit access around safety hazards.<BR>18)	Turnouts and Aprons:  Turnouts and aprons are transitions from flow diversions or channels that convey concentrated, high-velocity flows to discharges into undisturbed areas with low-velocity non-erosive flows.  Turnouts and aprons are designed to convert concentrated flow into sheet flow  NOT to filter or retain sediments.  Turnouts may be a ditch, trench, or other conveyance used to divert stormwater runoff away from a road surface or adjacent ditch into undisturbed areas of vegetation.  Turnouts may be used in conjunction with aprons or with level spreaders (see the Level Spreaders BMP).  Aprons consist of permanent layers of loose angular stones or aggregate material with a filter fabric or granular underlining placed over an erodible soil surface.<BR>19)	Vegetative Rock Surface:  A vegetated rock surface is a layer of rock, confined or unconfined, through which vegetation grows.<BR>20)	Water Bars:  A shallow trench with a mound or a berm that provides cross drainage and intercepts runoff from trails, roads, and firebreaks.<BR>21)	Wattles: Wattles are made of live material, and are fabrication of poles interwoven with slender branches withes, or reeds used for erosion and sediment control. Generall, wattles are used for sediment control on slopes with limited to low-volume flows from smaller storm events. <BR><BR><BR> The Mission & Installation Contracting Command, Directorate of Contracting, Fort Bliss, Texas is seeking information to verify there are qualified and capable 8a sources available to perform rehabilitation on Fort Bliss, Texas.

This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. 

(a) The Forest Service contemplates conducting a two-phase design-build acquisition using the procedures of FAR Subpart 36.3 for the design and construction of a new facility on approximately three acres of a 7.5 acre parcel adjacent to the University of Alaska Southeast (UAS) campus 10.6 miles north of downtown Juneau. The purpose for the proposed action is to develop an office and laboratory space, and warehouse along with related road access and parking. Construction would provide consolidated office, laboratories, warehouse, and dry storage space for permanent and seasonal employees assigned to the Juneau Laboratory. The proposed two or three-story 15,000 square-foot office (building footprint estimated at 7,500 square-feet maximum) and laboratories will occupy the land below the paved footpath that connects the University Library with the Mendenhall Loop Road. A 50 to 60 space parking lot (approximately 10,000 square-feet) and a warehouse with dry storage and a shop (an estimated 4,500 square-feet) will be built on the parcel above the footpath or above the existing road (location to be determined). The new office and laboratories will house 22 permanent employees and up to 25 temporary employees. The facility will be built over a two year period due to funding availability. Project Design is scheduled to begin in 2010, and construction in 2011-2012. Phase 3 of the project includes building an additional wing to house the R10 Regional Office. This phase is not part of this project at this time. However the building design will be flexible enough to accommodate this potential future need. The estimated magnitude of the project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. 

(b) The Forest Service desires that firms interested in this project as a prime contractor identify themselves by the submission of a brief white paper. We ask for this paper to be submitted as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) attachment in an e-mail to Project Manager Donna Wians (dwians@fs.fed.us), with a cc: to Deborah Strickland (dstrickland@fs.fed.us) and Karen Weidenbaugh (kweidenbaugh@fs.fed.us) by close of business on December 29, 2009. The white paper and any accompanying cover letter should be brief (no more than seven (7) pages), should not exceed 1MB in size, and should be written with the intent of helping the Forest Service craft its acquisition approach so we can enhance our ability to obtain the construction services at reasonable prices and with efficiency in contractor proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award. The white paper should address the following topics:
(1) The firm's name, address, DUNS number, and point of contact information;
(2) The firm's size status, such as small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or 8(a) contractor;
(3) The firm's experience as a prime contractor in design-build acquisitions and as a prime contractor for work similar to this project;
(4) Advice on whether the Forest Service should issue one solicitation covering both phases, or two solicitations in sequence;
(5) Advice on the timetable that the acquisition should follow in order to provide for a contract award at the end of phase two by September 2010;
(6) Advice on the phase one evaluation factors, including the level of design work the Forest Service should seek from competing contractors as part of the phase one effort;
(7) Advice on the phase two evaluation factors;
(8) Comments on the suitability of this project for use of the two-phase selection process; and
(9) Other advice, recommendations, or cautions for the Forest Service as we consider a two-phase design-build acquisition approach for this project.

(c) The Forest Service is not scheduling a pre-solicitation conference at this time. We hope all interested parties will share helpful information with us through the white papers requested above. The Forest Service has not yet made a definitive decision to issue a solicitation, and it has not made any definitive decisions regarding work scope, acquisition strategy, extent of competition, NAICS code, and so forth. The information we learn from the white papers will help us as we make these decisions. Other exchanges with industry may occur in the near future; this may include a pre-solicitation conference or one-on-one meetings with some or all white paper submitters. Your participation and assistance through the submission of a white paper is appreciated

The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a dual tilting axis, analytical specimen holder (double-tilt holder) for fragile specimens.  The holder must be compatible with an FEI Company scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) equipped with a SuperTwin pole piece and an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer. The results of this market research will be used to identify vendors that are capable of meeting the required specifications and delivery date. Requests for price quotations and delivery schedules will be generated base on the information obtained. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a multi-analysis system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

NIST has a need for a double-tilt holder that would meet the following requirements:

1.	The cradle of the holder must be able to load and hold extremely fragile samples, measuring 3.05 millimeters in diameter and edge thicknesses ranging from 20 to 200 micrometers.  The vendor would be expected to provide detailed description of sample mounting and exchange.

2.	The holder must have a minimum tilting range of +/- 30 degrees for both alpha and beta tilt axes.  The holder must display the beta tilt angle on a controller.

3.	The holder must be constructed of materials compatible with investigations by X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (i.e., materials that produce low X-ray background).

4.	The holder must provide a means to measure the STEM’s incident electron probe current (e.g., a Faraday cup).  NIST will provide a picoammeter to display the current.

5.	The holder must be compatible with an FEI Titan 80-300 STEM with SuperTwin pole piece and allow safe, stable operation at 300 kV (CompuStage, vacuum systems, low drift rate, etc.).  The vendor would be expected to provide a holder while guaranteeing that the STEM continues to perform to the original manufacturer’s (FEI Company) specifications.

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your company’s size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture double-tilt holders are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice (SS). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small business; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. 
The NAICS code for the project is 334413. 
The small business size standard is 500 employees. 
The purpose of the proposed acquisition is to identify qualified organizations who can provide a Chameleon Ultra II Laser System to the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB).  This system is a tunable two photon laser source for a widefield two photon excitation scope and a multiphoton selective plane illumination microscope (SPIM) is required.  For both applications, the source must provide as high an output power as possible, in order to achieve the maximum two-photon excitation efficiency.  The laser must also be wavelength tunable over a broad range, in order to ensure to properly photoactivate and then excite the fluorescently-labeled samples.  The Chameleon Ultra II is the only laser that satisfies these requirements, as it is tunable over a broad spectral range (680-1080 nm), and offers more power than competing vendors.  The Chameleon Ultra II meets the following required specifications:

Performance Specifications
-Output average power specification required is >3.3 Watt at peak of Ti:S curve, with a tuning range of 680nm to 1080nm range.  Capabilities are required across this entire tuning range to cover our current and future experiments.
-Capability for rapid wavelength changes, 40 nm/sec.
-Beam quality to specified as M2<1.1 to ensure tightest focusing capability
-Beam shape specified as better than (i.e. smaller range) ellipticity = 0.9-1.1.  A round beam ensures more efficient coupling of light from the laser into the microscope and minimal astigmatism.
-Minimum tuning range required is 680nm-1080nm inclusive without operator adjustments other than request of wavelength.  System to tune through atmospheric absorption bands > 900 nm without requirement of external gas purge.
-Pulse width approximately 140fSec, important for minimizing dispersion in applications.
-System shall have the lowest noise specifications to provide optimal images.  A noise spec of 0.5%, or less, is required.

Design
-Optimized pulse width for maximum multi-photon excitation in a typical confocal microscope.  Pulse width must typically be between 120-140fSec across the full tuning range to minimize optical pulse stretching (also called “dispersion” or “chirp”) in the laboratory’s microscope and thus give minimum pulse width and highest peak power and highest multi-photon conversion efficiency at the sample.  In order to assure minimum chirping, output pulse must be very close to the bandwidth limit.  Systems with pulse width under 100fSec are unacceptable because they have too much bandwidth and thus exhibit large pulse chirping.  Typically these short-pulse systems attempt to use excess average power to make up for pulse stretching; however, excess average power will induce more photo-damage in the laboratory’s biological samples.  To further ensure minimum pulse chirp, pulse width must be actively controlled and optimized across full tuning range.
-Hermetically-sealed construction.  Diode pumped laser systems generally degrade due to optical contamination from dust and solvents present in the lab.  It is required that the system be hermetically sealed to provide long life and minimal downtime.  Required for hermetic sealing is no exchange of gas, or dust from the lab, as evidenced by no light leakage from the interior cavity.
-Permanent alignment of head.  The laboratory focus is on laser microscopy, as opposed to basic laser research.  It is required that the design of the laser be of permanent alignment, with no ports for dist invasion, and no field alignment requirements in order to meet project deadlines.
-Design that minimizes downtime.  The Ti:S oscillator cavity must be constructed with a single-tuning-element design to eliminate all needs for adjustment, optimization, or cleaning the system.  System must include a closed-loop air filtration and recirculation unit to ensure that the cavity is free from out-gassing components, micro-dust particles, and water vapor.  System must be able to maintain less that 1% humidity at all times without external purging or other intervention.
-User-replaceable pump diodes.  Because pump diodes are the single greatest maintenance cost, diodes must be user replaceable and can be changed without the involvement of the laser head, or disturbance of any kind to the experimental set up.  Disruptions of this kind, for example, to re-thread the optical fiber through the umbilical can be avoided.
-Low noise.  Amplitude noise of the system is critical in many small signal applications.  Thus the Ti:S is pumped by a single-frequency/single-longitudinal mode pump source so that the noise spectrum will be free of chaotic noise behavior characteristic of multimode pump sources.
-Integrated spectrometer.  System has an onboard spectrometer capable of monitoring wavelength and bandwidth of Ti:S laser.  Spectrometer to be addressable via USB.
-Ultra-quiet Chiller.  System has a chiller that is all solid-state design.  Freon pump-type refrigeration units should not be acceptable as they are noisier and create greater waste heat and mechanical vibrations.  Furthermore, the chiller has the capability to be remoted up to 8 meters away for ultimate noise/heat suppression.
-System Control.  System should be user controllable either via RS232 or via the panel interface located on the power supply.

All Capability Statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Jennifer Schlegel, Contract Specialist, at schlegeljk@mail.nih.gov by December 16th. 2009, 1:00 PM, EST.  All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.  This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response.  The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate.  Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization’s qualifications to perform the work.  Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.  After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities.  However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.  No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response.  The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT, a Market Survey for written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls will be accepted.  After review of the responses submitted regarding this potential acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities if the Government intends to continue with the procurement.In preparation for a future procurement, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Engineering Service Center (ESC) is seeking to merge ASHS and MSS software capabilities into the ESS software module as well as to develop additional functionality not available in any of the software programs. Within the DoD, three explosives safety planning software applications: ASHS, ESS and MSS have been developed by the Air Force, DoD and Army, respectively, to meet specific needs of the target customer.  Each application meets the majority of those needs in their current state. As is typical of software systems however, few of them satisfy 100% of the customer requirements.  Evolving DoD needs and requirements necessitate bringing the best features of each of these software applications together into one "Best-of-Breed" system that is designed to meet the needs of explosives safety planners throughout all of the DoD. The ESS software will be expanded to include expeditionary site planning tools provided in the ASHS and MSS software packages.  Additional graphical data layers can easily be created by users and extensive graphical editing commands will be added to allow users to create or update maps to account for rapidly changing circumstances in the field.  Special tools will be added to allow the user to automate the siting of complex graphics. Additional tools will be provided to allow quick and accurate siting of new facilities inside of existing development constraints and to account for reduced separation distances provided by barricade protection.New geospatial tools will be developed to assist a user compare and update maps as they change over time. Tools will be provided to closely track changes to data so that configuration management is not lost when edits are made to copies of the 'official' map of record at any DoD installation.  Extensive wizard help commands and training aids will be developed to assist users to quickly become proficient with the use of the software and to recall how to execute software commands when the software hasn't been used for an extended period of time.A standardized site approval submittal package format will be developed that will be the same for all Services.  Tools for identifying and mitigating rule violations will be developed to allow the user to override violations with Engineering Analyses, Terrain analysis, Risk Analysis, Grandfather Clauses, or other rationale that will override a violation.Work on this project will likely require coordination with the developers of one of the software packages to be merged as graphic and non-graphic data resident in ASHSII, ESS and MSS software will need to be converted into this new data model.  Installations conducting explosives safety siting using any of these software programs (ESS, ASHSII & MSS) will need assistance converting their data into the new data model developed under this tasking.This effort requires experience in the following areas:a.	A thorough understanding of the data attributes used in the ESS, ASHS and MSS database models, as a new data model will be developed that join all three models into one.b.	Knowledge and experience in the application of DoD and Army, Navy and Air Force explosive safety criteria.c.	Understanding in the use and application of ESS and MSS software and certified in the use of the software.d.	Understanding in the use, application and creation of ESRI shapefile and geodatabase file structures, experience developing and using ArcGIS software applications and experience programming with Arc Objects and Visual Basic.NET.e.	Database development and database administration for Oracle, SQL Server and Microsoft Access.f.	Experience in the application of ADO.NET interfaces with Visual Basic.NET for Oracle, SQL Server and Microsoft Access.g.	Experience using AutoCAD, Autodesk Map, and Micro Station applications.h.	Experience converting data from AutoCAD, Autodesk Map, and Micro Station to ESRI GIS formats.Interested sources should respond by completing the attached INFORMATION SUMMARY MATRIX document detailing the following:  Company's ability to fulfill the requirements descried herein; list of projects - similar in size and score - to the current requirement: whether the company is a large business, small business and/or certified as 8(a), HUBZone, et cetera; and, whether your registration in CCR is current.  This announcement is not a commitment by the government to issue for a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  It will, however, be used as a first step for evaluating ESS Enhancement alternatives.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541511- Computer software analysis and design services, custom -with a business size standard of $25 Million.  Offerors (whether you are a large or small business) who have the capability to perform this work are invited to complete the accompanying questionnaire.  The questionnaire must be received by the Government no later than 5:00 p.m., PST, on 4 January 2010 via email to andrea.brooks@navy.mil.  Complete information must be submitted.  The Government will not contact the concern for clarification of information.  This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government will not provide a "debrief" on the results of this survey.  All information submitted will be held in a confidential manner and will only be used for the purpose intended.

The current telephone numbers for the Region III office are 630-829-9500 thru 9999.  These are brought to the PBX via 3 PRI trunk groups of 24 channels each (23 voice and 1 for signaling).  In addition, Region III will be adding 1 PRI trunk to supply video conferencing.  This would be a total of 4 PRI trunk groups required for Region III.  There are also 22 POTS lines which are not routed through the PBX on a separate T1 circuit and are used for voice and data lines on a routine basis.  

Capability Sought

The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing telecommunication services to support data voice and video connectivity.  Included in the telecommunication service would be emergency and backup services.  These services shall: support voice, data, and video connectivity at various speeds; interface with the Fujitsu 9600 PBX system or Avaya G650; include unblocked access and interface into the Federal Telecommunications System (FTS) 2001 and Network environment for long distance service, and interface with commercial long distance carriers.  The Contractor shall provide number portability for all phone numbers currently in use at the Region III location.  


The commercial organization should have staff that has knowledge and/or practical experience 
	in the following areas: performing installation and maintenance of specialized equipment such as fiber optics; cable design, fabrication, installation, and removal; fault isolation techniques, trouble-shooting, diagnostic equipment utilization, initiation of corrective action, and ability to distinguish and interpret color codes and identify circuit/line termination points.

<DESC><p style="mso-line-height-alt: 0pt">The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) is inviting contractors to an Industry Day on Tuesday, January 26, 2010 at 1250 H Street NW, 2<sup>nd</sup> Floor Training Room, Washington DC 20005 from 8AM to 11 AM.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of this meeting is for FRTIB to receive information on industry best practices, education and advice options and capabilities from vendors offering financial education and/or advice to participants in defined contribution plans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There will also be an opportunity for one-on-one interface with FRTIB program management and contracting personnel in private, pre-arranged one-hour sessions later in the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /></span><br />To attend, interested vendors must register online at this site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Registration closes on Friday, January 15, 2010 at the close of the business day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>This participant-directed education/advice would principally support the tax decision, but might also include a component of general financial/retirement counseling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tools used might include a spectrum of options including, but not limited to written collateral, web-based tools, telephonic customer service support and individual counseling.</p>

<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, VA, intends to modify contract M67854-05-D-6014 with General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GDOTS), St. Petersburg, FL to add a firm fixed price line item for the purchase of spare parts to support twenty M327 Mortars, twenty ammunition trailers, forty prime movers and 40 light strike vehicles using Statutory authority for this sole source purchase under Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The spare parts are in support of initial order of spare parts for the Internally Transportable Vehicles (ITV) for the Expeditionary Fire Support System. GD-OTS is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), and sole producer of the ITV. The original contract was competed. The ITV consists of over 100,000 parts and GD-OTS already has an established supply chain for those parts for the production of the vehicles. They also have procedures in place for the acceptance, inspection and transfer of the parts to the ICLS contractor, Tec-Masters. The majority of the parts are not in the Government supply system. Provisioning for the ITV is underway and is expected to take at least one year. Until provisioning is complete the parts will not be available through the government supply chain and even when provisioning is complete, 10 - 15% of the parts required modification by the OEM after procurement from their suppliers. This is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested companies may submit affirmative response to the requirement by Friday, 18 December 2009 to the following email address: brittney.parker@usmc.mil. No telephone requests will be honored.

These systems include local area networks, web sites, databases, other electronic records, e-mail accounts, other electronic data transfer mechanisms and computer software.  The employees of these contracted system administrators sign nondisclosure agreements obligating them not to reveal information contained in files, documents, computers or systems that they administer. However, unless such information is protected in some way, contracted system administrators do have the ability to access such information.  For further information on security issues, see http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/acqinfo/ebidnotice.htm  <BR><BR>     (b) Potential contractors as well as any other parties are thus advised to take steps needed to prevent access by contracted system administrators to information submitted electronically to the Government.

The objective of the NLRB is to select the offer that represents the best value to the government while meeting or exceeding the requirements. All evaluation factors and their relative importance are set forth in this solicitation. A site visit of the facility may be conducted prior to award. The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance. An integrated assessment of quotes using all evaluation factors found in the solicitation will be the basis for award. The award may be made based on the initial submission, with or without discussion, so contractors should submit quotes that clearly meet or exceed the requirements of the SOW. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the NLRB. All quotes must confirm in their offer that the facility is compliant with the Hotel and Motel Fire and Safety Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391) (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) and the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) (Public Law 101-336)(42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.)</p>
<p>The NLRB is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales taxes in quotes for which the Federal Government is exempt.</p>
<p>To be eligible for an award, the contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. A contractor can contact the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423 or email at http://www.ccr.gov. A DUNS (Dun and Bradstreet) number is required in order to register.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA: The award will be made to the responsible quote whose offer is evaluated as the best value to the Government based on the factors set forth below. Quotes that exceed the NLRB requirements may receive additional consideration under Technical Capabilities. These factors are listed in order of importance.</p>
<p>1. Technical: <br />(a) Quote will be evaluated for ability to provide all contract requirements, the ability to provide required services on the dates specified, and the size and layouts of meeting rooms and conference office space.<br />(b) Lodging Rooms: their size, layout, appearance, and amenities (e.g., no charge for local calls or use of internet/WIFI connections).<br />(c) Hotel Facilities/Meeting Room: The quality and appearance of the hotel facilities; the convenience of the general session meeting room location and office space; the atmosphere of the general session room (size, windows, light, sound, obstructions, disruptive construction, etc.); availability and quality of complimentary onsite parking; cash bar and menu selections and A/V equipment.<br />(d) Location: Walking distance to a variety of restaurants, commuting ease from O'Hare Airport, safety of hotel neighborhood, and within a 10-mile radius of Michigan Avenue.</p>

<p>CLIN 005 Miscellaneous Expenses (e.g., extra AV equipment, copying of papers, additional meeting room space, etc.)</p>
<p>All non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price; however, as quotes become more equal in their technical merit, the proposed price may become the determining factor for award.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) to negotiate and award a contract on an un-restricted, competitive basis for the maintenance service of an FEI CM120 Transmission Electron Microscope.  The period of performance is for a year with potential for 4 option years.  The service engineers should be sufficiently knowledgeable about the CM120 transmission electron microscope, to be capable of diagnosing and repairing problems.  The CM120, which is a digitally controlled instrument, requires that the engineers be familiar with its software as well as its hardware.  To obtain the high performance that is needed for obtaining high quality data for research, it is essential that a number of complex sub-systems operate together including: (1) the high-precision FEI Compustage, (2) the lens controls, and (3) acceleration voltage controls.  They also need access to factory parts that are needed for repair of problems.  The service engineers must be able to perform installation of electron optical components and electronic components with extreme care and extensive experience.  The operation of the microscope depends critically on the quality of this procedure.  The service agreement should be all inclusive (ex. labor, travel, living expenses, major parts coverage, system software and/or software upgrades applicable to Customer’s current configuration).  Service should be available Monday through Friday, during normal business hours, with a targeted response time of 48 hours.  Coverage should include all parts of the Equipment unless listed specifically.  Services provided will be scheduled maintenance, unscheduled maintenance, telephone support, and replacement parts and components.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 333314 and the Size Standard is 500 employees.  Please be advised of on-line registration requirement in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database http://www.ccr.gov/ and directed spoliation provisions concerning electronic annual On-line Representations and Certifications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>This project is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the act.<br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified acquisition procedures for commercial requirements provided in FAR 13.5. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a separate written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. The solicitation number is RFQ No. NLM-10-029-CYC. This acquisition is not a small business set-aside and the NAICS Code is 541990.
<p>Background<br />In 1999, the NLM Office of High Performance Computing and Communications awarded multiple contracts for the formation of a software development consortium to create and develop an application programmer interface (API) and first implementation of a segmentation and registration toolkit, subsequently named the Insight Toolkit (ITK). The original awards included six contractors: GE Global Research, Insightful, Inc., Kitware, Inc., the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Tennessee. The six contractors were partnered with five subcontractors: Harvard University Medical School, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Pittsburgh, Columbia University, and the University of Utah. The period of performance for the original ITK awards began in 1999 and ended in 2003.<br />The resulting system was originally intended for computer-assisted exploration of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Visible Human (VHP) Male and Female data sets. The final deliverable for this group was an open-source software library concentrating on segmentation and registration algorithms, directly inserted into the public domain that now helps support research worldwide in image analysis and in other domains.<br />Open-source initiatives such as ITK help to lower the barriers to entry in complex research fields by providing the foundations of the software infrastructure necessary to conduct advanced investigations. Revising ITK is considered a contribution to the nation's infrastructure through software. Careful thought has been placed on the cultivation and maintenance of this software, assuring developers that the software will remain supported with new releases, bug fixes, and continuing growth. A maintenance contract, ITK Systems Technologies, was awarded after an open competition in 2004 to Kitware, Inc. The period of performance for the maintenance contract ends September 2009.</p>
<p>Scope of Work<br />The Insight Toolkit (ITK) is currently available with the release, ITK version 3.16, announced in September 2009 (see the URL: http://www.itk.org). Despite continued support through systems technology contracts, NLM wishes to revisit the underlying design and software architecture for ITK at this time. The initial design meeting for ITK was held in early November 1999, and while the design decisions for this software were targeted for the anticipated technology of 2004, those decisions are now showing their age.<br />The purpose of this procurement is to obtain contract development services in support of the Insight Toolkit (ITK), the image processing tools initiative of the Visible Human Project. The goal is to revise ITK to attempt to allow it to perform for the research community for another ten years.<br />All deliverables will be released under the existing ITK license as public, open-source software, and so all deliverables must be free from encumbering licenses or restrictions. The funding for this requirement will be made available under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) and all qualification criteria that arise from the use of ARRA funding apply to this requirement.<br />NLM intends to assemble a team of contractors to address these issues, with the emphasis on experienced ITK programming talent either from a systems development perspective or from the application developer point of view. NLM expects the final team to incorporate between ten (10) to twenty (20) programmers and development staff from among four (4) to eight (8) separate contractors.</p>
<p>Required Tasks<br />The contractor will be required to participate in the following tasks or prepare the following deliverables:<br />1. Attend all contractor meetings (at NIH or some other mutually acceptable designated location). The contract PI is required to attend and may bring such support staff as needed to participate in a technical software engineering and development discussion. These meetings will be held quarterly.<br />2. Participate with the contractor team to meet the goals for ITK. The expected level of participation includes regular attendance at weekly teleconferences, videoconferences, or virtual conferences..<br />3. Develop or modify ITK software in order to accomplish one or more of the following:<br />&bull; Assist with the reorganization and redesign of the ITK software architecture.<br />&bull; Develop or modify ITK software for participation or incorporation with high-performance computing environments<br />&bull; Ease the use of ITK through the establishment of new frameworks, scripting languages or bindings to make ITK more accessible to the non-expert-C++ programmer, or create a revised version of applications that incorporate ITK to accommodate the newly revised and reorganized toolkt.<br />&bull; Execute a DICOM implementation for digital communications in medicine data transfer to and from ITK. ITK requires the use of the most recent DICOM tools or toolkits conforming to the latest releases of the imaging standard. In addition, facilities for the de-identification and anonymization of patient data for collaborative research are essential tools desired for the new revision of ITK. <br />4. Contribute documentation, tutorial materials, and courseware.<br />5. Develop examples of proposed algorithms in ITK or provide renderings of all contributed data.<br />6. Perform all software and documentation development under the style guidelines and architectural rules of the Insight Toolkit.</p>
<p><br />Performance Period<br />The period of performance for these awards is one (1) year. Because of ARRA restrictions this contract may not exceed 2 years and may be terminated with 30 days written notice by the government or the contractor.</p>
<p><br />Reporting/Deliverables<br />All principal investigators are required to attend quarterly design meetings. Oral presentations and progress reports will be requested at those meetings, and electronic copies of slides, handouts, or documentation will serve as quarterly reports. Weekly teleconferences, videoconferences, or virtual conferences will be held to providing continuing communication among the project team. Attendance at these weekly meetings is highly recommended. Deliverables will be checked-in to a source code repository and testing of deliverables will be covered in an automatic build and regression testing environment.<br />All deliverables will reside in the public domain (either through controlled Internet distribution from the NLM or through a third party electronic publisher), including all source code. The NLM will use the Visible Human Project rights and data clause with this requirement, claiming ownership of all data and software generated under this requirement, including all source code. NLM intends to place the ITK license on all software and release it in the public domain. The eventual software developers will be held to high software standards, and extensive documentation for the software tools (including tutorials, manuals, and examples) are required. All deliverables will be checked-in to a source code repository.</p>
<p><br />Proposal Submission<br />Technical Proposals should not exceed fifteen (15) pages, covering:<br />(i) Technical details for:<br />(a) refactoring and improving ITK processes and/or<br />(b) establishing a development direction for ITK support for high performance computing (HPC) and/or<br />(c) developing new techniques for simplifying ITK and/or<br />(d) a more comprehensive approach for support of DICOM standards in ITK,<br />(ii) Qualifications of key personnel to execute a major revision of ITK,<br />(iii) The commitment and experience of the institution or offeror in building and releasing open-source software, especially in working with software under the ITK license or similar unrestricted copyrights.<br />(iv) Proposed relevant facilities<br />Beyond the 15 pages of technical proposal, resumes of key investigators, reprints of relevant technical papers, and other supplemental materials can be provided outside of the page limit. Reviewers are instructed that the 15-page technical proposal is required reading, and supplemental materials are available as part of the support documentation but not required.</p>
<p><br />Evaluation Criteria<br />1. Understanding the Requirement and Technical Approach (scientific, technical, or analytical approach to achieve project objectives, including a demonstrated understanding of potential problems.) -<br />35 Points</p>
<p>The proposal must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirements of the Statement of Work and describes approaches that will demonstrate the achievement of timely and acceptable performance. The proposal must maintain ITK as a software resource that is interoperable across Linux, Windows, and MacOSX computing environments. The proposal should present a comprehensive statement of the problems, scope, and purpose of each subproject to demonstrate an understanding of the requirements from a management and technical standpoint including a perspective of the strengths and needs of ITK and priorities for recreating the toolkit.</p>
<p>The proposal will be evaluated with up to 35 points awarded in the category of "Understanding the Requirement and Technical Approach" for any of the following four (4) criteria (1-4). The MAXIMUM of the scores for the four following sub-criteria will be entered for the score for this section in order to determine whether the proposal is competitive. No penalty will be assessed for a proposal that does not answer all four sub-criteria; that is, an offeror should feel free to focus their effort on one or two areas of their expertise.</p>
<p>In the event that overlapping proposals answering multiple objectives are considered, NLM may choose among the offerors for the most promising combination of approaches to achieve the overall objectives. Offerors may choose to respond to more than one of the following objectives:</p>
<p>(1) The proposal should describe the outlines for a plan to restructure and revise ITK, indicating clearly what elements of ITK could be deprecated and removed, what elements must be kept in a future version of ITK, and how the code could be gainfully improved through reorganization, reimplementation, or other revision (up to 35 points);</p>
<p>AND/OR</p>
<p>(2) The proposal should describe how high performance computing (HPC) elements could be successfully implemented and incorporated into ITK through multi-core/many-core computing, general purpose GPU programming, or cluster/grid/cloud computing. The proposal should delineate how the HPC mechanisms would interact within the current ITK pipeline and how the code would need to be modified to accommodate the HPC elements. If a particular HPC approach is advocated, the proposal should include clear arguments why the approach is recommended over other possible methods. Any such proposal must be interoperable across multiple computing platforms. (up to 35 points);</p>
<p>AND/OR</p>
<p>(3) The proposal should outline an approach for simplifying ITK programming, enabling its use among research teams without expert C++ programmers. Suggestions for lowering the learning curve for ITK that ease its use while maintaining the strength of its versatility and capabilities will be highly valued (up to 35 points);</p>
<p>AND/OR</p>
<p>(4) ITK requires the use of the most recent DICOM tools or toolkits conforming to the latest releases of the imaging standard. In addition, facilities for the de-identification and anonymization of patient data for collaborative research are essential tools desired for the new revision of ITK. The proposal should provide a plan for DICOM support for ITK. The proposal should describe in detail which elements of the DICOM standard will be enabled and which elements would be omitted, justifying the choices as well as describing how the DICOM implementation will interact with the current ITK pipeline. (up to 35 points);</p>
<p>Reviewers will record scores for as many of the four objectives as are stated in the proposal. However, the maximum of the four scores for sub-criteria 1-4 will be entered for this section for the purpose of selecting competitive proposals.</p>
<p>Specifically the proposal must articulate:</p>

<p>2. Qualifications and Availability of Proposed Personnel (demonstrated evidence of the qualifications, experience, and availability of professional and technical personnel comprising the necessary project staff.) 40 Points</p>
<p>The proposal must demonstrate and document the relevant expertise, education, availability, and experience of the proposed personnel to be assigned and available for work under the project. Specifically, the proposal must demonstrate and document:</p>
<p>(a) Background expertise - the extent to which the key personnel and the project team as a whole have access to the range of educational backgrounds in software engineering for revising open source software, especially background experience in programming ITK, a necessary element when considering a revision of the software library and its API.</p>
<p>(b) Experience - the extent to which the key personnel and the project team include significant experience and expertise in the design and implementation of C++ object oriented programming, specifically ITK and its programming approach including the processes and requirements for "extreme programming," cross-platform portability, templated/generic programming, and pipeline software architectures.</p>
<p>Qualifications may include:<br />1) Demonstrated and documented experience with ITK in the form of software contributions, bug fixes, examples, tutorials, testing, or other to ITK.<br />2) Published papers in the Insight Journal<br />3) Documented experience in advanced applications incorporating ITK.<br />4) Other published materials documenting research projects that demonstrate in-depth experience using and programming ITK.</p>
<p>(c) Knowledge of Application Domains - Implementing ITK requires more than just programming expertise, but also knowledge of key scientific or biomedical user domains necessary to meet the objectives of this requirement. Proposals may be evaluated on the extent to which the key personnel and the project team include significant experience and expertise in the specific fields required for the applications area proposed.</p>
<p>Qualifications may include: <br />1) Experience in High Performance Computing for routine volume data analysis, including methods such as: general purpose GPU programming, multi-core/many-core computing, or cluster/grid/cloud computing, especially using C++, with an emphasis on ITK programming.<br />2) Experience in improving user accessibility of complex computing environments, multiple language binding, or technical writing including tutorials, primers, or other user-level documentation.<br />3) Experience in data-intensive image processing fields such as high-resolution 3D microscopy or DICOM programming.</p>
<p>The staffing plan must map named personnel to technical objectives or tasks described in criterion 1 of this technical evaluation plan. To resolve questions of overlapping proposals between contractors, evaluators may be asked to provide separate scores for the staffing plan and qualifications of key personnel for each of the objectives in criterion 1. If reviewers record separate scores for the staffing plans of as many of the four objectives as are stated in the proposal, only the maximum of the four scores for sub-criteria 1-4 will be entered for this section for the purpose of selecting competitive proposals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />3. Institutional Experience/Commitment 15 Points<br />(Commitment to open-source software and open science: a clear understanding and support from the institution that all deliverables will be part of the Insight Toolkit, that all deliverables will be released in the public domain as open source software, that no limitations will be placed on the intellectual property associated with any deliverables, and that the final deliverables will be released under the ITK license)<br />The proposal must demonstrate and document the degree of commitment of the various entities involved in the proposed software development process and the commitment to distributing the product code and related deliverables in source-code form under the ITK license.<br />Support of this experience and commitment should be expressed through (a) documentation of previous releases of ITK software, (b) a letter of support from the offeror's Dean or Chief Operating Officer or similar official stating the offeror's commitment to releasing patent privileges and copyrights of work performed under this requirement to the public domain, and/or (c) the text of the copyright or license, documented or clearly cited for its source, used by the offeror in previous releases of open source software and/or public domain data.</p>
<p>4. Proposed Facilities and Equipment (availability and proposed utilization.) 10 Points<br />The contractor should have a demonstrated ongoing active research interest and an in-house program in clinical or biomedical information processing or the use of medical computing in health services research. This requirement is necessary to ensure the contractor has the established background and knowledge required to make practical advances in these complex areas of research. NLM wishes to establish relationships with institutions or organizations that have independent/complementary research interests to ensure continued development towards the eventual goal of comprehensive algorithm coverage in ITK. <br />The contractor should also have access to members of the principal user groups for which ITK is intended (i.e., computer software designers and toolbuilders for health sciences practitioners, educators, health services researchers, biomedical researchers) who can be used to test the effectiveness of the structures and models developed.<br />The proposal must describe the availability and proposed utilization of appropriate facilities and equipment required to successfully perform work in the proposed application area. This includes access to source data and validation instrumentation.<br />5. Past Performance<br />Past performance - a past performance evaluation will be performed as part of the review (by the Project Officer/Contracting Officer's Technical Representative, NOT by the technical evaluation committee, so no points are indicated in the technical evaluation). The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror as well as other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the government.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Past Performance should include previous experience with Grants and other assistance vehicles as well as with previous contracts. Grants and contracts arising from other agencies such as DARPA and NSF will likely be part of the histories and should be evaluated without prejudice.</p>
<p><br />American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) Unique Reporting Requirements:</p>
<p>FAR Clause 52.204-11, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act--Reporting Requirements (March 2009)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>Contract, as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16.</p>
<p>First-tier subcontract means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act.</p>
<p>Jobs created means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter.</p>
<p>Jobs retained means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter.</p>
<p>Total compensation means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractor's past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)):</p>
<p>(1) Salary and bonus.<br />(2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Shared Based Payments.<br />(3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees.<br />(4) Change in pension value.

For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000.</p>
<p>(b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this contract. These reports will be made available to the public.</p>
<p>(c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at http://www.FederalReporting.gov.</p>
<p>(1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable.<br />(2) The amount of Recovery Act funds invoiced by the contractor for the reporting period.

This covers the contract (or portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act.<br />(7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractor's workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide-</p>
<p>(i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Team Leader manages DCHA/OTI's Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Team within the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Chief, FPD or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has three regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Asia and Middle East (AME), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Team Leader's principal responsibility will be the oversight and management of DCHA/OTI country programs in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) geographic region. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus the vast majority of time on country program implementation. The objectives for this position are to (1) ensure USAID/DCHA/OTI's regional team is managed effectively in Washington and the field (effectively manage and supervise OTI Program Manager staff in Washington, and OTI Country Representatives in the field), and (2) ensure US government funds are spent wisely, in coordination with other key actors, and in a manner that reflects OTI standard practice, and USG policy.</p>
<p><br />9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The incumbent serves as OTI's principal expert on country program issues related to the region of assignment. A majority of the duties listed below are related to management and supervision of program funded personal, and the development, oversight, and management of OTI's country programs. It is important that the Team Leader quickly familiarize her/himself in the key tasks of the country team members in order to ensure that primary tasks are carried out appropriately and efficiently.</p>
<p>The Team Leader's duties will include but not be limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Lead and manage the Regional Team in Washington headquarters, including the management and supervision of Program Manager staff in Washington and Country Representatives in the field, as well as Implementing Partner grants and agreements at the headquarter level. (Note that OTI Country Representatives in the field directly supervise additional field staff, and responsibility for managing implementing partners at the headquarter level may be delegated to trained Program Manager staff in Washington.);</p>
<p>&bull; Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives, ensure staff work objectives and tasks are well defined, and ensure recruitment is initiated immediately when staffing needs arise. Ensure staff are highly qualified and trained and mentored in all critical aspects of OTI operations and programming. Ensure employee performance evaluations are completed in a timely manner in accordance with OTI office policy;</p>
<p>&bull; Negotiate, oversee and manage the overall Regional Team country budgets and ensure the Regional Team procurement plan is kept up to date. It is critical to ensure that country programs are appropriately budgeted for. Additional responsibilities include working to secure additional funding from other USG sources if required, and ensuring that the team is trained on all the appropriate systems and tools for budgeting, finances and procurement;</p>
<p>&bull; Conceptualize and design, in close coordination with lower and higher-ranking USAID and other U.S. Government officials, OTI country program strategies and determine appropriate USAID funding levels and requirements;</p>
<p>&bull; Oversee the design and implementation of new country program operations to include complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies in high priority countries, including the effective oversight of management, logistical, budget, administrative, human resources, and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull; Supervise the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives, including overseeing and/or managing the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and Personal Service Contract employees;</p>
<p>&bull; Oversee and ensure the development of documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with NGOs, international donors, Department of State and other USG agencies and others interested in particular OTI country programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate and communicate with other DCHA, USAID, State Department, Department of Defense and other U.S. Government agency personnel in Washington and the field; cooperating country Government officials; United Nations organizations; the World Bank; and host country and international NGOs;</p>
<p>&bull; Monitor and evaluate OTI country programs through regular communication with the OTI program staff and implementing partner headquarter staff, the regular review of reports from the field and Washington, liaising with the OTI Program Office team, and regular field site visits;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that field programs are provided support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; Oversee, develop and/or manage, in conjunction with the OTI Washington staff and OTI country representative in the field, an OTI close-out strategy that will, wherever appropriate and possible, ensure reasonable and effective hand-over to follow-on USAID and/or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as a central participant on inter- and intra-agency policy and crisis task forces when required;</p>
<p>&bull; Disseminate regular DCHA/OTI reports to U.S. Government and non-U.S. Government agencies and organizations as deemed appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting Chief of Field Programs Division, or Country Representative in the field in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, stand in as Team Leader for other regions;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor other OTI Team Leaders, and mentor and train Country Representatives and Program Managers as required;</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Team Leader will take direction from and will report to the Chief, Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on assessment teams, Country Start-Ups, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Assessments, Country Start-ups, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>
<p>12. START DATE: Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.</p>
<p>13. POINT OF CONTACT: See Cover Letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />EDUCATION/EXPERIENCE REQUIRED FOR THIS POSITION</p>
<p>(Determines basic eligibility for the position. Applicants who do not meet all of education and experience factors are considered NOT qualified for the position. See detailed instructions for demonstrating Education/Experience under "Applying")</p>
<p>The Team Leader must be an individual with sound judgment, excellent communication, interpersonal and analytical skills and possess a well-developed understanding of US policy interests. The successful candidate must have a strong interest in assisting countries in transition and be able to accomplish a wide range of assignments on short notice.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>BASIS OF AWARD</p>
<p>1) Award will be based on the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable meaning award will be made to the lowest evaluated price quotation meeting or exceeding the acceptability of standards for non-cost factors.</p>
<p>2) Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, including any option prices if applicable. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in Section B by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) to confirm the extended amount for each. The extended amounts will be added together to determine the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>After the cursory review is performed, the government will start evaluation with the lowest price offeror, to determine technical acceptability using the submittals in section 4 of the PWS. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to be technically acceptable and is determined to be responsible, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offeror. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to be technically acceptable, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will1) continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to be technically acceptable or until all offerors are evaluated. The Contracting Officer shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>Price<br />Technical Approach</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of provision)<br />In addition, the proposal must list the Company name, address, DUNS number, CAGE code, Federal TIN, and point of contact to include phone number and email address.

<DESC><br />Question and Answer Board<br />Bid closes 12/18/2009
<p>1. Q - Does the rolling roof need to span the entire distance of the top, or will the opening simply nee to be large enough for someone to enter safely for cleanout and such? We have the option of a low-profile prefabricated, retractable covers that we can use. These particular covers can only cover approximately 60" wide x 72" per cover.</p>
<p>A - Yes the rolling roof needs to extend over the entire top. In the summer it is too hot to have anyone inside a closed bin to clean it. In the winter the water freezes and it would be impossible to <br />clean if closed.</p>
<p>2. Q - Do you want us to engineer the sludge bins? to include the hookup and drain process?</p>
<p>A - No, engineering is not necessary. We have most of the parts and we have a certified welder on staff who has modified the one we have for our exact needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Q - Do you have a current diagram/specs. or blue print?</p>
<p>A - No I do not have blue prints, but we do have pictures (attached) if that would help. be advised that the pictures are of the bin we have modified and sprayed with the insulation required.</p>
<p><br />4. Q - Material preference?</p>
<p>A - Material of the bins is steel.</p>

<CONTACT>Allison Griffin, 508-233-4495

<a href="mailto:allison.griffin@us.army.mil">RDECOM Natick Contracting Center ICP (RDECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>The US Army Research Development Engineering Command, Natick Soldier Center, is conducting a market survey for technical information on concepts for High Altitude Oxygen Breathing Systems.  Military Free Fall parachutists and aircrews need supplemental oxygen during the performance of the Ram Air parachute operations as well as during unpressurized flights.<BR>The following briefly describe the Oxygen requirements:<BR>" All personnel will pre-breathe 100 percent aviation grade oxygen at or below 10,000 feet MSL pressure or cabin altitude below 10,000 feet MSL pressure on any mission scheduled for a drop at or above 18,000 feet MSL.<BR>" The required pre-breathing time will be completed before the 20-minute warning and before the cabin altitude ascends through 10,000 feet MSL.<BR>" Any break in pre-breathing requires restarting the pre-breathing period or removing the individuals whose pre-breathing was interrupted from the mission.<BR>" Pre-breathing requires the presence of an Air Force physiological technician onboard the aircraft.<BR>" All personnel onboard during unpressurized operations above 10,000 feet MSL and higher will use oxygen. (Exception: Parachutists may operate without supplemental oxygen during unpressurized flights up to 13,000 feet MSL provided the time above 10,000 feet MSL does not exceed 30 minutes each sortie.)<BR>The bailout systems require a duration of oxygen lasting from the time when the parachutist disconnects from the Pre-breathe console, until he descends to an altitude below 10,000 ft MSL at a minimum. Improved Ram Air Canopy systems, in particular when used in High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) insertion operations, have extended and continue to extend the parachutists time aloft.  Future insertion operations could exceed 45 minutes from exit to ground.  Additional race tracks and physical activities within the aircraft can cause jumpers to consume the oxygen volume needed for the descent prior to exit.<BR>Current Pre-breathe consoles are connected to the parachutists bailout system and are designed to supply the parachutist with 100% oxygen without depleting the bailout cylinders.  These consoles are designed to support the pre-breathe requirements of up to 8 parachutists, but in many cases the internal volume of the oxygen supply is inadequate to fully support this mission.  As a result, the consoles are downgraded to support no more than 6 parachutists, and in some cases additional consoles and or large K bottles are installed on the aircraft to support pre-breathing needs and additional racetracks. This equipment is organic to the inserting unit, is left on board the aircraft and needs to be recovered after operations.  In training, this means landing, off loading, and takeoff prior to the next assignment; possibly wasting fuel and time.  Operationally, this is not possible as the aircraft needs to egress in a manner as not to compromise the inserting units mission.  Equipment recovery in this case becomes difficult.<BR>The Military Free Fall community has interest in an Oxygen breathing system that has the duration to support both an individual parachutists pre-breathing and bailout requirements.  This duration should be not less than 2.5 hours threshold and an objective of 4 hours.<BR>Successful development could lead to additional uses for aircrews desiring the freedom to move about the back of the aircraft without an oxygen hose tethering them and restricting their movements.  Other applications may be an emergency egress breathing system (non-fire related), and possibly a smaller more efficient subsurface re-breather for military or commercial use.<BR>Considerations for design:<BR>* The system must be safe for use. <BR>* Must be able to integrate with all existing MFF parachute system to include tandem systems (tandem master and passenger) and tethered bundle systems and not interfere with equipment mountings. Must be compatible with current and future helmet systems to include Gentex, ACH, and Protec, Must not interfere with Navigation systems mounting or readability, Night Vision devices, or Heads Up Displays<BR>* System<BR>o Duration should be not less than 3 hours Threshold and an objective of 4.5 hours.<BR>o Unit size should be as small as possible.<BR>o Gauge should be oriented and large enough to be easily read with or without Night vision devices. <BR>o Shall operate at temperatures ranging from -65 degrees F to 160 degrees F and humidity ranging from zero to 100 %, non-condensing.<BR>o Shall demonstrate a functional reliability of 95% (T) to 99% (O) at a 90% confidence level.<BR>o Must provide a procedure to verify functionality during pre jump and Jumpmaster Personnel Inspection (JMPI) to include tank pressure, leaks, and gas valve flow direction and functionality.<BR>o Frost or ice accumulation outside the bail out oxygen storage subsystem, manifold, hose and regulator, or inside or outside the mask shall not preclude proper operation of the system. <BR>o The breathing mask shall incorporate a communication capability consistant with current communications systems.<BR>o Shall incorporate self-sealing connections and non-crushable hoses where applicable.<BR>o The breathing mask shall be a low-profile mask, attached to the parachutists helmet by a secure mask suspension system that must be capable of withstanding opening shocks up to 15Gs.  During movement on board the aircraft, exit, high-speed free-fall, parachute opening, descent and landing, the mask is to remain securely on the parachutists face.<BR>o Pressurized oxygen storage systems shall be shatterproof, rated at maximum working pressure of not more than 3000 psig and shall meet all applicable Department of Transportation (DOT) certification requirements and Department of Defense (DOD) transport aircraft flight clearance requirements. <BR><BR>Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government. All interested firms, regardless of size are encouraged to respond to this request for information. It should be noted that this is a market survey and not a pre-solicitation notice.

We appreciate if you could expand on your meaning of "Transfer multiple levels of related objects" and "Provide multi-level authorizations and support for user roles allowing different levels of access for users in the organization and providing the capability for administrators to restrict the number of objects and the number of parallel processes you can use during a single copy"
A2.  "Transfer multiple levels of related objects" is
The software needs to provide the capability to move data consistently per how the SAP instance has been configured (see attached landscape diagram), ensuring the transfer of all data and maintaining all links to related data objects.  Thus it must be able to move all Invoices, Master data, customer records, etc. related to particular purchase orders, in order for the Purchase Orders to function in the target system.
"Provide multi-level authorizations and support for user roles allowing different levels of access for users in the organization and providing the capability for administrators to restrict the number of objects and the number of parallel processes you can use during a single copy" 
The software must provide the capability for the Client Copy tool administrator (Basis/Security team) via multi-level authorizations and user role to restrict how the client Copy tool users can copy back data from the source system to the target clients. 
Q3.  Does DOI anticipate any potential conflicts of interest between the work described in this RFI and future DOI SAP implementation or O&M (operate & maintain) procurements?
A3.   NO, this is a single procurement and implementation of a turn-key software solution. The current O&M team will have operate and maintain responsibilities for the client copy solution once this software is installed and integrated by the software vendor.
Q4.  If a company has a FMLOB support contract with DOI NBC does that create any potential conflict of interest with the work described in this RFI?
A4.  Based on additional information provided and discussions with the FMLOB Contracting Officer, this does not appear to create a potential conflict of interest. 
Q5.  Does the response to the RFI have to propose a bill of materials for one specific tool set? Or can a company include in our RFI response descriptions of different tool set options which the company has had experience with or has knowledge of?
A5. The RFI is to identify sources that may be capable of meeting the Government's needs.  The software vendor is to provide a Capability Statement of the software identified within the RFI.  Present and future capabilities, technical solutions, and an implementation time-line will be differentiation criteria for the procurement.
A software vendor may include descriptions of different tool set options which the company has had experience with or has knowledge of, as long as, it meets the identified governmental needs stated within the RFI.  (Also see responses to questions 7 - 16)
Q6.  Several requirements mention establishing a shell client in the Source System and populating this client with configuration, master data and transaction data. Best Practices would normally dictate that no client or changes should be made in the Source system, particularly if the source system is the Production instance. Does DOI specifically requirethat the shell client be created in the Source system rather than the target system?
A6.   No, the shell client is to be created in the target system (see RFI 18141, Amendment 1) 
Q7.  Is the scope of the request limited to the ECC 6.0 Financial System? Or is DOI looking for a tool set that meets the requirements also for BI, BI PBF or even PRISM?
A7.  The tools set must work with SAP ECC and SAP BI at this time.   It's not intended to be used for non-sap applications.
Q8.  What is the current SAP version? 
A8.  SAP ECC V6.0
Q9.  What is the current CRM version? 
A9.  DOI does not have CRM
Q10.  What is the database size? 
A10.   R/3 is about 1.2TB and BW 2.6TB
Q11.  What is the current SAP BASIS support team size?
A11.  It is currently 6 FTEs
Q12.  Frequency of system refreshes? 
A12.  It will depend on Business need but will be at least 6 times per year for full client builds then as needed per Break-Fix testing needs into QAS1 (quality assurance).
Q13.  Number of master data objects that need to be scrambled? e.g. 1=MARA, 2=VBAK etc
A13.    DOI has implemented SAP to support financials and requires that all PII (Personally Identifiable Information) in Vendor Master, Customer Master, Charge Card and Labor processing such as Duns, TIN, SSN, charge card number, Account numbers, etc be scrabbled when the data is transferred from PROD (production) back to Dev (development) and QAS/Test Environment (quality assurance).   DOI has less than 24 objects.
Q14.  Size of master data records in ECC PRD and CRM system? e.g. MARA = 1GB, VBAK = 500MB 
A14.   VBAK = 4580 rows; MARA = 1row
Q15.  Are CRM, BI, SCM systems in scope? 
A15.  BI is in scope. 
Q16.  Can you please share your landscape diagram?  
A16.   We have the traditional 5 Box landscape of Dev2 and QAS2 for Deployment Next and Dev1 and QAS1 for current Production break/fix into PROD.  In addition we have a Training Env.   (per request a diagram may be sent via email)

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, 800 Centennial Avenue, Piscataway, NY 08854-3911 for a service agreement for the AKTA Purifier10.  The period of performance is for a year with the potential for two option years.  The Dynamics of Macromolecular Assembly group is conducting collaborative research in the characterization of the thermodynamic and dynamic aspects of proteins and protein interactions.  One of the major tools applied in the research is the AKTA Purifier10.  The AKTA Purifier10 is a chromatography system used to purify and separate proteins from buffer contaminants and from other protein in solutions.  After samples are run through the AKTA Purifier10, it is insured that the protein under study is a pure product and at its most optimum condition.  It is essential to the research to maintain the AKTA Purifier10 in the best possible working condition.  Routine maintenance is performed to keep the AKTA clean and running well, however, many calibrations and repairs require a qualified expert.  The maintenance contract covers unlimited repairs, travel, parts, labor, and includes one Preventive Maintenance visit per year.  The Preventive Maintenance visit saves valuable time and money as it trouble shoots many possible problems which could occur.  In addition, service technicians have been prompt, helpful, and extremely qualified when called for repairs.  GE Healthcare is the sole provider of this service contract and only GE Healthcare Field Service Engineers are qualified to work on this equipment and their software.  This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 811219 and the Size Standard is $7.0M.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-EB-2010-38-JKS may be submitted by mail to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6136A, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Jennifer Schlegel, by fax transmission to (301) 480-3432 or by email to schlegeljk@nhlbi.nih.gov

<DESC><strong>AMENDED SYNOPSIS (FEDBIZOPPS Notice) - Posted 11 December 2009<br /></strong><br /><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a formal acknowledgement that additional changes are forthcoming to RFP-BARDA-09-35.&nbsp; This RFP remains a Small Business Set-Aside in accordance with FAR 19.5.&nbsp; The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) continue to seek medical countermeasures (MCMs) that will support an effective public health emergency response to smallpox.&nbsp; There will be two significant changes made to the RFP.&nbsp; First, under Section L.5. (Type of Contract and Number of Awards), the United States Government (USG) now contemplates <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one or more awards</span> of a five-year hybrid Firm Fixed Price/Cost Reimbursable type contract for MCMs that can provide treatment for individuals exposed to smallpox.&nbsp; Second, under Section M.1. (Mandatory Criteria for Eligibility), although the Offeror will still need to provide evidence for therapeutic index in non-human primate model under an eventual contract, the USG is willing to forego this mandatory criterion for eligibility at this time.&nbsp; All other mandatory criteria for eligibility will remain unchanged.&nbsp; <br /><br />It remains imperative that an Offeror(s) responding to this amended RFP seek guidance from the FDA prior to submission of&nbsp;a proposal(s) so the proposal may be aligned with current FDA policy, practices, guidance, and current thinking.<br /><br />All amended details and requirements will be described in the forthcoming amendment to the Smallpox Antiviral solicitation, <strong>RFP-BARDA-09-35</strong>.&nbsp; This amendment will be made available electronically through <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a>&nbsp;on or about <strong>28 December 2009</strong>.&nbsp; Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal to be considered by the USG.&nbsp; This amended notice does not commit the USG to the award of a contract(s).&nbsp; Only written or email requests will be accepted directly from the requestor for the solicitation.&nbsp; No collect calls will be accepted.&nbsp; No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.&nbsp; All responses should be identified with the solicitation number <strong>RFP-BARDA-09-35</strong>, name of company, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address of Point of Contact (POC), should be submitted to the Contracting Officer identified in this notice.&nbsp; <br />

<DESC><p><strong>Modification to a Previous Notice<br /></strong><br />Potential offerors, and other interested parties, are hereby notified that the approximate date the Department of Defense (DoD), TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) intends to issue a solicitation (RFP) for a follow-on contract for the TRICARE Dental Program (TDP), currently performed by United Concordia Companies, Inc. (H94002-05-D-0001) is changed to December 21, 2009.</p>
<p><strong>Please ignore the Response Dates (Original and Current) shown for this Pre-Solicitation Notice. When TMA issues the solicitation (RFP), on or about December 21, 2009, a notice will be posted and TMA will allow at least 45 days for offerors to prepare/submit their proposal in response to the RFP.</strong></p>
<p>The TDP provides for a voluntary, premium based indemnity dental insurance coverage plan that is available to specified categories of individuals who are qualified for these benefits by virtue of their relationship to one of the seven Uniformed Services (i.e., Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the USPHS (U.S. Public Health Service) and NOAA (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration)).</p>
<p>The RFP identifies those TDP dental insurance benefits and administrative services required by the Government. These required administrative services include, but are not limited to, underwriting, marketing, eligibility verification and enrollment, premium collection, provider credentialing, development and maintenance of a preferred provider network in specified geographic areas, claim adjudication and payment, customer services, and the processing of appeals and grievances.</p>
<p>The RFP includes four changes to the current TDP program benefits. The benefit changes are: 1) coverage of 1-3 surface posterior resin fillings (white fillings), 2) increasing the current annual maximum from $1,200 to $1,300, 3) increasing the current lifetime orthodontic maximum from $1,500 to $1,750, and 4) the initiation of dental accident coverage with a yearly maximum of $1,200.</p>
<p>The period of performance under this contract is anticipated to be six years. The contract will be comprised of an anticipated twelve month transition/phase-in period (August 1, 2010 - July 31, 2011), followed by five one-year option periods (August 1 through July 31) for the performance of TDP dental services.</p>
<p>During the evaluation process of this procurement, all option periods will be evaluated for purposes of determining a fair and reasonable price. All interested sources capable of performing this service will be considered. The Government contemplates award of a fixed-price contract resulting from the solicitation.</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 will be used for this acquisition. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered for award. The requirement is unrestricted.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.102 (a) (1), the solicitation will be made available electronically on the TMA contracting website. To obtain a copy of the TDP Request for Proposal (RFP), RFP H94002-09-R-0001; go to the TMA solicitation website http://www.tricare.osd.mil/contracting/healthcare/solicitations/ and scroll down to Dental Services and click on H94002-10-R-0001. Paper copies of the solicitation will not be provided by the Government. To access the solicitation, go to the above website. If you wish to receive information regarding the request for proposal during the solicitation process, you may register as a potential offeror on the TMA website. Questions regarding this procurement must be submitted using the *E-Mail Questions to the Contracting Officer* option on the TRICARE website.</p>
<p>TMA does not currently intend to hold a pre-proposal conference; however, should TMA decide to hold one, those potential offerors who have registered on the TMA website will be notified.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this notice should be directed to the Contracting Officer in writing or via email. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY 2009 SIMULUS PROJECT

Pre-Solicitation Notice:

The General Services Administration (GSA), Northeast and Caribbean Region is seeking qualified General Contractors (GC) interested in providing construction services for a Federal Parking Garage. 

The project must conform to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings) and Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS) and allow for the achievement of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) credits, so that the project in its entirety can be considered for future LEED ratings.

The GC services of a new Federal Parking Garage to be located in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The building will be located at 150 Carlos E. Chardon Street which is on an existing 27 acre federal campus located in the Hato Rey area of San Juan. This procurement is for the selection of a qualified GC. The selected GC will provide construction and landscaping services for this new federal Parking Garage that will be approximately 16,000 square meters (172,223 sf) and that will house 500 parking spaces and will be 3.5 stories high. The Garage will be constructed with concrete columns and slabs supported by concrete spread footing foundations. Construction elements include but are not limited to steel stairs, fire protection, photo-voltaic system, lighting, electrical and two hydraulic elevators.

 The site in which the Federal Garage will be situated is on approximately 6 acres of land and will involve new site roadways, walkways, site lighting and landscaping. A new entrance to the site will be created to line up with Hostos Avenue at Chardon Avenue. Upon aligning of the roads, traffic control systems, pavement striping, bollards, concrete barriers and signage will be required.  

The offeror selected shall be required to supply all labor, materials, equipment and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract. 

The Estimated Construction Cost Range for this project is between $15,000,000 and $25,000,000.  Funding for the design of this project was requested as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 (recovery.gov).  A portion of this funding was used by the General Services Administration to procure the services of an A/E firm to create a master plan for the site and design of this parking garage.

This procurement will be negotiated utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection Procedures using the Best Value/ Trade-off process.  For this procurement the evaluation factors, when combined, will be equal to price.  The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR Part 16.202); based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the contractor that offers the best value to the Government.  


The Request for Proposals (RFP) is scheduled to be issued on or about January 4, 2010, via FedBizOpps (https://www.fbo.gov/).  The technical factors for the RFP are tentatively as follows: (#1) Experience and Past Performance on Similar Projects; and (#2) Qualifications of Key Personnel. 

Upon receipt of the narrative responses, the Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) will evaluate each submission.  The TEB will reach a consensus rating for each firm.  The firms will be ranked in order of preference based on their final ratings. After the firms have been ranked, an evaluation will be made of the price proposals from the offerors who meet the minimum technical criteria. 

Discussions with offerors may be necessary.  The Government reserves the right to award without conducting negotiations. 

This procurement is open to small and large business concerns. Before award of the contract, the business concern (if not a small business concern), shall be required to present an acceptable, proactive subcontracting plan, pursuant to FAR Part 19.7. GSA’s Socio-Economic Program goals are below, but contractors should develop their own goals with these in mind: Small Business (37%), Small Disadvantaged Business (6%), Small Woman-Owned Business (5%), HUBZone Business (3%), Veteran-Owned (5%), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business (3%). Failure to submit and/or comply with the minimum requirements of the subcontracting plan will render the offeror unacceptable. All questions and clarifications regarding the project documents shall be put in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer. Production costs and proposal preparation costs are at the expense of the offeror. 

A Site Visit / Pre-Proposal Conference will be held for this procurement. The date and time will be posted on the FedBizOpps (estimated date is on January 20, 2010). The purpose of the conference will be to discuss the projects and address any questions or concerns and to provide offerors the opportunity to visit the site.

All correspondence in response to this announcement must be clearly indicate the Solicitation No. GS-02P-10-DT-C-0005.  This project is being funded by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act 2009.  Reporting Requirements from the contractor are mandated per the Act.   

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.

<DESC>*****************<br /><br />AMENDMENT 9: <br /><br />The purpose of Amendment 9 to HSTS04-09-R-ST2180 is to notify potential Offerors of the Government's intent to execute a data collection effort for the upcoming Checked Baggage Inspection Systems (CBIS) procurement.<br /><br />In order to establish a Qualification Product List (QPL) for the upcoming CBIS procurement, TSA intends to use equipment certification readiness testing (CRT) data to evaluate the qualification data package (QDP). The QDP will be a requirement under the CBIS Request for Proposal and will be used to evaluate Offerors' ability to proceed to certification testing, which will be criteria for CBIS&nbsp;QPL and Indefinite-Deliver-Indefinite-Quantity contract award. TSA intends to use CRT data for equipment under various categories,<br /><br /><br />1) CRT data for TSA certified equipment without any configuration changes. Equipment under this category does not require re-testing for CRT and TSA will use existing CRT data to evaluate QDP for CBIS.
<p><br />2) CRT data for TSA certified equipment with configuration changes. Data previously collected under this equipment category will not be utilized for QDP evaluation due to configuration changes after the initial certification. Equipment under this category is required to undergo the CRT process again in order to collect new CRT data for purposes of evaluating the QDP for CBIS.</p>
<p><br />3) CRT data for new systems never certified by TSA. Equipment under this category is required to undergo the CRT process just like certified equipment with configuration changes.<br /><br />Data collection for equipment that falls under category 2 and 3 above will begin on January 15, 2010. Potential Offerors' that wish to participate in the CRT data collection, for any equipment that falls under categories 2 and 3, will be fully responsible for shipping, installation, and decommissioning of equipment proposed to be included in data collection. These activities must be completed by January 15, 2010. Note that TSA or vendor owned equipment currently located at the TSL is eligible for use for CRT data collection purposes; however, Offerors that wish to use TSA-owned equipment will be solely responsible for configuration changes expenses before and after testing.<br /><br />After data collection for equipment under 2 and 3 above is complete, TSA will share all system specific data simultaneously with the respective original equipment manufacturers. This includes data for equipment that falls under any of the equipment categories listed above. This data will be shared with all participating vendors on or about February 1, 2010.<br /><br />Any vendor interesting in participating in this data collection or to verify that the Government has sufficient data to evaluate the QDP for CBIS procurement, must contact the Office of Acquisition within 7 calendar days of this announcement. Any inquiries must be submitted to HSTS04ebsp@dhs.gov.</p>
<p>NOTE: Vendors planning to participate in the upcoming CBIS procurement will need this data in order to properly prepare a complete QDP package.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY—THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.   THIS NOTICE IS NOT A NOTICE FOR SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.  THE ACTION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT, DOLJ09UA00027.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR IDENTIFIED BELOW.

This opportunity was available only to the Del-Jen, Inc under contract number DOLJ09UA00027.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps intends to award a modification in the amount of $112,909 to the Mississippi Job Corps Center, operated by Del-Jen, Inc.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceiling for Equipment on this contract.

It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).

The funding is intended to address the following program initiatives:  1) CTT auto and construction curriculum; 2) Green Equipment Projects at the Mississippi Job Corps Center; and 3) to be directed to electric and electric hybrid vehicles for operation on Job Corps centers. These funds may be used for all expenses related to the acquisition of electric vehicles, including purchase of vehicles, shipping and delivery costs, training on use of vehicle, and additional equipment such as batteries and supplies. In addition, Job Corps centers with automotive career technical training (CTT) programs will use this opportunity to acquire electric hybrid vehicles as student training aids, to provide hands-on technical training in “green” vehicle technologies. 

This Modification has been awarded on December 10, 2009.

Part 1 – Background Information and Description of Acquisition

1.	Program Office

NIH/NCI/CCR/DBS/LP
Dr. Stephen Hewitt
		Advanced Technology Center (ATC)
Room 212A
		Gaithersburg, MD 20877-4117
301-402-0040

2.	Product Title/Proposed Contractor

Maintenance Agreement for Government-owned Becton Dickinson Pathway 855, s/n 1001-87892-7321

BD Biosciences (Becton Dickinson & Company)
2350 Qume Drive
San Jose, CA 95131-1807

3.	Purpose/Brief History

a.	Overall Program

Currently, the ATC Building houses the BD Biosciences Pathway 855 Imaging System (s/n 1001-87892-7321) and needs maintenance. The instrument is in use daily by laboratory personnel to perform scientific research towards the mission of the NCI. This instrument is used heavily and is considered an essential part in daily studies. For these reasons, it is imperative that a maintenance agreement be enacted in order to keep the machine running proficiently and for immediate access to all service bulletins that occur as time passes.

b.	Project With Which the JOFOC is Associated


The purpose of this requirement is associated specifically with the need for a maintenance contract for the BD Biosciences Pathway 855 Imaging System. Since BD is the manufacturer of the instrument, the maintenance is necessary from the same vendor to ensure optimal use and guarantee that efficiently trained technicians perform any service that may be needed.

4.  Government’s Cost Estimate: $32,963.92


 Previous/Future Plans:

The service contract may be renewed in the future, but no plans are available at this time.

Part II – Facts and Reasons to Justify Other Than Full and Open Competition

1		Statute:  This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41   U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers   may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  

No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.  

2	     Justification:
		
		It is critical to the research community currently using the instrument that all service be performed by the same vendor that manufactured and implemented the equipment in the lab. It is imperative that the system is calibrated accurately and maintained according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Any deviation from the specifications could run distort information or disrupt studies currently in process on the instrument. Technicians to be provided from the vendor are factory trained, have access to technical manuals relating specifically to the system including recall notices. In addition, proprietary software and replacement parts are available only through BD Biosciences to supply and service their instruments. Specifically, the Pathway 855 system is equipped with a series of lasers which must be aligned, calibrated and replaced properly to ensure the results are accurate for the studies being performed on the equipment. 

		Finally, BD Biosciences is the only company that stocks or has access to the specific parts needed to maintain the function of the system and offer proprietary software upgrades as well. For these reasons, no other source is known to the NCI capable of providing the service on the BD Biosciences Pathway 855 Imaging System currently in use in the lab.


3	The proposed contract action was publicized in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) and procured as a Simplified Acquisition purchase as authorized in FAR 13.106 and 13.5.    
   
4	Market Research: Since this service is not available from any other source due to proprietary software and replacement parts, no market research was completed. In addition, this contract action was published in the Federal Business Opportunities and closed on November 19, 2009 with no capability statements received. This shall help to re-affirm the vendor as a sole source for the proposed maintenance contract.

5.   	N/A 

6.   	In the event NCI requires additional services the proposed requirement will be synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunities, if exceeding the simplified threshold.  An award will only be made, if during negotiations

2.  Nature and Description of Action Being Approved:
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission intends to award a sole source requirement for an application fee for the Certificate of Excellence in Accountability Reporting (CEAR) to Association of Government Accounting, 2208 Mount Vernon Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22301.  This is a new contract action.

3.  Description of the supplies or services required to meet the needs of the SEC and the estimated value:  
The requirement is to obtain the Association of Government Accounting’s evaluation of the Commission’s Performance and Accountability Report.  The related documents and filing fee are due to the Association of Government Accounting within 30 days after the Commission’s Performance and Accountability Report is due to OMB and Congress.  

The estimated purchase order value is $5,000.00, which will use FY10 funds.   

4.  Statutory Authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition:
	The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2) - Only one responsible source.

5.  Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:
The Certificate of Excellence in Accountability Reporting (CEAR) Program has been helping federal agencies produce high-quality Performance and Accountability Reports since 1997. The program was established in conjunction with the federal Chief Financial Officers Council and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to improve financial and program accountability by streamlining reporting and improving the effectiveness of such reports.  The AGA advises agencies on how to prepare integrated and user-friendly Performance and Accountability Reports that clearly show what an agency accomplished with taxpayer dollars and the challenges that remain. 

The AGA is the only entity able to fill this requirement as it conducts its reviews and recommendations for improvements in the Commission’s performance reporting practices.

The AGA serves government accountability professionals by providing quality education, fostering professional development and certification, and supporting standards and research to advance government accountability.
	
6.  Efforts to ensure that offers are solicited from as Many Potential Sources as Possible.
There are no efforts being made to solicit offers from sources other than AGA for the current requirement.  AGA is the only association involved in federal agency financial performance reporting that provides evaluation results, detailed technical comments, and recommendations for improvement in agency federal financial reporting.  The requirement was transmitted to GPE on [12/11/2009] and, if warranted by the response to such notice, this action will be reviewed.

7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. 
	Before awarding a contract, the Contracting Officer will perform a price analysis in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b) (and a cost analysis, if required) to determine whether the price is fair and reasonable.

8.  Description of market research conducted and results or statement of the reasons market research was not conducted:
In the field of federal agency Performance and Accountability Reports, the AGA is the only vendor capable of meeting the requirement.

9.  Other Supporting Facts: 
None

10.  A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing an interest in the acquisition:
	A list of sources that express an interest in actions under this J&A will be maintained in the applicable contract files.

11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:
	The Commission’s information requirements are ongoing and future acquisitions of similar services will be advertised.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSJustification and ApprovalForOther Than Full and Open Competition1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, Alaska VA Healthcare System.2.	Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the emergency services to repair a cracked boiler that provides hot water for heating a Domiciliary in Anchorage, Alaska.  There are two boilers, but during the winter months, it takes both to meet the heating demand. The service repair will be conducted with:Pinnacle Mechanical Inc5821 Arctic Blvd, Unit DAnchorage, AK 99518-1636(907) 336-43283.	Description of Supplies or Services:  Emergency boiler repair is needed to ensure that patients (and staff) at the Homeless Veterans Domiciliary has sufficient heating water to keep the facility warm during the winter.  Last night (12/8) the low was approximately 7 F.4.	Statutory Authority:  	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 		Agency Requirements;	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,		 or Expert Services;	(  )  (4) International Agreement	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;	(  )  (6) National Security; or	(  )  (7) Public Interest5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  One of the two boilers at the Domiciliary has a cracked section.  It is leaking water in the boiler room and is unable to maintain pressure and provide much needed hot water to heat the facility in the middle of the winter.  Both boilers are required to keep up with the heating load at night.  At such, it must be repaired immediately before it fails completely.6.	Actions to Promote Competition:  In the future, the contracting specialist will conduct market research for any new vendors that offer this product.7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $ 6,712.  Previous purchase orders for similar work are 463-7533, $6067.86 and 463-PE4337, $5,945.85.  The price is determined to be fair and reasonable.8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  None.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  This contractor is a women-owned small business.9.	Other Considerations:  The proposed contractor is the only one that has worked on the mechanical system in the Domiciliary since the VA acquired the building in the mid-1990's.  They have worked on the boilers in the past, and are ready to go to work right away.  There is no time for a new contractor to "learn" the system, and we cannot risk any delays or suprises.  10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: Prior to making another sole source award to this vendor, the contracting specialist will research the market through the GSA E-Buy and Fed Biz Ops to ensure no other vendors can offer these items.12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  ___//signed//________________	____9 Dec 2009___________Name: Patrick Moran	DateTitle: EngineerFacility: VA Alaskan Health Care System13.
