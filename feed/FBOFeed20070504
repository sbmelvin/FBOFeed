Upon Government acceptance of an offeror(s?) fully operational smart card reader that is in full compliance with all specifications listed, for the second phase, the offeror(s) will then be issued an RFP for the replacements, additional spares, and maintenance requirement to replace the existing Smart Card Reader to the existing PACS, fully and wholly integrated with the PACS software as a fully operational and functional system. The GSA intends to award up to three contracts. The contractor(s) shall perform all work necessary to ensure complete day-to-day performance operational capabilities of the new smart card readers, to be incorporated into existing ACS Optical Portals.

This procurement is being solicited as an UNRESTRICTED requirement.    The applicable NAICS Code is 334119 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. This requirement shall be procured under Best value continuum, employing the source selection process, trade-off methodology IAW FAR Subpart 15.101-1.  The evaluation factors for this requirement will include the following:  Technical approach and capabilities, Management Approach, Past Performance, and Price.  The Government reserves the right not to convene discussions with successful offerors.  All offerors, whose proposals have been evaluated to be the highest rated in technical, and whose proposed prices were determined to be fair and reasonable for award, may be subject to a background check prior to receiving an award.  The solicitation will be issued on or about 21 May 2007.  The duration of initial phase of the requirement is approximately 60 calendar days after the issuance of the Notice to Proceed.

The tele-presence system will serve a multitude of purposes (including but not limited to the following): (1) Route video from up to 24 HD/SD/analog cameras (12 shipboard, 12 mounted on two remotely operated vehicles) to displays distributed throughout the ship, a video capture/storage subsystem, a video frame grab subsystem, a multi-view subsystem and a video encoder subsystem; (2) Provide a multi-view subsystem for viewing all of the available camera sources on a single display for use by ROV operators and science personnel; (3) Provide a frame grab subsystem capable of capturing and storing individual video frames from HD, SD and analog video sources for use as still imagery; (4) Stores up to three video feeds (possibly HD quality) for up to 20 days.  The stored video must be tagged with the capture date and time as well as the camera source; (5) Routes KVM, and individual VGA signals from up to 24 computers to 14 user stations and view-only LCD stations, distributed throughout the ship; (6) Provides video encoding/IP encapsulation capable of compressing and packaging multiple live, HD quality video for simultaneous transmission to shore-based destinations via satellite link; (7) Provide an intercom subsystem, capable of communicating not only with ship-based intercom stations but also with shore-based stations over an IP-based network via a satellite link.

Description of Operations: The NOAA Ship OKEANOS EXPLORER will operate in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, often in areas far offshore. The ship will be outfitted with a two-vehicle ROV system which will carry high-definition video cameras, still cameras, and oceanographic sensors to water depths up to 6,000 meters. The video signals and data will be transmitted from the ROVs to the ship through a 17mm electric/fiber-optic cable to an ROV control room onboard the ship.  ROV position information will be collected via an Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) acoustic tracking system also located in the ROV control room. The ship will be equipped with a multi-beam sonar system that will be linked to acquisition and map processing workstations co-located in the ROV control room. The objective of the tele-presence system is to ensure the information from these sources is appropriately distributed to work stations onboard the ship, as well as to ensure the information can be transmitted to shore.

Key Components: Key components and capabilities for the tele-presence include but are not limited to the following: Video encoding subsystem (with embedded audio); Video routing and switching; Multi-view video subsystem; Video format conversion HD/SD/analog; Video frame grab subsystem (HD/SD/analog sources); Video capture and storage subsystem; Onboard video editing workstation; Intercom subsystem; KVM and VGA matrices; and Video displays including: ROV control room (x3) 42 inch high-definition (HD), ROV control room (x4) 8 inch HD, Dry lab (x1) 25 inch HD, Equipment room (x4) 8 inch HD, ROV workshop (x1) 20 inch standard-definition (SD), and Bridge (x1) 20 inch SD.

Full delivery of the system will be required no later than ten (10) months from the date of award. Award is expected in the late August or early September, 2007 time frame.  The solicitation document will be available for download from the FedBizOpps website on or about May 21, 2007. No paper copies will be issued.

<DESC>Patient Safety Organization Privacy Protection Center

In response to the 2005 Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), will be soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis to establish a Patient Safety Organization Privacy Protection Center (PSOPPC).  The PSOPPC will conduct technical assistance and patient safety event data de-identification services for listed Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs). AHRQ is seeking offerors which have the capability to create, operate, maintain, and enhance the PSOPPC.  

We anticipate one award for a period of 3 years, with two 1-year options.  Options will be evaluated with the base period.  Options may or may not be exercised based on performance of the contractor and the needs of the Government.

The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act established a framework through which hospitals, doctors, and other health care providers can work to improve health care quality in a protected legal environment.  The Act extends legal privilege and confidentiality to health care providers voluntarily reporting patient safety events and ?close calls? to specially designated PSOs.  In turn, PSOs collect and analyze patient safety data in a confidential manner to develop and implement patient safety improvement strategies. Additionally, the Act authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ?facilitate the creation of and maintain a network of patient safety databases that provides an interactive evidence-based management resource.?  This network shall ?accept, aggregate across the network, and analyze non-identifiable patient safety work product voluntarily reported by patient safety organizations.?  The Act also allows the Secretary to specify common formats for the reporting of patient safety information to the network and to provide technical assistance to PSOs.

To facilitate the creation and operation of PSOs and minimize the reporting burden of PSOs contributing data to the Network of Patient Safety Databases (NPSD), AHRQ is evaluating the creation of a PSO PPC to offer technical assistance services to the PSOs, receive patient safety event information from PSOs and render this information non-identifiable. The PSOPPC will then transfer de-identified information to the NPSD.  This announcement is for the PSO PPC.  This solicitation is for the PSO Privacy Protection Center.  A separate solicitation will be issued for the Network of Patient Safety Databases.  

The PSOPPC will have several areas of focus. Currently, there is not an operational PSOPPC; therefore, the first activity will center on establishing a PSOPPC and its associated activities.  The PSOPPC will need to recruit PSOs to supply information, receive information from the PSOs, and provide the technical assistance to PSOs for sending data for de-identification. 

Patient safety work product submitted to PSOs is confidential and privileged.  The PSOPPC will prepare this data to be sent to the NPSD in a de-identified manner for analysis. A central activity will be related to the creation and application of protocols for rendering patient safety events non-identifiable and will include reviewing source information, ensuring information is consistent with common formats, developing  and applying rules for rendering information non-identifiable, and validating the de-identification process. 

Providing technical assistance to PSO will represent another key activity area for the PSOPPC.  This technical assistance will include establishing systems to respond to technical assistance inquiries, conducting needs assessments for technical assistance services, delivering a wide spectrum on technical assistance services including: planning and conducting workgroups, coordinating discussion forums, arranging individual consultations, developing tools and educational briefings for PSO activities, and maintaining an inventory of resources for the PSOs to utilize when conducting their charter.

Other key activities for the PSOPPC include planning, coordinating, and conducting a large annual meeting of the PSOs and the potential formation of ad hoc panels of expert for guidance on PSOPPC and NPSD activities.  The PSOPPC will also collaborate with partners (both private and public), including other Federal and State patient safety programs and AHRQ programs, to promote activities that support the goals and charter of PSOs. 
		
	The core team involved with operationalizing the PSOPPC will need several different skills sets and expertise representing the key activity areas.  The team must have demonstrated experience and knowledge related to patient safety improvement programs, patient safety work product, and reporting systems, health services delivery innovations, and implementing quality improvement, and other patient safety related activities that support the goals and charter of PSOs.  The team must have experience with the creation, maintenance and use of de-identified health care data, the secure handling of data files containing confidential and privileged personnel health information and the use of uniform data elements and standard configuration protocols for data analysis and reporting.

Due to the nature of the activities of the PSOPPC, the receipt of confidential and privileged patient safety work product and event information, and the creation of de-identified data from personal and protected health information, the offeror will need to have a significant level of knowledge and experience with the relevant legal regulations, policies and protocols.

Potential respondents to RFC should note that the separation of the functions of the PSOPPC and of the NPSD is intentional; the PSOPC will work with many different types of information supplied by PSOs while the NPSD will only handle standardized information that has been rendered non-identifiable.  Hence, an organization can receive the contract for only one entity, the PSOPPC or the NPSD, but not both.  Offerors may submit proposals for both projects, but would only be awarded one.

The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will be only available by downloading from the Internet through www.fedbizopps.gov or through the AHRQ website at www.ahrq.gov.  Potential offerors are responsible to monitor these sites for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for downloading on or about May 21, 2007.

<DESC>Network of Patient Safety Databases

In response to the 2005 Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is requesting proposals on a full and open competitive basis to establish a Network of Patient Safety Databases (NPSD).  The Network of Patient Safety Databases (NPSD) will receive, analyze and report on de-identified and aggregated patient safety event information. We anticipate one award for a period of 3 years, with two 1-year options.  Options will be evaluated with the base period.  Options may or may not be exercised based on performance of the contractor and the needs of the Government.

To facilitate a deeper level of analysis of patient safety events and to allow PSOs and providers access to an effective and robust resource for patient safety improvement,   AHRQ proposes to create and support a Network of Patient Safety Databases. The NPSD will also support regional and national analysis of patient safety information.  As currently envisioned, this Center will receive and maintain a database of non identifiable patient safety event information primarily from the Patient Safety Organization Privacy Protection Center (PSOPPC). It will have the capacity to secondarily receive non-identified, standardized patient safety information from PSOs not utilizing the PSOPPC and potentially from other entities. The NPSD will be charged with analyzing the non-identified information received and creating statistical reports useful to the patient safety community and to meet the reporting requirements of AHRQ. The database should also be maintained to allow a point of access for researchers. The NPSD will work in close coordination with the PSOPPC in the distribution of this analysis to the PSO and patient safety community. The center should be capable of offering technical assistance to PSOs if specifically requested by AHRQ.   

Specific work in this project will include establishing the NPSD, receiving non identified, standardized information on patient safety events from the PSO PPC (and other entities as practical and relevant), creation of statistical reports and tools for patient safety quality improvement, distribution of these reports and tools, and development of an interactive evidence-based patient safety resource providing a mechanisms to allow for external research.  

Providing Technical Assistance to PSO will represent an optional key activity area for the NPSD.   This Technical Assistance will include establishing systems to respond to Technical Assistance Inquiries, conducting needs assessments for Technical Assistance services, delivering a wide spectrum on Technical Assistance services including workgroups, discussion forums, individual consults, development of tools and educational briefings for PSO activities, and maintaining an inventory of resources for the PSOs to utilize when conducting their charter. 

Other optional activities for the NPSD include planning, coordinating, and conducting a large annual meeting of the PSOs and the potential formation of ad hoc expert panels for guidance on PSO PPC and NPSD activities. The NPSD will collaborate with partners (both private and public), including other federal and state patient safety programs and AHRQ programs, to promote activities that support the goals and charter of PSOs. 

	The core team involved with operationalizing the NPSD will need several different skills sets and expertise representing the key activity areas.  The team must have experience using de-identified health care data for trend and pattern analysis, the secure handling of data files containing confidential and privileged personnel health information and the use of uniform data elements and standard configuration protocols for data analysis and reporting.

Additionally, the team must have demonstrated experience and knowledge related to patient safety improvement programs, patient safety work product, and reporting systems, innovating in health services delivery and implementing quality improvement, and other patient safety related activities that support the goals and charter of Patient Safety Organizations
Due to the nature of the activities of the NPSD, the receipt of confidential and privileged patient safety work product and event information, and the use of this data for analysis and reporting, the offeror will need to have a significant level of knowledge and experience with the relevant legal regulations, policies and protocols.

Potential offerors to the solicitation should note that the separation of the functions of the Network of Patient Safety Databases and the Privacy Protection Center is intentional; the Privacy Protection Center will work with many different types of information supplied by PSOs while the Network will only handle standardized information that has been rendered non-identifiable.  Hence, an organization can receive the contract for only one entity, the Privacy Protection Center or the Network, but not both.  Offerors may submit proposals for both projects, but would only be awarded one.

The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will be only available by downloading from the Internet through www.fedbizopps.gov or through the AHRQ website at www.ahrq.gov.  Potential offerors are responsible to monitor these sites for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.

A.	INTRODUCTION: 

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate(DE) located at Kirtland AFB NM is interested in receiving proposals in the five technical areas under Light Innovation Technologies (LITE). The total program budget for these efforts is $24M over 60 months. The projected start date will be during the third quarter of FY07. 

Proposals are due by 12:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time, 27 March 2007.  PLEASE REALIZE THIS FUNDING PROFILE IS AN ESTIMATE ONLY, IS NOT A PROMISE FOR FUNDING, AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE DUE TO GOVERNMENT DISCRETION AND AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. AFRL will not issue a separate solicitation. AFRL is distributing this BAA electronically through FedBizOpps at http://www.fbo.gov. Once there, offerors should enter BAA 07-DE-02 into the search option to reach the posting. 

B.	REQUIREMENT DESCRIPTION/TOPIC AREAS:

Topic Area 1: Real-time Optical Surveillance Applications (ROSA)

	Technical point-of-contact:  Ms. Laura Ulibarri, AFRL/DESM 808-891-7737

	Technical solutions should address development of robust and pioneering algorithms and software tools that will process significant amounts of real-time Electro-Optic (EO) Space Situational Awareness (SSA) data and produce real-time, high-accuracy change detection information in very low light conditions, as well as software to integrate tasking and data integration from networks of EO sensors with disparate capabilities: wavelength coverage, imaging resolution, phenomenology, platform, etc. The next generation of EO SSA sensors must handle complex tasking and operations, and will require a minimal amount of human in the loop to ensure the correct objects were being tracked and the correct information was collected. Technologies developed will include intelligent agent autonomous algorithms, databasing, novel search techniques, and real-time processing software for anomaly detection and cueing of active (laser) and passive EO systems. Estimated funding is $10,000,000.

(In this area the Government contemplates an Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (ID/IQ) CPFF contract vehicle with an ordering period of 5 years. Offerors shall provide a technical proposal for the basic ID/IQ contract, and a cost and technical proposal for proposed initial Task Order plus an additional task order representative of the overarching Contractor Statement of Work for the basic contract. The initial Task Order should focus on development and demonstration of an initial proof of concept that provides a small scale demonstration of the capabilities for integrated tasking and fusion of networked EO sensors. It should be emphasized that we are looking for innovative solutions in this area that will provide the technical basis for enhanced Space Situational Awareness solutions. This effort should be completed within a year and within a budget of approximately $1.2M.  Offerors should contact the technical point of contact designated above for additional information regarding the focus of the first task order.) 

Topic Area 2: Adaptive Optics Improvements

	Technical POC LtCol Scott Hunt, 808-874-1513  and Dr Earl Spillar (DSN 246-6740, comm 505-846-6740)

	The Air Force Research Laboratories Optics Division would like to improve the reliability, maintainability, and performance of its existing adaptive optics systems for advanced research and development enabled by adaptive optics technology. In order to provide maximum flexibility this topic consists of two separate tasks. Offerors may propose to one or both tasks.

	SubTask 1?AMOS Adaptive Optics Tracker and Wavefront Sensor subsystems
	Requirements should address design and development of an improved Adaptive Optics Tracker and Wavefront Sensor subsystem for the Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing (AMOS) Site?s 3.6-meter telescope. Solutions providing high reliability, easy maintenance and high performance for high resolution imaging and sodium laser guidestar (Na LGS) beacon for dim objects are required. This effort should include ideas for developing a modular system and interface with the adaptive optics electronics identified in Task 2 of this topic area. Out-of-the-box thinking is encouraged to develop a low-latency system providing exceptional performance on dim objects. System reliability and performance are key, however re-use of existing system components may provide cost savings. This task will also cover integration and testing of the integrated tracker, wavefront sensor and electronics subsystem (developed under Task 2) prior to delivery as well as integration and testing with the 3.6-m telescope.
	SubTask 2?Adaptive Optics Electronic subsystem
	Requirements should address design and development of an improved Electronic subsystem for the Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing (AMOS) Site?s 3.6-meter telescope and Starfire Optical Range?SOR?s 3.5-meter telescope. A flexible adaptive optics electronics subsystem which is capable of interfacing with multiple AO Tracker and Wavefront sensor subsystems is required. Applications for this processor will require good latency supporting a large number of channels, and the desire is deterministic timing and data output from the processor to understand system performance. Flexibility to program multiple operating modes and adjust between various control modes on the fly is desirable. The processor should be flexible enough to accommodate additional channels to allow for expansion, such as the integration of a separate WFS for Na LGS operation and focus control.  Flexible collection and reporting of performance data, diagnostics to assist in integration and characterization of tracker, wavefront and optic subsystems is desired. The estimated funding is $3,300,000.


Topic Area 3: Advanced Research Adaptive Optics Prototype

	Technical POC, Earl Spillar, (DSN 246-6740, comm 505-846-6740)

	This task involves development of a research-grade AO electronics control prototype for advanced AO research.  Flexibility in the design should allow for testing of sophisticated reconstructors, sensors, and deformable mirror configurations.  For example, these sensors may include self-referencing interferometers, shearing interferometers or other advanced concepts.  The prototype should be able to accommodate a large number of actuators and sensed sub apertures, possibly distributed across multiple deformable mirrors.  Ability to develop, test and accommodate advanced reconstruction techniques for self referencing interferometers, exponential reconstructors, and other advanced concepts is required. The estimated funding is $500K.

Topic Area 4: Hyper/multispectral Data Reduction and Archiving (HyDRA) 

	Technical POC Mr. Bob Kim (DSN 263-7806, Comm 505 853-7806)

	For Spectral Geographic Information System database solutions to enhance target acquisition and fire control for tactical high energy laser systems, such as Relay Systems. This task will provide pre/post flight and real time software advancements in target identification and change/anomaly detection for multispectral and hyperspectral surveillance and targeting sensors.
HyDRA scope of interest to AFRL/VS as well?working to develop collaborations. The estimated funding is $10,000,000.

Topic Area 5: Advanced Architecture Concept Study for Advanced Beam Control

	Technical POC Dr Paul Merritt (DSN 263-5477, Comm 505 853 5477)

	Conceptualize innovative beam control architectures for conventional (single beam) systems such as advanced pointing and tracking systems.  These new concepts may apply to alignment jitter rejection, adaptive optics, gimbal pointing, tracking, pointing, or a combination of control functions.  An inertial reference shall be included if applicable. Size and weight will be a major consideration. Considerations for base motion and aero-optics are important. The estimated funding is $300K.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for 123 adaptive data voice multiplexers, RAD Data Communications part number DVMUX3/V/115/E/V24-FAA, for the FA-10391 Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME.) An engineering study showed that the RAD DVMUX3 SDM is the only SDM that would work in the FA-10391 VOR/DME and associated RSCE remote unit without extensive system modification.  A complete modification kit was developed to support the RAD DVMUX3 multiplexer installation into the FA-10391 VOR/DME and prototype installations have been installed and are currently working at three locations. Procuring an alternate multiplexer would result in re-engineering the modification kit and rewriting the System Support Modification document.  In addition, the prototype installation at the three test sites would no longer be compatible with the rest of the modified sites and the project would be significantly delayed. It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded to Pulse, Inc., Temecula, CA; RAD Data Communications' authorized value added reseller for this unit in the United States. This announcement is for information purposes only, not a request for offer.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a) with Aluma Tower Company, Inc., 1639 Old Dixie Highway, Vero Beach, FL 32960-3656 for the purchase of twelve (12) Telescoping Towers, twelve (12) Tower Anchor Kits, twelve (12) Anchor Installation Kits, and twelve (12) Tower Mounting Bases. Information received within 15 days after date of publication of the solicitation will be considered by the Government. Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, all responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 334220.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:  

AFRL/SNRT requires twelve (12) lightweight aluminum crank-up towers to be part of an experimental portable radar system. The towers being purchased will be used with existing inventory towers of the same type and model. Additionally, there is a variety of inventory replacement parts which facilitate upkeep of the existing towers. Purchasing different towers would require the purchase of a complete set of tower units and parts to facilitate upkeep. The combined savings associated with utilizing existing inventory and ordering fewer tower units of the same type outweighs ordering a complete set of new tower units and parts. The proposed source, Aluma Tower Company, Inc. is the only known source that can satisfy that government's requirement for the existing tower units and parts. No other units or parts can support the existing units and parts due to the unique requirements of the experiment.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is constructing a biological high containment National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick, Maryland (referred to as the IRF hereafter) to enable NIAID researchers to track disease process and clinical outcomes of select agents and other emerging infectious diseases.  The IRF was created to carry out biodefense research needed to understand the clinical disease processes that correlate with the severity of microbial-induced disease.  Central to the core mission of the IRF is the use of hospital tools such as endoscopy, cardiac telemetry monitors, and CT, MRI, SPECT, and PET imaging to systematically evaluate the pathogenic processes and clinical course of disease in animal models exposed to microbes. Research emphasis will be placed on high consequence infections requiring high levels of biocontainment: most Category A viral and bacteria pathogens plus newly emerging infectious disease microbes. In addition to addressing scientific questions related to microbes?  basic biology and disease-causing mechanisms (including microbial components that define a pathogen?s life cycle, transmission, virulence and invasiveness), a key goal is to correlate these findings with clinical test (telemetry and imaging) results.  Evaluation of these data in turn depends on development of animal models which faithfully replicate the human disease syndromes, including a respiratory route of exposure. This knowledge is crucial to the development of preventative and therapeutic strategies and will not only lead to improved medical outcomes at the hospital bedside but for public health in general.

The NIAID Acquisitions Management and Operations Branch (AMOB) has a requirement to provide all the Scientific, Technical and Administrative services required to operate and manage a NIAID Integrated Research Facility (IRF). The NIAID anticipates a three-year base contract with three possible award terms for potential of ten years in total. This is not a Request for Proposals.  The intention of this announcement is to notify potential offerors that the Request for Proposals will be available for download on or about May 14, 2007 from www.fedbizopps.gov.  No hard copies will be distributed.  All questions must be submitted in writing to Alexander Kramer (kramera@niaid.nih.gov).

<DESC>KAI Research, Inc. seeks to identify potential subcontract sources to assist in the development of an Immediate Practice-Altering Clinical Trials (ImPACT) program model as part of the work under their NINDS Prime Contract.  The goal of the NINDS ImPACT program is to reduce the burden of neurological disease by identifying high priority questions about best clinical care for patients with neurological conditions, and to facilitate practice-altering research that will answer those questions and improve care. 

A major component and the first step of the ImPACT program will be the development of a mathematical model that will provide an estimate of the potential impact on public health of any given clinical trial in neurology or neurosurgery.  The ImPACT program model will take into consideration the burden of the illness (including incidence, prevalence, financial impact and quality of life considerations) and the variety of possible results of the clinical trial.  A reliable, accurate estimate of public health impact would help to advise the Institute how best to advance its mission to lessen the burden of neurologic disorders and stroke through its clinical trials program.  Once completed, the model will be in the public domain.

The following tasks are considered essential to the development and completion of this model: 1) Identify the discoverable factors that will inform estimates of a clinical trial's potential public health impact, such as disease prevalence/incidence, changes in quality of life measurements, health care costs, and utilization rates, etc.; 2) Develop a model that will estimate the public health impact of any given potential clinical trial as a function of the trial outcome (development of such a model will require access to and must be based on data that are available and in the public domain); 3) Validate the model and establish its accuracy based upon analysis of previous clinical trials ; 4) Evaluate the relevance of the model in estimating the public health impact of clinical trials throughout the range of neurologic disorders. 

KAI Research, Inc. is hereby notifying potential sources of the request for proposals for assisting in the development and implementation of the above described model.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for Q600 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)/Differential Scanning Calorimeters (DSC) system (1 each). NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from TA Instruments Inc. The design of dual-beam balance system provides a true simultaneous measurement of heat flow (TGA) and weight change (DSC) on the same sample.	The Thermogravimetric Analysis and Differential Scanning Calorimeters will be determined by being used in a dual sample mode where separate signals are available from two samples which doubles analytical throughput. Automated furnace movement and a horizontal purge gas system with digital mass flow controllers and programmable gas switching capability will allow for greater precision in Thermogravimetric Analysis measurements. Accessories, consumables, and infrastructure already exist for the Q600, and lab users have been trained specifically on the TA Instruments system and software. The Q600 from TA instruments is the only company that meets the requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 15, 2007.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for enhancing the Operations & Support Cost Analysis Tool (OSCAT) in order to widen its applicability and usefulness to the NASA analyses community.  OSCAT consists of cost estimating relationships and costing methodologies that are used in establishing the life cycle operations and support costs of proposed air and space vehicles. These enhancements will be in three directions:  Updates to the cost estimating relationships and the data used by the model, the addition of new functionality to include a risk assessment, and modifications to reduce model dependency on the Resource and Maintainability Tool (RMAT) and thereby increasing the robustness of the model. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from the University of Dayton. The University of Dayton is the original developer of the RMAT and OSCAT models. Through their applied research on US Air Force aircraft they have a comprehensive library of data on cost elements associated with high performance flight and in the area of recoverable and consumable spares.	 As a requirement, the principle investigator must have a background with RMAT and OSCAT modeling and with high performance military aircraft and NASA vehicle life cycle costing methodology and Air Force cost element structures.  The methodology employed makes use of analogy, engineering cost estimates, and deriving cost estimating relationships (CER).  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 21 May 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>THIS WAS PREVIOUSLY SYNOPSIZED WITH THE REFERENCE NUMBER, 2007-N-09267, AS THE SOLICITATION NUMBER. 2007-N-09267 WILL BE THE SOLICITATION NUMBER. THIS SYNOPSIS WAS ISSUED TO REVISE TO A NAICS CODE THAT BETTER DECRIBES THE REQUIREMENT. This project entitled Enhancing Professional Development Among Education Agency Personnel and Others Who Work With Youth to Deliver Effective Education for Reducing Health Risk Behaviors Among Youth is sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH). The purpose of this project is to provide assistance to state education agencies (SEAs), local education agencies (LEAs), territory education agencies (TEAs) and select national non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to strengthen their ability to implement professional development activities that will improve the quality of health education programs addressing HIV prevention education, coordinated school health programs, physical activity, nutrition, tobacco, asthma, and other health priorities. Professional development at all levels is central to the success of such programs. One of the core elements expected of DASH-funded partners is professional development for teachers, administrators, school staff and others working with youth programs. To provide guidance for those efforts, CDC has developed and distributed CDC-DASH Six Strategies for Professional Development, and funded agencies through cooperative agreements or contracts to provide technical assistance with professional development efforts. The successful contractor will provide all of the personnel, materials and facilities required for the completion of tasks such as: Provide tailored professional development technical assistance; Develop a plan for providing continuing education for DASH-funded partner staff; Plan and implement professional development training; Collaborate to plan and coordinate professional development activities; Orient new DASH-funded project staff to the Contractor's services and available professional development resources; Assess the needs of DASH-funded projects related to professional development and advise the projects and CDC/DASH of such needs; Serve as a clearinghouse to gather and organize professional development resources and information and provide access to materials, conference information, speakers, trainers, and consultants identified. Award of a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract in accordance with FAR Part 15 is contemplated. The Government will consider all responsible small business sources responding to this Request for Proposals (RFP). The tentative issue date of the RFP is May 7, 2007.

29 September 2005, N68836-06-F-0364, dated 20 March 2006, and N68836-06-F-1668, dated 29 September 2006.  The system and system equipment are considered highly specialized equipment and award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost, including training to the Fleet, warranty costs, and maintenance of all systems.  These costs could not be recovered through competition and would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency?s requirements.  The equipment for the LMTS must be compatible with the existing systems to fulfill training requirements to avoid additional costs, as previously mentioned.  Naval Reserve Command will be issuing these systems, and previously purchased systems, throughout their respective commands.  

6.  Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable.  

The requiring activity and Contract Specialist have conducted market research among schedule holders, Thomas Register, and via the Internet.  The market research indicates no viable or compatible equipment exists.  In-house acquisition history indicates previous solicitations were advertised on GSA e-buy.  MPRI, Inc. was the sole offeror.  The requiring activity certifies, and the Contract Specialist confirmed, that the requirement can be met by a commercial item.  A commercial item determination is in the file.   

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.  

For the majority of items for this procurement, the General Services Administration (GSA) has already determined the price of supplies under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable.  However, the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Jacksonville, FL, as the ordering activity, will make the final reasonableness determination.   GSA negotiates contracts based on volume pricing, providing the Government with associated discounts not associated with open market procurements.  Therefore, the use of the schedule represents the lowest overall cost alternative and the best value to the Government.  For open market items, the Contracting Officer will be responsible for determining the price to the Government for the supplies/services covered by this J&A to be fair and reasonable.   

8.  Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.

For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, FISC Jacksonville has no plans at this time to compete future contacts for the types of supplies covered by this document. If other viable sources emerge, FISC Jacksonville will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible. 

9. Contracting Activity Point Of Contact:  

The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Jacksonville, Florida primary point of contact is Kelley C. Wall, Contract Specialist, (904) 542-0126.  The secondary point of contact is J.S. Jackson, Contracting Officer, (904) 542-1264.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Dilys Parry Ph.D., Bethesda, MD  20817, to provide medical geneticist services for a one year base period with one one-year option period.

The supplies and services herein are commercial as described in FAR Part 2 and the supplies and services are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.501.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.5.  

The Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB) of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics conducts studies to evaluate the interaction of host and environmental factors in cancer causation. One of the cornerstones of this research is family studies:  the interdisciplinary clinical, genetic, epidemiologic and laboratory evaluations of kindreds with or at high risk of specific cancers or tumors.  These investigations have provided important insights into cancer etiology. Through them GEB has been able to map susceptibility genes for a number of different familial cancer and preneoplastic syndromes, and become involved in isolating the genes, defining their functions and evaluating their roles in nonfamilial cancers in specific populations. By expanding the number of kindreds studied with different cancer and following them over several decades, GEB has been able to demonstrate the presence of genetic heterogeneity in some cancer syndromes, assess the occurrence of genotype-phenotype correlations, define the natural history, quantify prospective risks of cancers in members of some types of families, evaluate gene-gene or gene-environmental interactions, and integrate environmental risk factors into risk analyses.  The familial cancer syndromes studied by the branch include neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) and familial chordoma.  

The contractor shall perform the following tasks during the period covered by this procurement.

1)	The contractor shall provide recommendation and guidance on conducting the assembly and analysis of data and preparation of a manuscript on the long term follow-up of NIH NF2 patients.
a)	The contractor shall review the medical/research/vital records of each NF2 patient for completeness and provide guidance and recommendations for the retrieval of missing records;
b)	The contractor shall arrange for NF2 mutation testing to be carried out on DNA from patients for whom no NF2 mutation had been identified previously; 
c)	The contractor shall review the medical/research/vital records of each NF2 patient and prepare tabulations of clinical parameters, treatment types and outcomes by age, gender, family and mutation type;
d)	The contractor shall review the results of NIH clinical testing (audiology, ophthalmology, MR imaging results) on the NF2 patients with clinical experts at NIH;
e)	The contractor shall prepare a manuscript describing the results and conclusions of the long term follow-up for review by the project officer;
f)	The contractor shall prepare oral and/or poster presentations of results of the long term follow-up.

2)	The contractor shall provide recommendation and guidance on conducting the assembly and analysis of clinical data on the NIH chordoma families. 
a)	The contractor shall review the medical/research/vital records of each chordoma patient and examined family members for completeness and provide guidance and recommendations for the retrieval of missing records; 
b)	The contractor shall review the medical/research/vital records of each chordoma patient and prepare tabulations of clinical parameters, treatment types and outcomes by age, gender, and family;
c)	The contractor shall review the results of outside and NIH neuroaxis imaging studies  on the chordoma patients and examined family members with neuroradiologists  at NIH;
d)	The contractor shall review the medical literature on familial chordoma;
e)	The contractor shall prepare a manuscript describing the results and conclusions of the clinical evaluation of chordoma families studied at NIH and the chordoma families reported in the medical literature for review by GEB collaborators and the project officer;
f)	The contractor shall prepare oral and/or poster presentations of results of the review of familial chordoma.

3)	The contractor shall provide recommendations and guidance on gene mapping and other types of molecular studies on specimens from NIH chordoma families.
a)	The contractor shall provide guidance and recommendations for genotyping studies to be carried out on lymphocyte/buccal cell DNA from chordoma patients and examined  family members; 
b)	The contractor shall provide guidance and recommendations for molecular studies to be carried out on DNA from lymphocytes, buccal cells and tumors from familial chordoma patients; 
c)	The contractor shall provide guidance and recommendations on the development of manuscripts on gene mapping and other molecular studies of familial chordoma.

4)	The contractor shall provide recommendations and guidance on the design and conduct of studies to identify new multiplex chordoma families.
a)	The contractor shall make recommendations and provide guidance on the continuation of the collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital  and possible expansion to include individuals diagnosed with chordoma > age 18 years.
b)	The contractor shall make recommendations and provide guidance on the development of new collaborations with radiation oncologists and/or skull base neurosurgeons within the USA and countries outside of the USA to identify new chordoma families.
c)	The contractor shall provide recommendations and guidance for the clinical evaluation of individuals with chordoma and/or related tumors and their blood relatives from newly identified chordoma families.

5)	The contractor shall provide recommendations and guidance to support GEB family and gene mapping studies.

Contractor Requirements:  The contractor shall be a geneticist with board certification as a Ph.D medical geneticist and at least 20 years of experience in the ascertainment, clinical evaluation and counseling of individuals with NF2 and their close relatives and 10 years of experience in the ascertainment, clinical evaluation and counseling of individuals with familial chordoma and their close relatives.  The contractor must have at least 20 years of experience in leading and guiding clinical and gene mapping studies of families with preneoplastic disorders.  

Dr. Parry has provided medical geneticist support for high quality clinical and gene mapping studies of patients and families at increased risk for cancer for the DCEG for the past 30 years.  She had conducted research directed towards delineating syndromes and mapping genes that predispose to cancer. Her role in these studies included identifying patients and families of interest, obtaining and interpreting individual and family medical histories, delineating and arranging appropriate diagnostic studies and the procurement of research specimens, directing and participating in the clinical evaluation of family members, providing genetic counseling to affected and at risk family members and analyzing the data from the studies and preparing manuscripts for publication.  Over a period of almost 20 years, Dr. Parry directed the NCI studies that lead to the identification and cloning of the gene for neurofibromatosis 2, delineated the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with NF2 and elucidated correlations between the specific types of mutations in the NF2 gene and clinical findings.  As a result of these activities she was named NF Scholar of 2002 by Neurofibromatosis Inc., a national support group for patients with neurofibromatosis and their family members.  Over the last 10 years, Dr. Parry directed studies of familial chordoma that lead to the identification and clinical evaluation of 6 chordoma families and resulted in mapping a gene for the disorder to chromosome 7q.  Because of her expertise on familial chordoma she has been invited to be on the organizing committee for the NIH supported first international workshop on chordoma research. 

Dr. Parry?s working interactions with the NCI and extramural researchers on the NF2 and familial chordoma projects, her previous involvement in and understanding of the research and her in depth knowledge of clinical aspects of neurofibromatosis 2 and familial chordoma are unique assets that no other contractor could provide.  In addition, she is currently approved by the NIH Clinical Center to be involved in patient care there as a medical geneticist.  Therefore, there is no other medical geneticist who possesses the experience, expertise and detailed knowledge of these studies needed to allow him/her to immediately undertake the tasks covered by this procurement and conduct these efforts in a timely fashion.        
	
This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT May 14, 2007.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Deborah Moore, Contract Specialist, at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed to 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS IS CANCELLED. A NEW SYNOPSIS WILL BE ISSUED TO COREECT THE NAICS CODE. This project entitled Enhancing Professional Development Among Education Agency Personnel and Others Who Work With Youth to Deliver Effective Education for Reducing Health Risk Behaviors Among Youth is sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH). The purpose of this project is to provide assistance to state education agencies (SEAs), local education agencies (LEAs), territory education agencies (TEAs) and select national non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to strengthen their ability to implement professional development activities that will improve the quality of health education programs addressing HIV prevention education, coordinated school health programs, physical activity, nutrition, tobacco, asthma, and other health priorities. Professional development at all levels is central to the success of such programs. One of the core elements expected of DASH-funded partners is professional development for teachers, administrators, school staff and others working with youth programs. To provide guidance for those efforts, CDC has developed and distributed CDC-DASH Six Strategies for Professional Development, and funded agencies through cooperative agreements or contracts to provide technical assistance with professional development efforts. The successful contractor will provide all of the personnel, materials and facilities required for the completion of tasks such as: Provide tailored professional development technical assistance; Develop a plan for providing continuing education for DASH-funded partner staff; Plan and implement professional development; Collaborate to plan and coordinate professional development activities; Orient new DASH-funded project staff to the Contractor's services and available professional development resources; Assess the needs of DASH-funded projects related to professional development and advise the projects and CDC/DASH of such needs; Serve as a clearinghouse to gather and organize professional development resources and information and provide access to materials, conference information, speakers, trainers, and consultants identified. Award of a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract in accordance with FAR Part 15 is contemplated. The Government will consider all responsible small business sources responding to this Request for Proposals (RFP). The tentative issue date of the RFP is May 3, 2007.

<SUBJECT>56 -- DESIGN AND FABRICATE RADIATION SHIELD DOOR
<SOLNBR>174310-TW-07
<RESPDATE>051807
<ARCHDATE>06022007
<CONTACT>Thomas Williamson, Senior Procurement Specialist, Phone 702-295-4071, Fax 702-295-9137, Email williata@nv.doe.gov - Edwin Martin, Senior Procurement Specialist, Phone 702.295.0563, Fax 702.295.2088, Email martine1@nv.doe.gov
<DESC>A.	Provide materials, workmanship and installation oversight, including joints and fasteners that maintain continuity of RADIATION SHIELDING at all points and in all directions specified in thicknesses and locations indicated.
1.	Materials, thicknesses, and configurations indicated are based on RADIATION SHIELDING design prepared by CONTRACTOR?S radiation health physicist.  This design is available to SUBCONTRACTOR on request.
2.	A minimum of six (6) inches (30 cm) of Thermo Electron Corporation product Poly/Cast # 259 or equivalent encased in at least 1/2? carbon steel or stainless steel (A-36, 300 series stainless). The shield (door) shall overlap the sides of the entryway by approximately eight inches on each side and shall be as close as possible to the components mounted on the wall adjacent to the access.  The shield is to be located at the interior equipment airlock door. If hinging the shield is impractical due to anchorage or space requirements, the shield(s) can be on rollers and move on the floor across the entryway opening within the permitted space constraints. The shield shall be built such that in the closed position, it is as close to the floor as practical. The shield may be opened manually, motor driven, or both.  
3.	The existing blast door is to remain.  The shielding shall be designed and constructed so as to not interfere with the existing blast door assembly or working mechanisms.
4.	Shielding must be capable of being unlatched and operable by one person.  The latch may be a mechanical type latch such as a surface mounted doorbolt.
5.	Temperature Requirements:  
a.	Shielding must be fully operational at ambient temperatures from plus 55 degrees Fahrenheit to plus 95 degrees Fahrenheit.
6.	Electrical Requirements:
a.	All wiring connections as required, internal and external, shall be made on labeled terminal blocks.   Terminal blocks shall be placed in NEMA 1 enclosures and located adjacent to the doors on the interior of the existing airlock.  All wires shall be labeled.
b.	SUBCONTRACTOR shall provide a mounted ?tongue actuated safety interlock? switch as manufactured by Allen-Bradley model number MT-GD-2.  The door shall be reinforced as necessary with a mounting plate to receive the interlock switch and maintain integrity of the shielding.   
c.	Shielding shall be grounded.  
d.	A power failure will not cause the shielding to change its lock/unlock state.  
7.	Hardware Requirements:  Shielding shall have hardware to provide a fully operational and functional shield regardless of whether or not it is specified or shown on the drawings.
a.	Stops:  Wall mounted stops shall be provided at each leaf, as required, to prevent the shield or external accessories from making contact with the adjacent walls or building accessories within the swing radius of the leaf.  The design of the unit shall allow for the replacement of the rubber bumper.  Frame stops shall be provided at head and jambs only.
b.	Hinges:  Hinges shall be designed to resist reactions associated with normal and seismic loads.  They shall be designed to allow the leaf to open approximately 135 degrees.
c.	Latch devices:  Latch devices shall ensure the shield remains closed.
d.	The leaf(ves) shall be balanced such that they can be open and closed manually by a single person.
8.	Anchoring Requirements:  Shielding shall be supported on the existing concrete wall with anchoring devices as designed by SUBCONTRACTOR including, but not limited to base plates, anchor bolts and anchors.  Reinforcing steel in the concrete walls may not be cut during installation of the anchor bolts for the shield.  Anchoring designs must include the provision for a 2? tolerance on anchor bolt positions in any direction.  Attachment to existing blast door frames is not permitted.  Shield may be hinged and include rollers if required to support the weight of the leaf.
9.	Seismic Requirements:  The shielding, anchors, and connections shall be designed to resist seismic loading.  Horizontal and vertical seismic forces shall act simultaneously on the shield and frame.  Assume that excitation is applied along one of two orthogonal horizontal axes and is combined with the vertical direction.  Assume shields are open during a seismic incident.  For the purpose of seismic design for the shields, assume no other extraordinary forces are acting on the shield at the same time.
a.	Design Basis Earthquake (DBE)
1)	General:  Shield shall be designed to resist forces generated by the postulated DBE.
a)	Maximum Accelerations:
	East-West Direction = 0.41g
	North-South Direction = 0.40g
	Vertical Direction = 0.33g
b)	Directions are as indicated on reference drawings, Paragraph 1.1.A
2)	Structural Response to DBE:  Limit the structural response of the shield to prevent the shield from falling off the hinges when in any position.  Design the shield such that all stresses remain elastic.  The shield shall remain in place when closed.  The shield does not need to remain operable; it is only to stay on the hinges.

<DESC>The NHLBI is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Genomics and Informatics Center (GIC) for a new six-year multi-center clinical research study entitled ?SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS)?.  This observational study will collect and analyze phenotypic, biomarker, genetic, genomic, and clinical data from several thousand research subjects with COPD.  

Baseline data will be analyzed in a cross-sectional manner to identify subpopulations of patients with similar molecular abnormalities.  Longitudinal data will be used to identify and validate intermediate outcome measures, such as x-ray computed tomographic (CT) image, biomarker, and genomic measures whose spontaneous changes over a period of 9-12 months correlate with long-term (3 year) outcomes of mortality, frequency of hospitalizations, change in spirometry, and change in quality of life.  Secondary aims are to develop a bioinformatic infrastructure that will enable the utilization and sharing of pulmonary research data and to create a collection of clinical, biomarker, radiographic, and genetic data that can be used by external investigators for other studies of COPD.  

Research subjects will be enrolled, phenotyped, and followed at approximately five Clinical Centers (CCs) solicited under a separate request for proposals.  The GIC will have primary responsibility for establishing a repository of biospecimens; developing bioinformatic resources; performing high throughput genetic, genomic, and proteomic analyses of biospecimens; designing and implementing a strategy for data collection and analysis that will identify subpopulations and intermediate outcome measures; training CC staff; managing study data; providing overall management and oversight of the study; and disseminating study results.  Specifically, the GIC will: 1) provide expertise in genetic, genomic, and proteomic assays and analyses; 2) provide expertise in bioinformatics, including development of controlled vocabularies and metadata elements; 3) provide biostatistical support for study design and protocol development, including sample size calculations or simulations; 4) provide administrative support and oversight for the study as a whole; 5) process and store biospecimens collected at the CCs; 6) perform genetic, genomic, and proteomic analyses of biospecimens; 7) coordinate, plan, make arrangements for, and participate in meetings of the study committees and boards; 8) develop and maintain a web sites for study investigators; 8) establish and maintain a computer system and software needed for the storage and analysis of study data; 9) prepare and distribute periodic technical and statistical reports of study activities and progress; and 10) coordinate and track the reporting of adverse events.  GIC staff must possess strong scientific qualifications related to bioinformatics, biostatistics, genetics, genomics, and proteomics.  The GIC must have pulmonary medical expertise, experience in the supervision of complex multi-center clinical studies, and experience in the statistical analysis of high volume genetic, genomic, proteomic, and phenotypic data. 

Small business concerns that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this study should submit documentation of their capabilities to the Contracting Officer.  The capability statement submitted should include:  1) the total number of employees, 2) the professional qualifications of scientist, and technical personnel, 3) a description of general and specific facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software, and 4) an outline of previous research projects in which the small business organization and the proposed personnel have participated and any other information relevant to this program.  The capabilities statement must not exceed 10 single sided or 5 double sided pages in length. 
 
Interested small business organizations are required to identify their size standards in accordance with the Small Business Administration.  The government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI.   However, responses to this RFI that indicate that the information therein is propriety will be properly safeguarded for Government use only.  Responses should be emailed to Ms. Joanne Deshler at deshlerj@nhlbi.nih.gov.  Responses shall be submitted in Adobe Acrobat PDF format and received by 3p.m. eastern standard time on May 21, 2007.  Capability statements must include the name and telephone numbers of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. When submitting this information, please reference the solicitation notice number. Responses received after the due date may not be reviewed.

This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  If this program is approved for implementation and it is determined to be a small business set aside, then a competitive RFP will be set aside for small business concerns and will be available in FedBizOpps.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS), International Activities Office intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Zephyrus Electronics, Ltd. of Tulsa, OK 74128. Zephyrus will provide fifteen (15) complete turnkey systems that will be able to receive and display the GOES satellite data broadcast from the Emergency Managers Weather Information Network (EMWIN) system. The system will include a WX-13 EMWIN receiver, six (6) foot dish, NPRM, 150' RG-6 coax stainless steel hardware computer system that is preloaded with EMWIN, WX message and weather node software. These systems will be used in support of the Department of State's White House Third Border Initiative (TBI). The vendor will also provide training to various Caribbean island representatives in the use of the EMWIN system as an emergency tool to inform the public of critical weather information. These units will match identical systems already in use throughout the region. The commonality of the equipment will allow for users to form back-up support networks and gain easy quick integration with existing equipment. These units from Zephyrus comply and conform to NOAA's logistics, spare parts inventory and repair infrastructure currently in use in these remote sites. Selecting alternative models would result in significant additional costs for new training and a critical delay in the deployment of the systems during this upcoming hurricane season in this region, and an incompatibility with the other EMWIN systems deployed in the Caribbean. Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government?s requirement are invited to submit an affirmative response. To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to meet the existing training, and logistical requirements aforementioned. All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis. This is in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. A firm fixed-price purchase order is contemplated for this effort.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 21 May 2007. Please submit any and all written responses to Mark Miller via e-mail at Mark.A.Miller@ noaa.gov See Note 22.

<DESC>700MHz Wireless Broadband
The National Institute of Standards and Technology Office of Law Enforcement Standards (NIST/OLES), Boulder Laboratories, Boulder CO, is in the process of analyzing wireless broadband technologies for use by public safety agencies in the 700MHz spectrum.  The first step in this process is to determine what companies offer products that may fulfill the needs of public safety.  This is a Request For Information (RFI) announcement and NOT A SOLICITATION.  Respondents are not limited to NAICS Code 517212.  The responses provided by the vendors will allow us to compile the necessary information to help public safety make informed choices on broadband equipment as well as help NIST/OLES better understand the available technologies better.

Disclaimer

It should be fully understood by all companies who provide responses to this document that this is in no way is an endorsement from NIST/OLES.  The information given to NIST/OLES is strictly for research purposes.  At no time should press releases or any type of sales brochures references be made with regards to this process.

It should also be understood that any and all information provided, unless specifically noted by the company, will eventually be made available to the public safety community.  If specific information is covered by an existing NDA, this should be clearly described in the reply.
 
Spectrum

24MHz of spectrum has been allocated to public safety use.  This spectrum is a result of digital television channel clearing that is taking place and will be completed nationwide by 2009.  The proposed FCC rulings allocate 12MHz of paired spectrum (24MHz total) for nationwide public safety use.  Public Safety broadband will occupy 5~6MHz per channel (10~12MHz total) of the 24MHz allocated.  The FCC has many proposals that have been submitted for comment.  In general the broadband frequencies cover the following spectrum and any equipment specified in the RFI should be able to operate within this frequency range.
?	First band covers 763 ? 776MHz (Typically Basestation Tx)
?	Second band covers 793 ? 806MHz (Typically Basestation Rx)

NOTE: Broadband references channel sizes greater than 1Mhz

The 700MHz A, C & D blocks are spectrum that may be auctioned off for commercial use or for use in a public/private trust for public safety broadband use.  There are several proposals for use of this spectrum from industry.  At the time of this RFI it is unknown what the outcome will be on these spectrum blocks.  However, it should be noted that whatever analysis and recommendations are created from this project will, and should, be compatible and interoperable within this spectrum block.

Wireless Broadband Technologies

Several known technologies could satisfy the needs in this spectrum ? others may be viable but are not part of this project scope.  It is the desire to take advantage of COTS products and the economies of scale to help advance the technology into the marketplace quicker and reduce costs to public safety.

?	IEEE 802.16e ?Mobile WiMax?
o	Both Time Division Duplex (TDD) and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) should be considered
?	IEEE 802.11xx ?Mobile WiFi?
?	IS-856 ?EV-DO Revision A & B?
?	3GPP2 ?UMB ? Ultra Mobile Broadband? or EV-DO Revision C
?	3GPP Release 5/6 ?WCDMA, UMTS, HSPA?  
o	Both TDD and FDD should be considered
?	3GPP Release 8 ?LTE ? Long Term Evolution? 
o	Both TDD and FDD should be considered

 
IP Convergence

The RFI is inclusive of the entire ecosystem required for a broadband network.  In addition to the radio technologies being investigated, the IP ?backbone? is also being explored. 

Due to potential frequency spectrum issues and the cost of deploying a nationwide wireless network ? the broadband network will need to be shared across agencies and likely jurisdictions.  The convergence of subscriber user information, applications and overall IP access will need to take place.  There seems to be overall acceptance of the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) architecture by the prevailing broadband standards bodies.

Request For Information Questions

The next nine sections contain questions and requirement statements on the specific information we need to gather on 700MHz broadband equipment.  Please provide as much information about your current or future products that can address these questions and statements.

Minimum Feature & Functionality Requirements

The following chart is an example of the typical wireless data services required by public safety.  This is only an example is not necessarily representative of all of the wireless data requirements for public safety.

Network Architecture
The 700MHz public safety broadband network will likely be based upon a mobile IP (MIP) network and will require a higher level of redundancy than typical wireless networks.  The use of IPv6 is the preferred option and to deploy with this type of implementation.  All network equipment must be upgradeable to IPv6 from IPv4.  It is understood that IP migration may need to take place.  Please provide any information pertinent to this subject.

Most of the architecture for wireless and cellular based networks do not provide redundancy for the IP network.  The project is also investigating the concept of a ?flat IP? implementation.  A ?flat? network would have the home agent (HA) at the network edge ? likely collocated within the BTS.  This would allow significant IP routing capabilities and support the use of multiple backhaul facilities (fiber, microwave) and offer another level of redundancy to support redundant core networks.  Please provide any information pertinent to a ?flat IP? network implementation. 

1.	Provide a network or system architecture diagram showing interconnects from the BTS through to the core network.
2.	What QoS levels are supported
3.	Provide end to end call setup and teardown delays for different QoS levels
4.	Provide details on broadcast and multicast services/channels 
a.	How is the message structure setup
b.	How are the channels managed differently 
c.	What impact on capacity does using this service have
5.	What priority access levels are allowed in the proposed system and how are they implemented?
6.	Provide information on how the proposed system would handle the following priority and overload condition issue:  In a single sector of coverage you have a large number of users.  The number of users is much, much larger than what the system is designed. In an emergency/overload situation where everyone in sector tries to setup a call at nearly the same time how does the system handle this and in particular: 
a.	If the ?access channel? (used generically) is overloaded with requests, how are collisions avoided or mitigated? 
b.	How are users with priority access (public safety) given that priority access when this situation happens?


Subscriber Options

<ARCHDATE>06052007
<CONTACT>Eva Sanchez, Contract Manager, Phone 310-653-3920, Fax null, Email eva.sanchez@losangeles.af.mil - Eva Sanchez, Contract Manager, Phone 310-653-3920, Fax null, Email eva.sanchez@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>This is an update to the Request for Information (RFI) and Sources Sought Synopsis posted on 1 February 2007 (Reference Number SMC-07-0001).  The Global Positioning Systems Wing (GPSW), Los Angeles AFB, has a requirement for Defense Advanced GPS Receivers (DAGRs) or equivalent.  At this time, the Government is anticipating a Sole Source Follow-On Contract with an estimated RFP release in fourth quarter FY07.  The probable ordering period will begin second quarter FY08 and extend through FY16, with a potential contract value of $650M.  The purpose of this notice is to determine if there are existing products that meet the requirements of the DAGR Specification, SS-M/V-600B.  For the DAGR Follow-on RFP, the GPS Wing anticipates a new specification, version SS-M/V-600C, which includes updates to reference documents and incorporates Specification Change Notices (SCNs).  Most importantly are the features related to the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM).  Equal products (DAGR and accessories), shall provide the capabilities of the current DAGR, to include, but not limited to: worldwide positioning and navigation through continuous tracking of all satellites in view, direct Y- code acquisition, SAASM architecture unclassified-when-keyed operation and updated security features, upgradeable capabilities; and be interoperable with the PLGR/DAGR.  Performance and interface requirements are also contained in the DAGR Specification.  The current DAGR is manufactured by Rockwell Collins Inc.  Potential bidders may obtain access to the current specification and reference documents under the BIDDERS-DAGR-FOLLOW-ON repository through the online GPS Wing Program Library (includes Bidders Library) by contacting John Pezan at gpslibrary@losangeles.af.mil or telephone at (310) 653-3208 or Capt Bryan Hogan at Bryan.Hogan@losangeles.af.mil, telephone (310) 653-3120.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Note:
The Department of Defense (DoD) recently mandated the PKI infrastructure requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to authenticate users via digital identification certificates, rather than the common User ID and Password.

As of 1 August 2006, before accessing the GPS Wing Program Library system each user must have at least one of the following PKI components:

DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or
DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html

Planned Contract Format:
(a) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract with option CLINs for DAGRs plus warranty and accessories.  Customers differ in their choice of accessories ordered with their DAGRs.   The following list is often ordered on a one to one ratio with DAGRs: RA-1 Antenna, DAGR to RA-1 Cable, Installation Mount, DAGR to External Power Cable, DAGR to DAGR/PLGR Cable, DAGR to PC Cable, Personnel Case, Computer Based Training (CBT), O&M Manual and Pocket Guide. (ref. Attachment 1- H Clauses, SMC H- 010)  The current DAGR contract includes 39 different accessories as part of an ongoing commitment to customer requirements.   The RFP may include a modification to existing accessories and/or the potential for new accessories.  

(b) Two production order options (DAGRs and accessories) are planned each year (approximately January and June), with the flexibility to move that schedule and to place additional orders if each order is valued at $1M or higher (ref. Attachment 1 - H Clauses, SMC H- 010)
(c) Technical Services CLIN(s) will be Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee (CPFF) (ref. Attachment 2 - CLIN Examples)
(d) Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs) (ref. Attachment 3 - Summary CDRL List)
(e) Integrated Master Plan (IMP), Software Management Plan, Information Assurance Plan, Integrated Master Schedule (IMS), Statement of Work (SOW), and Logistics plans are required as part of any proposal for this effort and will be incorporated in the contract, further description of requirement provided in reference (ref. Attachment 4 - Preliminary Portion of Section L and Attachment 5 - Section B through G clauses)
(f) The Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) portion of the Integrated Master Plan (IMP) is an essential part of the DAGR program.  The P3I plan is designed to improve the DAGR and its' accessories based on user inputs, which are reviewed by the Human Factors Working Group.  A potential P3I activity scheduled to commence in FY08 with an estimated production impact in FY10, is a manufacturing design improvement that utilizes a Single Die Key Data Processor (KDP).  This improvement would require commitment of funds and action on the part of the Government and significant commitment by the DAGR producer.  It is expected that this change would dramatically lower the recurring price of the DAGR by lessening manufacturing cost and risk.  It would also lower operating costs to customers by reducing power requirements for DAGR operation.  The Follow-On RFP will include a description of this P3I effort.  Offerors will provide an optional pricing table for the DAGR, contingent upon successful completion of this P3I. 

Price:
(a) Target price for DAGR (including 5 year warranty) must be less than $2,000/unit.
(b) Variable quantity pricing tables for the DAGR, accessories, and drawing packages is required (ref. Attachment 6 - Variable Quantity Pricing Table Example)

Schedule:
(a) DAGR Follow-on effort may result in a contract award with options to be exercised at a later date 
(b) Exercise of the first option hardware CLIN(s) is expected in the second quarter of FY08 (ref. Attachment 1 - H Clauses, SMC H- 010)
(c) Delivery of DAGRs and accessories must start within 6 months after receipt of order (ARO) and be completed within 18 months after commencement of deliveries (ref. Attachment 1 - H Clauses, SMC- H007)

Additional program requirements are listed below:

Manufacturing capability: 
(a) Proven manufacturing capability (complexity, quality and volume) of same/similar product
(b) Ability to sustain an average rate of 5,000 receivers a month
(c) Approved SAASM vendor as prime or as subcontractor
(d) No GFP will be provided to assist in manufacturing or materials supply

Logistics:
(a) Agree to warranty (ref. Attachment 1 & 2)
(b) Ten year service life is required for the DAGR
(c) Provide depot supply support at no additional cost for the ten year service life (ref. Attachment 1 & 2)
(d) Agree to process for warranty exclusion repair.  Warranty exclusion repair will managed by the local DCMA office.  Agreement will be reached between Contractor and DCMA on which repairs are under warranty and which are considered warranty exclusion.  The warranty exclusion cost will be negotiated with the local DCMA until an average rate is negotiated, after that point the average cost will be reevaluated every 6 to 12 months and adjustments made if necessary. (ref. Attachment 1 & 2)
(e)  The RFP will include two option CLINs to support the transition from Contractor Logistic Support to organic depot capability.  Option one will address requirements to transition software support from the contractor to the Government.  Option two will address the transition of repair and logistic support capability from the contractor to the Government.  A notional description of the organic support requirements for these option CLINs will be provided with the RFP.  Offeror shall provide a detailed plan to transition either option one, option two or both.  This plan should also include description of any cost/schedule impacts to other program CLINs.         
(f) Provide a pricing table for Level 3 drawing packages for accessories other than the antennas (ref. Attachment 1 - H Clauses, SMC H- 010)
(g) Computer Based Training (CBT) (CD and website format), Operation & Maintenance (O&M) manual (CD and paper copy), the DAGR Pocket Guide (electronic and paper copy) and Instructor Key Personnel (IKP) Training (documents and classroom training) are required, requirements defined in CDRLs.

Program Management:
(a) Quarterly Integrated Product Team meetings and weekly teleconferences

Security:
(a) This acquisition will contain classified material.  The production contract will contain a Contract Security Classification Specification (DD254).  Work performed under this acquisition may be classified up to and including the SECRET level.  Offerors must comply with security requirements found in the Navstar GPS Protection Guide.  Offerors must have Facility Clearance of at least the Secret level.  At the time of award of the production contract, the contractor must have a GPS COMSEC account with the Government.  (b) Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms: US procurement contracts for GPS Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) equipment must be awarded to US companies.  Foreign teaming, licensing, or subcontracting are allowed; however, the participating companies must clearly demonstrate that the hardware and software implementing the GPS cryptography are designed, built and integrated within US borders by US companies.  This requirement must be separately auditable.  (ref. Attachment 7 - Preliminary DD254, Contract Security Classification Specification found in the GPSW Bidder's Library)

The CDC shall partner with the INCEF to create several culturally-tailored, local language videos (suitable for low-literacy settings) that will be used to educate at-risk populations about monkey pox and monkey pox prevention.   A contract shall be issued to INCEF who will provide trained Congolese staff locally in Brazzaville, and maintain a formal working relationship with the Congolese Ministry of Health and Populations.  INCEF shall also provide the materials and equipment required to complete the tasks outlined herein in multiple languages (Lingala, French, and English) with and without subtitles.  The following are required tasks to develop and create the educational videos: (1)    Planning and preproduction (year 1); a.     development of technical/health guidelines, in collaboration with CDC, b.   creation of narratives; outline of desired footage, interviews, and c.  collect feedback from CDC and international partners (WHO).

The primary purpose of this contract is to carry out the construction of the perimeter walls and the installation of the anti-ram bollards of the USAID/Guatemala Interim Office Building (IOB). While other local construction companies may be able to construct the perimeter walls and place the bollards, they have not been cleared for access to the construction security standards or blast analysis that have been provided to PRECON by the Overseas Buildings Office (OBO), the Diplomatic Security (DS) and USAID Security (USAID/Sec) for the construction of the USAID/Guatemala Interim Office Building. In addition soil and environmental impact studies have already been completed by the landholder, PRECON, and permits to construct the perimeter walls. To obtain clearance for information access and to submit another design package would take several months, months that would be detrimental to our IOB schedule and successful completion of the IOB. The Mission does not anticipate contracting this type of services in the future as this is a specific project that will be finalized by the end of the calendar year 2007.  This contract is being proposed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 which states that full and open competition need not be obtained when there is ?only one responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements?. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement within 15 days of publication of this notice.  In accordance with FAR 5.207 (c) (xv), all responsible sources may submit to the Point of Contract a bid, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This is a sole source requirement and we will proceed with the award on that basis.  No solicitation is available.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm . The Government intends to negotiate a modification to existing contract number N00164-05-D-6661 to increase the ceiling value in order to complete current tasks and related tasking that have been started under this contract.

The Government is in the process of initiating a task order under the Seaport contract to meet future requirements.  It is anticipated that the Seaport task order will be awarded approximately late November.  This modification will only accommodate requirements that exist before the award of the Seaport task order and will only accommodate requirements directly related to work that has already been performed under this contract.  The existing contractor is Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC) of Johnstown, PA.  Negotiations will be held on a sole source basis!   with CTC in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  Thus, numbered note 22 applies.  Based on the fact that the Government intends to execute a modification to the existing contract, no formal solicitation will be issued.  This notice is being executed in accordance with FAR 5.2 because it is anticipated that the modification to the existing contract will exceed $25,000.

<SUBJECT>59 -- TriMech Solutions
<DESC>This notice is being publicized in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101 requiring Contracting Officers to disseminate information for proposed contract actions expected to exceed $25,000.  Further in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 it is the intent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to make award to the TriMech Manufacturing.

The Office of Investigative Technology requires the procurement of a one Dimension SST 1200 3D Printer and all ancillary equipment and associated services.  The unique specifications and qualifications of this vendor and its product are required by the DEA.  Based on the patented Stratasys FDM process, Dimension builds functional 3D models from the bottom up, one layer at a time with a tough, durable acrylnitrile butadene styrene (ABS) plastic.  ABS parts can be sanded, milled, drilled, tapped, painted, and electro-plated.  Our investigation has found no other vendor that can satisfy the requirement.  As a result it has been determined that TriMech Solutions is the only responsible source to provide the necessary equipment.  It is the sole reseller of the Dimension 3D Printer for Virginia.

If there are any concerns or issues with regard to DEA's intent please contact Troy Teachey at (703)495-6516, or troy.t.teachey@usdoj.gov.

<DESC>1.	INTRODUCTION: 

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate (DE) located at Kirtland AFB, NM is interested in receiving proposals in two separate technical areas:  Topic Area 1 -  development of a 20 kHZ Frame Rate, Low Noise Wavefront Sensing and Tracking Short-wave Infrared Camera.  The total program budget for the technical effort is $500k to $1M per year for three years.    The project office for  Topic Area 1 is Capt. Jetter DESE.  Topic Area 2 ? development of designs for advanced supersonic diffusers for chemical oxygen-iodine lasers (COIL).  The total program budget for the technical is $1M over two years, with initial funding of $150,000.  The project office for Topic Area 2 is Tim Madden DELC. 

TOPIC AREA l -The Starfire Optical Range (SOR) is soliciting innovative research proposals for developing a 20 kHz frame rate, low noise wavefront sensing and tracking short-wave infrared (SWIR) camera.  The sensor will be integrated into an adaptive optics brassboard testbed as a self-referencing interferometer (SRI) wavefront sensor.  The delivered camera system will consist of a detector and housing, associated electronics needed to amplify and digitize the detector signal, electronics housing, cooling hardware, and documentation.  The program will consist of 4 possibly overlapping phases:

Phase 1 will cover the design of a Readout Integrated Circuit (ROIC) and layout / fabrication of a test chip.

Phase 2 will cover layout, fabrication and test of the production ROIC chip.

Phase 3 will cover camera electronics design.

Phase 4 will cover camera fabrication and integration with ROIC.

Should the need and funding arise, additional quantities of the camera developed through this effort may be required. 

A significant goal of this effort is the reduction of the unit cost of production units of the resulting camera design, as compared to state-of-the-art cameras, as well as scalability of the design architecture in both frame rate and format.

TOPIC AREA 2 ? The US Air Force Research Laboratory Directed Energy Directorate (AFRL/DEL) seeks innovative proposals in the development of designs for advanced supersonic diffusers for chemical oxygen-iodine lasers (COIL) to be tested at AFRL/DE facilities.  The goal for this effort is to develop supersonic diffuser hardware that provides dramatic advances in pressure recovery system size and performance.  The developed design(s) should at the minimum be 90% of the pressure recovery performance of a normal shock for typical COIL operating conditions at the laser cavity exit.  Demonstrated experience with engineering approaches to compact configurations is of high importance due the unique manner in which these diffusers operate in conjunction with the chemically reacting flows issuing from COIL devices.  Full documentation of developed designs will be required in addition

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

This study area includes the watersheds of: Johnson Creek; Big Elk Creek, Middle Big Elk Creek; Feagles Creek; Rail Creek; Cougar Creek; Beaver Dam Creek; Baker Creek; and Sugarbowl Creek of the Coastal Range of Oregon.

All remotelysensed data shall be acquired between October 15th and November 20th, 2005. The exact data acquisition dates within the specified period will be agreed upon, prior to the data acquisition mission, by the Forest Service (FS) and the contractor, based on forest senescence seasonality and weather.

The Contractor will: 
	Obtain LiDAR data for the study area using an Optech 3100 instrument

Specifications of LiDAR data:
	Return Density:	Minimum of 4 per square meter
	Mean beam spacing:	Maximum of 0.50 meters both along and cross track
	Beam divergence:	0.3mRad 
	Flight swath sidelap:	50%

Deliverables:
All final products shall be delivered on portable hard drive(s) with USB-2 connectivity.  All digital data and the portable hard drives will become property of the FS.  All digital data shall be in ASCII or Arc/INFO grid or coverage format in the projection parameters stated below.  All coordinate, LiDAR return intensity, and DEM values shall have a minimum of two-digit precision.

All spatial data shall be in Arc/INFO coverage or GRID format with the following projection parameters:
	Projection: 	UTM

STATEMENT OF WORK
1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES. The contractor shall provide all management, tools, supplies, equipment, and labor necessary to ensure the tilling of petroleum-contaminated soils and general grounds maintenance are performed at Grand Forks Air Force Base?s Land Treatment Facility (LTF).  The LTF is located northwest of the Alert Ramp on the west side of the base.  
1.1. MAINTAIN GROUNDS.  
1.1.1.  Tilling.  The Contractor shall provide tilling of petroleum-contaminated soils (PCSs) during the growing season IAW NDAC 33-20-09-02.4.d.  Tilling, in the conventional sense of actually using a garden tiller, can be used to accomplish this task.  However, a disc, chisel plow, or some other method approved by 319 CES/CEV would also be acceptable.  The existing PCSs, consisting of approximately twenty (20) acres, shall be tilled four (4) times during the 2007 growing season.  The first tilling shall take place within 15 days of notice to proceed, weather permitting, with the fourth tilling taking place approximately 1 Oct 07.  PCSs introduced during the growing season shall be tilled as many times that remain in the growing season; evenly spaced between the first and fourth tilling, weather permitting.
1.1.2.  Remove Debris/Police Grounds.  The Contractor shall remove material such as concrete, rebar, wood, or other inert construction debris that may be present in some of the PCSs requiring tilling.  The Contractor shall remove these materials as they become evident from tilling and properly dispose of them at an offbase location in accordance with existing local, state, and federal regulations.
1.1.3.  Grounds Maintenance:
The boundaries of the LTF (Exhibit A) are the berms along the west (A-B), north (A-D), and east (C-D).  The south boundary is defined by the southern edge of the road (B-C).
1.1.3.1 Mowing/Trimming.  Grounds maintenance tasks at the LTF shall include all grasses, birch, and tree saplings.  The following areas shall be mowed, trimmed, and maintained two (2) times during 2006 as directed by 319 CES/CEVC. 
?	All berms, including the boundary berms and all interior berms;
?	Areas not utilized for soil remediation or tilled within the boundaries;
?	An additional twelve (12) feet beyond the berms and LTF road;
?	A five-foot radius around each of nine monitoring wells (MW); and,
?	Twelve (12) feet around the gate and entrance sign.
2.  GENERAL:
2.1.  QUALITY ASSURANCE. The government will periodically inspect and evaluate the contractor?s performance.
2.2. GOVERNMENT REMEDIES.  The contracting officer shall follow the requirements of FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions for Commercial Items (May 1999), for contractor?s failure to correct nonconforming services.
2.3. CORRECTIVE ACTION.  The contractor shall, upon receipt of a notice in writing of any noncompliance with the foregoing provisions, take immediate corrective action.  If the contractor fails or refuses to comply promptly, the contracting officer may issue an order stopping all or part of the work until satisfactory corrective action has been taken.  No part of the time lost due to any such stop orders shall be made the subject of a claim for extension of time or for excess costs of damages by the contractor unless it was later determined that the contractor was in compliance.
2.4.  EQUIPMENT.  Equipment brought on site shall be in good working order and not be leaking any fluids.  All subcontractors shall be licensed, if applicable.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) must accompany all chemicals brought onto GFAFB.

<SUBJECT>56--Embankment Material for Levee Rectification
<SOLNBR>IBM07Q0007
<RESPDATE>050807
<ARCHDATE>05232007
<CONTACT>Colleen Elliott, Contract Specialist, Phone (915) 832-4714, Fax (915) 832-4192, Email colleenelliott@ibwc.state.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions received, revise the scope of work, change estimated quantities and notify prospective quoters of access maps with revised routes as well as figures with approximate quantities and placement along the levee.  
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (Q&A):
Q:  I do have a couple of questions to ask before proceeding.  I talked to our prepresentative that visited during the site visit.  He mentioned that since there were several questions in place, the bid submittal cut-off date may be delayed to Friday, May 4th?
A:  The only questions received in writing were from AIW, Inc.  The deadline for receipt of quotes was extended to May 7,2007 and is extended by this amendment to the solicitation until May 8, 2007.  
Q:  If possible, I would appreciate it if you answer some of the questions in mind.  According to the section II DESCRIPTION, it states ?The material shall be furnished from the same material source throughout the duration of the contract.?  As a contractor, I have two material locations at different ends of the project (the product is from the same company, just different quarries).  To save money for USIBWC, is it possible to use the two material locations or does it ?have? to be from one location throughout the project?  This will lower the amount of shipping the product in a drastic manner.  
A:  Up to three sites may be used, see the revised SCOPE OF WORK for changes to sections II DESCRIPTION, VII MEASUREMENT OF MATERIAL, and VIII SUBMITTALS in this amendment.  
Q:  Another question that I feel should be addressed is that at Chihuahita access location, the trucks will be required to cross railroad tracks.  In that event, since there will be a lot of truck traffic, the trucks are required to have a ?flagger? from the Railroad company to be on-site to let the trucks cross over the tracks.  This in turn may take time to register with the RR and get a ?flagger? out on location (we have run into this problem in the past).  Do we (contractor) factor into the price of a the ?flagger? in our quote or will USIBWC provide that?  
A:  The American Dam Project Office will provide the necessary flagmen during the delivery of the material through the Chihuahuita Railroad crossing.  
Q:  Last questions:  If possible, is there a breakdown of how much material will be delivered to each access location?
A:  The estimated quantity for embankment material has been revised, see SCOPE OF WORK for changes to section II DESCRIPTION and III PROJECT LOCATION.  
(vi)  SCOPE OF WORK:  
(II)  DESCRIPTION, Change the first sentence to read:  The Contractor shall furnish approximately 50,000 tons to be delivered on USIBWC levees from International Dam to Riverside Dam.  Change the last sentence to read:  The material shall be furnished from no more than three material sources/borrow sites and/or quarries throughout the duration of the contract.  Add the following at the end of the section:  A table is available, upon request, with the approximate tons of embankment material per mile, including the approximate distance from beginning of Chamizal Channel (Upstream Mile No.), and approximate geographic location.   
(III)  PROJECT LOCATION, Add the following sentences:  Maps showing areas to be filled are available upon request from USIBWC.  These maps include all areas to be filled downstream of the Chamizal Channel only, and do not include the reach between Chamizal Channel to International dam.  Estimated length of levee needing fill in the areas is 0.5 miles.  No fill will be placed along Chamizal Channel.  
(V) MEASUREMENT OF MATERIAL, Second paragraph, revise the first sentence to read:  Prior to the first delivery and for each material source, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR) written reports of calibrations for a scale mechanic licensed by the Texas Department of Agriculture using certified weights, certifying that the scales meet the requirements of  Item 520.    
(VII) SAMPLING AND TESTING, B. Frequency of testing, revise the first sentence to read: ?For each material source, the Contractor shall:  (a) test once prior to initial delivery and every two weeks for the duration of use of the source for the project for:  gradation and plasticity index (Contractor is to notify the COR at least three (3) days prior to taking?).  
(VIII) SUBMITTALS, Paragraph A, revise to read:  The Contractor shall submit, within five (5) calendar days after receipt of Notice of Award, the source(s) for embankment proposed for use.  
(X) ACCESS TO USIBWC LEVEES, Add the following sentence to the end:  Three (3) additional maps of possible haul routes are available from USIBWC.  
(xvi)  Quotes are due to the USIBWC, Acquisitions Division, 4171 N Mesa, Suite C-100, El Paso, TX  79902-1441 by 2:00 p.m. MDST on May 8, 2007.

<DESC>Leaf-off LiDAR Data Acquisition and Processing- provide aircraft services to collect data with a LiDAR Instrument(Optech 3100) 
There are two bid items for this project.  

BID ITEM 1
The spatial extent of the study area will be all land contained within a 200 meter outside perimeter buffer in the study area.  This study area includes the watersheds of: Johnson Creek; Big Elk Creek, Middle Big Elk Creek; Feagles Creek; Rail Creek; Cougar Creek; Beaver Dam Creek; Baker Creek; and Sugarbowl Creek of the Coastal Range of Oregon.

All remotelysensed data shall be acquired between October 15th and November 20th, 2005. The exact data acquisition dates within the specified period will be agreed upon, prior to the data acquisition mission, by the Forest Service (FS) and the contractor, based on forest senescence seasonality and weather.

The Contractor will: 
	Obtain LiDAR data for the study area using an Optech 3100 instrument

Specifications of LiDAR data:
	Return Density:	Minimum of 4 per square meter
	Mean beam spacing:	Maximum of 0.50 meters both along and cross track
	Beam divergence:	0.3mRad 
	Flight swath sidelap:	50%

Deliverables:
All final products shall be delivered on portable hard drive(s) with USB-2 connectivity.  All digital data and the portable hard drives will become property of the FS.  All digital data shall be in ASCII or Arc/INFO grid or coverage format in the projection parameters stated below.  All coordinate, LiDAR return intensity, and DEM values shall have a minimum of two-digit precision.

All spatial data shall be in Arc/INFO coverage or GRID format with the following projection parameters:
	Projection: 	UTM
	Datum:	NAD27
	Units:	Meters
	Zone:	10

All X, Y coordinate data shall be in the above described UTM projection.

1) LiDAR data in one ASCII file containing the following information:
-	Unique ID identifier
-	X, Y, and Z coordinates (in UTM zone 10 projection parameters)
-	Return beam intensity
-	Return beam identifier (1-4 with ground return always designated as 4)
-	Forward scan angle
-	Side scan angle

2) Orthorectified Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in Arc/INFO grid format with cell size equal to the resolution of the coarser multispectral data set (0.8  1.0 meter), generated by processing LiDAR ground returns, and using value cells only for the portion of the area where such returns are available.
3) Orthorectified Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in Arc/INFO grid format with cell size equal to the resolution of the coarser multispectral data set (0.8  1.0 meter) resulting from processing Deliverable #2 to obtain interpolated values for cells without ground LIDAR returns.
4) Orthorectified Vegetation surface model (VSM) (similar to a DEM except the surface is the vegetation canopy, not the earths surface), of equal cell size to Deliverable #2 and #3 above, and co-registered with the DEMs generated in Deliverable #2 and #3 above resulting from processing the LiDAR first returns.  (NOTE: This will allow the FS to create a vegetation height data layer for the study area by subtracting the values in Deliverable #3 from Deliverable #4)
5) Arc/INFO coverage containing the flight lines used to obtain the LiDAR data.


 ITEM 2 
Overview: 
Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data acquisition is proposed for a ~42,591 acre area of the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest near Ashland, OR. The objective of the project is to map forest and vegetation stand structure in the forest and to provide an accurate ground model.  To be compatible with previous data collected, the contractor is required to use the Optech 3100 LiDAR system, which is capable of high laser pulse repetition rates (33 to 100k Hz), resulting in sub-meter ground spot spacing. Dense spot spacing provides better penetration of vegetation and detailed mapping of terrain topography. In addition, the system records four range measurements per pulse (first, second, third, and last), allowing for the differentiation of forest canopy from the bare ground, understory and vegetation density derivation. The LiDAR system is integrated with a high resolution Applanix DSS digital camera that can be filtered for either true color or near infrared images. Details of the instrumentation are included in Attachment A. 
Data Collection: 
Flight plans are optimized to cover the entire project area. In forestry applications, the goal is to maintain a scan angle of no more than 15o from nadir. The narrow scan angle minimizes laser shadowing from vegetation and increases the probability of ground returns. 
Figure 1 illustrates the target LiDAR area with proposed flight lines for average ground spot spacing of 74 cm. The system has both wide (0.3 mR) and narrow (0.7 mR) beam divergences settings. The narrow beam divergence is recommended in mountainous terrain with heavy canopy. Cost estimates are provided for different point densities in the table below. 
Schedule: 
The flight will take place during leaf-on conditions. If photos are requested, the optimum flight window is mid-June to late July, 2006 due to higher sun angles.

Standard Deliverables: One-meter digital elevation model (DEM). 
Geocorrected data for all un-gridded return signals. 
Surface intensity image. 
Survey report that includes all LiDAR mission parameters 
Specifications: Beam Divergence = 0.3 mR (Narrow) or 0.7 mR (Wide) 
Scan Angle less than 15o off nadir 
Side Overlap: ~50% 
Average Point Density: 3.2 points/meter squared 
Sensor: Digital True Color or Near Infrared Digital Photos (Optional) 
Standard Deliverables: GIS compatible Orthorectified digital air-photos. 
Specifications: Spatial resolution: <= 30 cm. 
Spectral: True Color: (blue, green, red) OR

Notes: 
 The average point density considers the side overlap between flight lines. 
 Experience has shown that using 50% overlap between flight lines significantly reduces laser shadowing in forested environments. 
 
________________________________________________________________________
Attachment A - INSTRUMENTATION 
The Optech 3100 LiDAR system is comprised of a sensor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). LiDAR data can be collected with a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of up to 100kHz (i.e., 100,000 laser pulses per second), with lower PRF settings spanning 33-71kHz. The inertial measurement unit includes a GPS receiver that streams data from the IMU, stored independently during the flight (and differentially corrected and integrated with LiDAR pulse data during post processing). The data collection system can record all returns at the highest PRF(s) with no truncation errors (i.e. full throughput). The LIDAR system is mounted in the belly of the airplane and calibrated per manufacturers specification, and is also independently tested by the Contractor for internal consistency. 
The system records four range measurements per pulse (first, second, third, and last), allowing for differentiation of forest canopy from the bare ground, understory and vegetation density derivation. Return intensities are also recorded, which allows for the creation of a surface intensity image (also known as a combined elevation model ~ CEM). The intensity image provides a measurement of the surface reflectivity. In forestry applications, return intensities are often used to differentiate between hardwoods, conifers, snags, diseased/dying trees, etc. 

Figure A-1  Raw LiDAR Return Points. 
During the flight, the pilots use a heads-up navigation display to accurately track and maintain each flight line. The sensor operator monitors the data collection on a graphical display that paints the ground with real-time swath (coverage) and range (altitude above ground) as the LiDAR points are acquired. The instrumentation and in-flight procedures ensure that the study area is covered with no discontinuities or gaps.  
_______________________________________________________________________
The LiDAR system is fully integrated with an Applanix DSS Model 301 digital multi-spectral camera with a 16 mega-pixel detector array. The camera is housed in the aircraft sensor bay on a stabilized mount that is designed to hold geometric accuracy in operational environments to within one pixel. The integration of the two sensors with the same GPS/IMU is specifically designed for seamless image registration to the LiDAR data. The camera has a field of view of 37o and has a single Bayer detector array, so band registration errors are not applicable. 
The camera stores imagery in three bands that can be filtered to present either color (visible band) or near infrared (color infrared) imagery (Figure A-2). Band centers for the color infrared images are 555nm (green), 660nm (red), and 820 nm (near infrared). The images are stored in a native 12-bit format and the full radiometric resolution can be maintained through the ortho-rectification process.

Ground Support/Quality Control 
During acquisition, a minimum of two dual frequency DGPS base stations recording at 1second epochs will be utilized. These stations will be established on control points surveyed to CORS96 or HARN datum within or near the project area. Maximum baseline lengths between control points and airborne GPS will not exceed 30 kilometers (18 miles). 
Quality control data will be collected within the project area using a ground-based real-time kinematic survey, also linked to the DGPS base stations and collected with rovers. The rover units receive real-time position corrections from the base stations and can efficiently collect any number of ground control points within the project area (300 or more points surveyed across multiple flight lines). Quality control data are then compared to the processed LiDAR data to ensure minimum accuracies across the project area during post processing, and will be reported with metadata. An absolute RMSE will be calculated for the entire study.

To:  All Small Business Potential Offerors

Subject:  TIRNO-07-R-00011 - Amendment 2 

Reference:  Synopsis/Solicitation number TIRNO-07-R-00011 ? Kiosk Machine Leasing


The purpose of this document is to amend reference synopsis/solicitation. Part I represents questions and answers to potential offeror concerns.  Part II represents language that is deleted and/or added.

Please note the following:
1)  The closing date and time have been extended ? Part II see changes below.

2)  In accordance with FAR Part 52.212-1(k), offerors must be currently registered in the Central Contractor Registration system in order to receive a government award.  Go to www.ccr.gov or call 1-888-227-2423 for more information.


Part I: - Below are IRS? answers to timely received industry questions. 

Question 9:	We want to clarify the timeline expectations for the development phase of the project. Because the application will require custom development we anticipate a development time of 10 weeks. During this period of time, [our company] will meet with the Internal Revenue Services? project team to finalize the business processes. We will design and build the User Interface and reporting documentation. These applications will then go through a process of Quality Assurance and Testing.

Answer 9:  	See Part II, Section II changes below below.  


Question 10:	Section (e) Performance Work Statement, #2 Performance Work Statement (page 8). 
The fourth paragraph requires that every morning the kiosk have at least 75% of the total amount of receipt paper and money order paper available. It also states, that the kiosk machine has no more than 25% of the total capacity of money in the currency acceptor.

We will be unable to comply with this requirement during the initial phase due to the potentially wide variance in payment volumes and the unknown issues of payment amounts and the corresponding bill count.  [Our company] proposes that we address the issue of service level availability in Attachment A ? Performance Matrix.  It is our expectation to maintain the kiosks at an uptime rate of 98% or greater. The Deduction Schedule lists a variety of schedule levels with associated penalties for non-compliance. 

[The company] understands the need for and is committed to delivering the highest level of service possible to the Internal Revenue Service. Presently, our service levels expectations are very similar to those specified. However, due to the uncertain nature and potential variability of the initial phase of the Base Year of May 2007-September 30, 2007, we will request the financial penalties be suspended. It is our goal to work closely with the Internal Revenue Service in delivering a solid program and to track closely to the performance matrix. But, based upon our past experience with other self-service projects, we anticipate there will be modifications to the project that may impact the service levels.

Answer 10:	In accordance with FAR Part 37.601(b), the government must have measurable performance standards and a methodology of assessing those standards.  Therefore, IRS is unable to remove the performance standards. 

	With respect to the ?unknown issues of payment amounts and the corresponding bill count?, see Amendment 1 to this synopsis/solicitation for more information on IRS? estimated cash transactions.

Question 11:	Section (e) Performance Work Statement, #3 Product Specification (page 8).
The seventh line item requires the kiosk ?Be handicap accessible; ADA compliant and Section 508 compliant.? 

Our kiosks will be in compliance with the physical access specifications as described. However, during the initial phase of the Base Year of May 2007-September 30, 2007, we will not be able to comply with the audio access specifications for the visually impaired. It is our intent to develop the audio portion as quickly as possible but, we want you to be aware that we will not be able to deliver the initial kiosks with this feature. 

Answer 11:	The ADA does not require that these machines have audio capability.  More specifically, the discussion relative to auditory output at 1194.25 does not require audio capability it even though it gives guidance for when it is used.


Question 12:	Section (e) Performance Work Statement, #4 Kiosk Locations (page 8-9).
The fourth sentence states ?The contractor shall ensure to have each kiosk machine delivered and operational at the specified location within two weeks of notice.?

We request the delivery date be changed to ?within four weeks of notice?. In addition, we will request the notification form contain installation information such as power and telephone line access, accessibility information such loading dock information and hours of availability.

Answer 12:	See Part II, Section II below. 

 
Question 13:	I found the solicitation on FBO and also pulled it up from the IRS procurement website.  In doing a quick read through it appears some documentation (company name, POC, etc) was due yesterday by 11:00 am if we were interested in responding.  If we did not submit that, are we still qualified to respond to the RFP?

Question 13:	The closing date and time for receipt of your submission has been extended.  See Part II, Section IV below.


Part II:
1)  In Section I ? Supplies or Services and Prices

A)	ADD the following description to CLIN 0001, Kiosk Machine Leasing:

B)	ADD the following description to CLIN 0004, Kiosk Machine Leasing:
?The estimated total price represents the price of leasing ten kiosk machines and is calculated as follows:  Unit Price x Estimated Quantity x 10 machines.?

2)  In Section II ? Contract Terms and Conditions make the following changes

2) Optional Machines ? the contractor shall provide eight kiosk machines to the locations identified in Attachment B ? Kiosk Locations/Security Status, Optional Kiosk Locations and in accordance with the pricing set forth in Section I ? Supplies or Services and Prices.?
