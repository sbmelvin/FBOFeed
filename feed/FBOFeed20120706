<DESC>The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) intends to issue a Request for Proposals for Automated Litigation Support services for the Department. Automated litigation support encompasses a wide range of professional services and products that help attorneys acquire, organize, develop, and present evidence throughout the course of litigation, from pre-filing investigation, through complaint, discovery, and trial, through post-trial briefs and the appeals process. Contractor personnel will furnish administrative, logistical, professional, and technical labor, supplies, equipment, facilities, materials, and technologies necessary to provide a wide range of professional services and products through the course of litigation. The types of litigation support required under this contract will generally fall into the following areas: (1) Document acquisition; (2) Database creation; (3) Database utilization; (4) Electronic data acquisition and production; (5) Pre-trial and trial support; (6) Resource planning, implementation, and administration; (7) Specialized professional services; (8) Contract and project management; and (9) Legal support. DOJ currently has litigation support programs in seven of its litigating components - Civil Division, Antitrust Division, Civil Rights Division, Criminal Division, Environment and Natural Resources Division, Tax Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys. All seven existing programs consist of Government specialists who define case-specific or investigation-specific requirements and then manage contractor-provided case support using contracts designed for automated litigation support. All seven programs are presently making use of our "Mega 3" automated litigation support contracts awarded in May, 2007, for this purpose. As many as five (5) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts are anticipated for this requirement. The Government anticipates a base period of twelve months for each resultant contract with five additional option periods of one year each for a total period of performance of seventy-two (72) months. The solicitation will be available on or about August 08, 2012. Due date for receipt of proposals will be approximately forty (40) days after issuance of the solicitation. All information regarding this procurement, including the solicitation document and amendments, will only be made available electronically on the General Service Administration's "Federal Business Opportunities" web site, http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Hard copies of the solicitation itself will not be available. Interested parties should periodically check this Internet site for information regarding the schedule and this acquisition.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE<br />The National Institute on Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, has a requirement to obtain and analyze data about urologic diseases in America. The burden of urologic diseases on the American public is immense in both human and financial terms, and it remains largely unquantified. Urologic diseases encompass a wide scope of illnesses of the genitourinary tract, including conditions that are congenital and acquired, malignant and benign, male and female, medical and surgical. They can occur at any point in the course of human development, from pre-natal hydronephrosis in utero to incontinence in the elderly. They may be acute and self-limited or chronic and debilitating, may primarily affect quality or quantity of life, and may be financially insignificant or catastrophic. Various government and non-government agencies in the United States maintain a patchwork of population-based studies, observational cohorts, national interview surveys, reviews of physician practice patterns, hospital system databases, regional cancer registries, state health department health information systems, and federal, state, and private insurance claims-based data sets that can provide useful health statistics. These sources contain a wealth of epidemiologic and health services information about health care costs, access, and quality, as well as trends in the diagnosis and management of urologic diseases; however, these information sources have remained largely untapped. The NIDDK initiated the Urologic Diseases in America (UDA) project to delineate the changes in the epidemiology, health economic impact, and practice patterns for the diseases currently included within the scope of practice of the specialty of urology, analyzed retrospectively over a ten-year period. The UDA Compendium consists of data tables annotated in chapters that amplify the data analyses.<br /><br />
<p>The scope of the project shall include: a comprehensive assessment of previous UDA accomplishments and unmet needs; identification of databases available for data acquisition, assessment of available data bases for adequacy to complete the project, and data collection and data interpretation for all benign urologic diseases which fall within the scope of practice of the urologist including, but not limited to, diseases of the prostate (including prostatitis and lower urinary tract symptoms), urolithiasis, urinary tract infections, bladder dysfunctions (including interstitial cystitis, painful bladder symptoms, pediatric urology, infertility and male reproduction), and sexual dysfunction (including erectile dysfunction). In addition, the contractor shall specify the areas for which there is not adequate or reliable data for evaluation, and/or the limitations inherent in the evaluation. Data bases to be accessed may be from federal, state and local governments, health care provider organizations, and industry. Secondary data collected shall be from the most current data files available. Data shall be analyzed from the most current data sets available and retrospectively for a ten-year period (when possible).</p>
<p>The tasks to be performed are to: identify, assess, collect, analyze, verify and collate current data on all benign urologic diseases; develop a set of procedures to facilitate periodic updates of the data for subsequent years; establish a mechanism for data accessibility for future designated special studies and projects; establish a mechanism whereby interested persons can apply for and receive data analyses and writing assistance for specific projects; and prepare the data analyses in a format acceptable for incorporation into narrative chapters designed for dissemination to both health care professionals and patient oriented audiences. Also, the contractor shall arrange, in consultation with the NIDDK, two information dissemination and analysis workshops, and shall publish one update of the UDA Compendium.</p>
<p>A cost-reimbursement type contract using NAICS code 541712 -- Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), is contemplated. NLM intends to award a five year contract beginning on or about July 1, 2012. FAR Part 15 procedures will be used to compete this procurement with full and open competition. The Request for Proposals is expected to be released on or about December 15, 2011 at the FedBizOpps website.</p>

<DESC><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Life Technologies, 2130 Woodward Street, Austin, Texas, 78744 for the purchase of one (1) Silencer Select Human Genome siRNA Library, V4, 384 -Well and one (1) Silencer Select Human Kinase siRNA Library V4, 384-Well.<br /><br />Background:<br /><br />The National Institutes of Health has established an RNAi facility to provide intramural researchers with access to the equipment and expertise necessary to conduct genome-wide RNAi screens in mammalian cells. This facility works as a collaborative resource for doing RNAi assay development, screening, and initial follow up. Our facility works with investigators to develop and optimize their assays for screening, conduct the screens and related informatics analyses, then perform follow-up screens on promising leads.<br />Ambion Silencer Select siRNAs are used for the gene specific knockdown of mRNA transcripts in cells. This library has 3 independent siRNAs per gene arrayed in individual wells of 384 well plates. This item is needed to facilitate our RNAi screening program. This program conducts genome-wide siRNA screens in collaboration with NIH intramural investigators. This work includes RNAi assay development, screening, and initial follow up. The Ambion siRNA library will be used for genome-wide siRNA screens in human cells.
<p>Sole Source Justification:</p>
<p><br />The standard offering of this library is a "pooled" format, which is not in line with NCATS general, more robust screening strategy of using one siRNA per well. Furthermore, NCATS has already optimized protocols for a number of our on-going studies using Ambion Silencer Select siRNAs and they have proven to be reliable reagents. NCATS will easily be able to extend these optimized conditions to genome-wide screening without expensive and laborious re-optimization. NCATS has also generated significant amount of data with the Ambion Silencer Select siRNAs which will be readily integrated with data generated from this genome-wide library. <br /><br />These requested siRNAs are the next generation Ambion siRNAs. These siRNAs incorporate the latest improvements in siRNA design, off-target effect prediction algorithms, and chemical modifications to yield siRNAs with unmatched efficacy, potency, and specificity. In siRNA screening applications, the result obtained is fewer false negatives due to poor silencing and fewer false positives due to off-target effects. In other words, with these siRNAs NCATS will get cleaner, more consistent data from our primary screen, so NCATS will expend less time and resources to find true, validated targets.<br />Because of their importance in cell signaling and many biological pathways, kinases are key drug targets and subjects of intense scrutiny. The included Human Kinase siRNA Library V4 targets 710 human kinases with three individual per gene. This siRNA library enables systematic, yet cost effective, RNAi studies of these key cell regulators. Validated siRNAs are included where available. The included Human Kinase siRNA Library V4 is provided also provided in 384 well plates and will be employed in pilot screens prior to large-scale genome-wide efforts.<br /><br />These requested libraries contain 0.25 nmol of each siRNA, sufficient for 500 transfections (at 5 nM siRNA, 100 &micro;l transfection volume). The siRNAs will be supplied dried into the wells of 384-well plates. The libraries are delivered with full siRNA sequence information, as well as the exon targeted and each targeted gene's symbol, full name, aliases, RefSeq number, and Entrez Gene ID, plus results from any validation experiments done using the included siRNAs.<br />&nbsp;<br />Deliverables:<br />Catalog #, Quantity, Description, Size<br /><br />4397926,1, Silencer Select Human Genome siRNA Library, V4,384 -Well, 0.25 nmol<br /><br />4397918, 1, Silencer Select Human Kinase siRNA Library V4, 384-Well, 0.25 nmol</p>

<DESC><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Nanostring Technologies INC., 530 Fairview Ave N STE 2000, Seattle, Washington 98109-5576 for the preparation of a set of 459 customized molecular probes for the N-counter system. <br /><br />Background:<br /><br />NHGRI will acquire a set of molecular probes for the Nanostring N-counter system, which will allow for the simultaneous measurement of gene expression for 459 RNAs encoding transcription factors. NHGRI will use this set of molecular probes to establish a high-resolution expression timeline for the complete set of transcription factors expressed during the blastula stage of zebrafish development. <br /><br />This information will ultimately help researchers identify and treat the causes of birth defects in humans and animals of economic importance in the following way. First, such an expression timeline will enable the international community of zebrafish developmental biologists to select comprehensive co-expressed sets of transcription factors and go on to de-code the gene regulatory networks of transcription factors that determine the zebrafish body plan. Second, because gene regulatory networks in zebrafish are highly conserved in related vertebrate organisms, this information will illuminate our understanding of how gene regulatory network dysfunction leads to birth defects in humans and the vertebrate animals upon which we depend (i.e., livestock and food fish). <br /><br />Sole Source Justification:<br /><br />This is a very new technology that enables the direct measurement of RNA levels without any steps of molecular cloning or artificial amplification. The continued use of this vendor by NCATS is imperative to studies that are currently in progress. NCATS has invested substantial time and effort in perfecting the use of this particular technology and with working with the current vendor. Switching technology during this pilot study stage, even if it were available, would be counterproductive and costly to the Government.
<p>Statement of Work:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall prepare a set of 459 customized molecular probes for use on the N-counter system. The contractor shalll design and manufacture a custom set of 459 probes to be used with the Nanostring reader system, which the NIH already has in the NCI DNA minicore. The 459 probes are specific to 459 zebrafish RNAs encoding a corresponding 459 transcription factor proteins. A sufficient quantity of each probe shall be provided to allow n NHGRI to perform 48 independent measurements. The production time for these 459 will be between 4 to 8 weeks.</p>
<p>Government responsibilities:</p>
<p>Through these 48 measurements, NHGRIwill determine a detailed timeline for the expression RNAs encoding each of these 459 transcription factors, which will be an immense step forward for Dr. Feldman and other developmental biologists in efforts to de-code the transcriptional regulatory processes that control early vertebrate development and patterning."</p>
<p>Period of Performance: 4-8 weeks after award date.</p>

Dwight Bergles, Ph.D., Director, Multiphoton Imaging Core, has developed the mice with this unique trait and is the only source that currently possesses them or has access to them. <br /><br />Detecting chemical changes, selectively expressed in astrocytes in mice via new genetically encoded indicators, can potentially enhance knowledge about physiological and pathological significance of astrocytes signaling. Astrocytes express receptors in most, if not all, neurotransmitters, by influencing neuronal activity by releasing neuroactive substances. Yet, their participation in drug induced changes in neural circuits is unknown. This project will investigate the role that astrocytes have in modulating neuronal responses to psychostimulants, such as cocaine. Research of exposure to psychostimulants suggests that recidivistic behaviors may arise from inappropriate modulation of pathways that enable normal learning. Understanding the many sequelae induced by psychostimulant exposure, and identification of new therapeutic targets for suppressing compulsive behaviors, remain central goals of addiction research.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 5 Network Contracting Office anticipates issuing a solicitation for a contractor-operated Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in accordance with FAR part 12 & 15 and 38 USC 8153.  A single award IDIQ contract with a base year and 4 option years is contemplated.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 621498 with a size standard of $10.0 million (USD).  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or about May 1, 2012.  Proposals will be due 30 days after issuance of the solicitation. This notice is for informational purposes only and is not a request for proposals. The Government is not obligated to issue a solicitation as a result of this notice.

The clinic must be located within a 5 mile radius of the current clinic location (847 Cantrell Ave, Suite 100; Harrisonburg, VA).  It is anticipated that in its first year of operation, the Harrisonburg CBOC will have approximately 3,545 veteran enrollees.  Payments under the contemplated contract would be made on a capitated-rate basis.  The company awarded the contract will be required to have a fully operation clinic up and running on or before the 90th day after award.  

Contractor set-up activities include, but are not limited to: 
1) leasing adequate space
2) furnishing the space with adequate office furniture
3) equipping the space with adequate office, computer and medical equipment
4) providing physicians and other health care providers with the requisite licenses, credentials, certifications, etc.
5) working with the VA to connect to the VA computer network
6) ensuring that the clinic will be compliant with all relevant VA and JCAHO regulations from the first day of operation

Operational activities include, but are not limited to, handling all operational activities of a primary care and mental health clinic, and using the VA Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) to enter all information related to patient care.  The contractor would provide primary care and mental health services in a clinic environment, solely to veterans who primarily reside in Rockingham, Albemarle, Augusta and Greene counties of Virginia, and Harrisonburg City, VA.   

The contractor operated CBOC must have the necessary facilities, professional medical staff, diagnostic testing and treatment capability, and referral arrangements needed to ensure continuity of health care.  Primary Care services include longitudinal outpatient medical care for the purposes of prevention and detection of disease and subsequent management of medical conditions, for veterans deemed eligible.  The contractor will also be responsible for documenting care provided using CPRS.  The care will be provided by primary care providers who must be either family practitioners or general internists or their authorized designees.  Furthermore, the physician providers must be Board Certified/Board Eligible and licensed to practice in the state of Virginia.  The proposed CBOC, at a minimum, shall provide one standard of care that must be consistent, safe and of high quality.  Additionally, the proposed CBOC is expected to comply with all relevant VA policies and procedures, including those related to quality, patient safety and performance.  The care provided by the CBOC should be patient centered, continuous, accessible, coordinated, and consistent with VA Medical Center standards, including the thirteen service standards detailed in VHA Directive 2006-041, "Veterans Health Care Service Standards," dated 6/27/06 (http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=1443).  Finally, the VA Office of Patient Care Services, Primary Care Program Office, is undertaking a new initiative to implement a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model at all Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Primary Care sites which is referred to as Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT).  This initiative supports the VHA Universal Health Care Services Plan to redesign VHA healthcare delivery through increasing access, coordination, communication, and continuity of care.  PACT provides accessible, coordinated, comprehensive, patient-centered care, and is managed by primary care providers with the active involvement of other clinical and non-clinical staff.  PACT allows patients to have a more active role in their health care and is associated with increased quality improvement, patient satisfaction, and a decrease in hospital costs due to fewer hospital visits and readmissions.  Additional information on PACT can be found here: http://www.va.gov/primarycare/pcmh/).

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br />&nbsp;
<p>This small business notice was previously issued under HHS-NIH-NIDA(MH)-12-265, was cancelled to change/correct the tracking number, and is hereby reissued with a revised/extended due date.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) the classification/ type of small business (e.g., whether they are small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, HubZone small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small business, economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) or women-owned small business (WOSB)) and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. Teaming and partnering arrangements among small businesses is encouraged.</p>
<p>Any business responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the business's qualifications to perform the work.</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND<br />The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health, seek to establish mechanisms to make human brain tissue and biospecimen samples more widely available for research on neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p>In order to do so, the NIH intends to establish multiple contract collection sites (i.e., the "Neurobiobank") to provide services that will actively acquire, receive, store, catalog, preserve, and distribute specimens (including fetal tissues) to qualified investigators. These services were previously provided through grants which have expired and/or will be expiring in the coming years. The NIH will now continue these services through competitively awarded contracts.</p>
<p>B. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br />The purpose of this acquisition is to provide services which make human tissue (including fetal) more widely available for research. The NIH intends to establish multiple awardees/collection sites in order to provide sufficient critical resources for research on neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The objective is to award to sites that can acquire at least 100 donors per year (but at a minimum, at least 300 unique human donors by the end of the five-year contract period).</p>
<p>C. PROJECT REQUIREMENTS<br />Qualified sources will be required to acquire specimens, document and maintain a current inventory by entering data on the donors and tissue samples into to a third party interactive web site (508c compliant) herein referred to as the NIH Neurobiobank Portal and participate in the sharing of tissue(s) and associated data under the guidelines set forth in the Statement of Work. The NIH Neurobiobank Portal will serve the critical purpose of requesting access to tissues and coordinating the distribution from the various brain banks to qualified scientific investigators who are dedicated to the improved understanding, care and treatment of these disorders (see http://www.nimh.nih.gov/; http://www.ninds.nih.gov/; and http://www.nichd.nih.gov/ for areas of disease focus). Various types of deliverables will be required including a collection of brain tissue and biospecimens, data, and reports. The anticipated contracts will include Standard Operating Procedures {SOPs) and protocols to ensure uniformity among sites when possible, and Quality Assurance/Quality Control requirements for prospective evaluation of short and long term specimen integrity, viability and function.</p>
<p>Qualified sources should have the ability to provide:</p>
<p>1. Infrastructure to actively acquire, receive, store, catalog, preserve, and distribute brain tissue and biospecimens to qualified investigators. Tissue shall be collected in accordance with all applicable state and local laws and Federal regulations. Tissue acquired will be focused on the postmortem brain, other nervous system tissues from individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, neurological disorders, and neuropsychiatric disorders and controls. Other tissues, pre-mortem biopsies, and prenatal material will also be a valuable component and will be collected on an ad hoc basis.</p>
<p>2. Data collection utilizing standard forms (with web-based entry and searchable data collation) and compatible computerized databases, the Contractor shall report data and an accurate index of their Brain Bank inventory to the NIH Neurobiobank Portal, a third party interactive web site (508c compliant), on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>3. Sufficient capacity to store and maintain biologic specimens derived from 300-500 unique human donors by the end of the five-year contract period (multiple specimens may come from any given individual). This includes sufficient ultra- freezers and additional storage and processing capacity should be available for non-frozen material including fixed tissues. Provide a climate-controlled facility with the capacity to maintain room temperatures such that freezers can function normally when all equipment is operating, with sufficient back up power to maintain normal operation in a power failure. Provide enough back-up freezer space to accommodate the failure of at least one freezer. Complete transfer of the contents of a freezer shall occur within 2 hours of an initial freezer failure. Provide adequate, on-site back-up power to handle complete electrical power failure.</p>
<p>4. Established mechanisms for registering potential donors for the Neurobiobank and outreach to appropriate disease advocacy organizations.</p>
<p>5. Option<br />The Government intends to include options for additional services which may include:</p>
<p>Option 1: Enhancement of tissue processing for highly sought tissues: Neuropathological examination of all specimens to characterize the status of the donated tissue using industry standard methods and techniques.</p>
<p>D. OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>1. Protocols and standards at a minimum should meet those set forth in the NCI Best Practices for Biospecimen Resources (http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/globallpdfs/NCI_Best_Practices_060507.pdf) established by the Office of Biorepository and Biospecimen Research.</p>
<p>2. 508 compliance is applicable for all systems housing data</p>
<p>3. Compliance with NIH/OHRP guidelines and 45CFR Part 46, to ensure that the Bank has undergone annual review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB)</p>
<p>4. Information Technology (IT) Security that is compliant with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) to ensure security of all data generated over the life of the contract.</p>
<p>5. Appropriate shipping licenses and permits from local, State, Federal and International authorities for the safe import, storage and distribution of biological specimens, according to current regulatory guidelines, will be required, as applicable.</p>
<p>6. Procedures and protocols for safe handling of potentially hazardous and infectious materials will be required.</p>
<p>E. ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />June 2013- May 2015 (with yearly options to extend term of the contract through May 2023)</p>
<p>F. CAPABILITY STATEMENT /INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />Capability statements should clearly state/describe your ability, experience, and resources to design and carry out the services outlined herein, including:</p>
<p>1. Information on capability to perform the Project Requirements above including infrastructure, data collection, etc., the Option, and also addressing the Other Important Considerations.</p>
<p>2. Staff expertise that would be working on this project, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training</p>
<p>3. Prior completed projects of similar nature</p>

<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC>This is a sources sought notice for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations, National Marine Fisheries located in Panama City, FL who is seeking to purchase a Micromill machine (Model 1000-3016) for processing biological samples from Electro Scientific Industries (ESI), Inc.
<p>This item is a high-resolution micro sampling instrument and is required to allow for milling and/or drilling powder for biological samples for chemical and isotopic analyses. Samples can be removed as whole core<br />or as powder. Whole cores are approximately 1 mm thick x 1 &frac12; mm wide and 3 mm ling. To mill samples to this precision requires a computer-driven piece of equipment. The micromill is computer controlled machine that allows for specific design of milling patterns that need to be milled from the sample. Most micromills operate in only two dimension (X,Y) but this particular machine operates in three dimension (X,Y, and Z). As a computer controlled device, precise movements for depth, scan speed, and drill bit speed are available and these precise measurements are critical to the government's need. The material must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit, and function) with existing systems presently installed and utilized since 2005. During this time, standard operating procedures as well as designed species-specific patterns to mill whole cores and/or powder rom biological samples have been implemented. Currently, there are several collaborative projects already in progress using this exact piece of equipment. To ensure project continuity and to insure data integrity, using the identical piece of equipment is required.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) on behalf of the Program Executive Office, Littoral Combat Ships (PEO LCS) is providing technical data for the AN/AES-1 Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS). The purpose is to increase industry collaboration with the PEO LCS, Mine Warfare Program Office PMS495. 

The Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) is a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) high area coverage system that detects, classifies, and localizes surface and near-surface moored sea mines. The system is deployed from the MH-60S helicopter and will provide organic airborne mine detection to the battle force.

The government is soliciting a request for information for mine classification algorithms.
  Data training sets are provided for feature extraction and classification development.  A government controlled performance test may be requested where the probability of detection (Pd) and probability of false alarm (Pfa) can be demonstrated against a Test Contact Data Set.  The probability of detection against the Test Contact Data Set is desired to be 95% for mines as mines.

The Government is providing the following Technical Data:
1)	Interface Design Documents (IDDs)
2)	Training Contact Data Sets, with truth information, containing
o	Mine Mine-like Contacts
o	Non-Mine Non-Mine-Like Contacts
o	Non-Mine Mine-like Contacts
3)	Test Contact Data Sets

In order for prospective contractors to receive technical data they must be a US Citizen or Permanent Resident Alien and complete the Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) (Attachment 1).
 

The information the government is requesting includes the following:
1)	Classifier Performance on Training Contact Data Sets 
o	Performance parameters
	Of the total number of 1) Mine Mine-like Contacts, 2) Non-Mine Non-Mine-Like Contacts, and 3) Non-Mine Mine-like Contacts
	% Classified as Mines
	% Classified as Non-Mine Mine-Like, 
	% Classified as Non-Mine-Like
o	Results of performance may be binned by the follow parameters
	Set
	Depth
	Camera
	System Attenuation Coefficient (Ksys)
	Specularity
2)	Description of Features and Classifiers Used, similarly described
3)	Future Work and Potential Performance Improvements
4)	Estimate of Contact Processing Rate when optimized and basis of estimate
5)	Executable code and operating instructions

After the Contractor responds to the RFI and successfully completes the NDA, the Government may provide the system IDDs and Training Data Sets.
  After the Contractor provides the information requested above, the Government may request further demonstration against a Test Contact Data Set.  The Government may score submittals containing an executable against the test set and the results may be released to the Contractor.  The Government may still consider submittals not containing executable code, but such submittals will need to be coordinated with the Government.

Contractors interested in receiving technical data shall submit their request along with their NDA, include a point of contact or name of authorized representative, and phone number electronically to amanda.fritsch@navy.mil no later than 06 August 2012.  Telephone responses will not be honored.
 

This announcement is a request for information only. This notice is not a contract, request for proposal, or commitment of any kind. The Government does not commit to providing a response to any comment or questions.  The Government may use the information provided in response to this RFI to support urgent, on-going, initiatives within DoD to analyze emerging requirements for systems that can improve the overall effectiveness of ALMDS.  Any revision to this RFI based on comments received remains solely at the Governments discretion.  These initiatives may ultimately result in the Government developing and issuing a RFP.  NAVSEA provides the above information for information only.  This is not a Request for Proposal or announcement of a solicitation.
  This Request for Information does not constitute a commitment by the Government to issue an RFP, contract or order.  Under FAR Part 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement, nor will the Government return any data provided.  No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of this announcement or for Government use of any information provided.

 If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced later to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) webpage located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the response to this sources sought synopsis.
 Response to this sources sought synopsis is NOT a request to be added to a plan holders list.

<DESC>This Sources Sought/RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry.
 
The Naval Weapons System Support (NAVSUP WSS) and the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FLENUMMETOCCEN) are issuing this combination Sources Sought Notice / Request for Information. The objective of this Sources Sought / RFI notice is to gain information from industry with regard to the technical requirements of the PWS and to facilitate the NAVSUP Contracting Officers review of the market base required for acquisition planning / size determination (unrestricted vs. set-aside or sole source).

This Sources Sought provides an opportunity for respondents to submit their availability and potential to fulfill the Navy requirement related to this request in the form of a capability package.

Currently, most environmental forecasts are created from a single best estimate analysis and forecast model.
 The ensemble-based approach of weather forecasting improves upon deterministic forecast accuracy; reducing costs of defensive and offensive military scenarios impacted by inclement weather; and increases effectiveness of a variety of military applications by adding probabilistic estimates.  For example, a Commander will be given a probability of environmental parameters exceeding operational thresholds versus a point forecast.  This enables the decision making process with more information and more accuracy.  However, DoD customers will accept ensemble products only if the increased accuracy and value of those products can be quantitatively shown through Ensemble Verification and Validation (V&V), which is the purpose of this tasking.

The existing Ensemble V&V system provides basic reports for a standard set of variables as established by the post-processing subcommittee of the NUOPC technology transfer committee.
  This on-demand enhancement will make the system more interactive and expand the verification statistics provided to include Navy-relevant metrics.

All work is to be performed ONSITE, in Monterey, CA. While the vendor does not need to be based in the Monterey area, local personnel are required. Commuting expenses will NOT be paid. Further details are described in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS).

<p><br /><strong>*FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is the primary database for procurement and payment information for contractors who wish to conduct business with the Federal Government. Prospective contractors are required to register in CCR in order to be awarded a contract by the federal government. Contractors are required to complete a one-time registration to provide basic information relevant to procurement and financial transactions. Contractors must update or renew their registration at least once per year to maintain an active status. Additional information regarding CCR can be accessed via www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>Prospective contractors must also complete electronic annual representations and certifications at Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) accessed via orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the CCR database. ORCA replaces most of the paper based Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs) in Section K of a contract with an Internet application.</p>
<p>The FAR mandates the use of CCR and ORCA and prohibits contracting officers from awarding a contract to contractors who are not registered.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Registration in CCR and ORCA does not guarantee that a contract will be awarded to a prospective contractor.</strong></p>

Statement of Capabilities (SOCs), limited to Two (2) pages and shall demonstrate the experience in providing or manufacturing of product or capability to provide products meeting the specifications listed.<br><br>Statement of Capabilities may be submitted to Jean Paul Bretz via email preferably to jean.p.bretz@usace.army.mil or facsimile at (505) 808-4605 Attn: Jean Paul Bretz. Responses must be received no later than 13 July 2012 at 4:00 PM Pacific Standard Time. <br><br><br>DESCRIPTION OF NEED:<br>The Portland District, US Army Corps of Engineers is seeking potential sources to provide Two (2) live haul fish trucks for transporting fish listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  In general, a fish haul truck consists of a fabricated tank mounted on a truck chassis. The trucks shall be identical in order to be interchangeable between fish collection facilities.<br>The fish truck manufacturer will need to have experience with designing fish trucks with pressure vessel rated tanks.  The tank on these trucks differ from typical aquaculture tanks found commonplace in industry.  Custom stainless steel fabrication of a pressure tank with fish friendly interior structural supports that will need to transmit load through the tank and the truck to the ground in order to support the weight of an overhead hopper loaded with fish for a water to water transfer.  A stress free environment for ESA listed fish, operator safety, and public safety is paramount.  The truck itself will need to be highway rated but also capable of off-road travel for delivery of fish in rural lakes and rivers. <br><br>The Two (2) live haul fish trucks shall meet the following specifications:<br><br>MANUFACTURER QUALIFICATIONS<br>The fish haul tanks shall be manufactured by an entity that regularly engages in the fabrication of custom stainless steel tanks used for fish transportation. The fish haul truck (tank and chassis) shall be completely assembled by the tank manufacturer. The tank manufacturer shall submit manufacturer's qualifications that show a past performance of fish haul tank manufacture. The qualifications shall also provide details on at least two previous fish haul trucks, built by the manufacturer, that are similar in size and scope to the fish haul trucks in this contract.<br><br>WARRANTY<br>Provide a 2-year extended warranty that covers all features of the fish haul truck. The warranty period shall start when the Government takes ownership of the equipment.<br><br>PRODUCTS<br><br>FISH HAUL TRUCK<br><br>Safe Transport of Fish<br>The fish haul truck shall have sufficient hauling, carrying capacity, and quality containment attributes for the safe transport of fish. Quality containment attributes include items such as: no sharp corners or edges inside the tank, no small openings in the tank in which fish could get trapped, wedged, or caught, and no barriers inside the tank behind which fish could get caught as water is drained from the tank.<br><br>Opening<br>The fish haul truck shall have an opening on the top of the tank that matches the dimensions needed for the hopper assembly and will allow for the safe transfer of fish from the Collection Facility into the truck tank. The opening on top of the tank shall have a lockable lid that can pivot out of the way when the hopper is lowered onto the tank.<br><br>Water to Water Transfer<br>The fish haul truck tank and transfer system shall be designed to allow "water to water" transfer of fish from the Collection Facility to the truck tank. A water to water transfer establishes a continuous water column from the hopper to the tank immediately after the hopper door is opened. Therefore both the tank and the space between the tank and hopper are completely full of water prior to opening the hopper door. Fish are transferred into the tank by means of draining water from a low point of the tank.<br><br>Clearance<br>The top and highest point of the truck (excluding exhaust pipes) and the opening of the tank shall not exceed 117 inches when the tank is empty or be less than 102 inches when the tank is full of water to allow for proper fastening of the hopper assembly for the transfer of fish and water into the truck tank.<br><br>Fish Discharge<br>The fish haul truck shall have an air operated gate valve located on the bottom of the rear end of the tank that can completely drain the tank when opened.

The Corps intends to make multiple awards of indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts from a single solicitation.  The District needs to establish new contracts to continue research investigations, and respond to litigative issues associated with implementation of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) Endangered Species Act (ESA).  Most of the work conducted under the previous contracts has been focused on the passage of adult and juvenile salmonids, lamprey, and resident fish at hydroelectric projects.  Future work is anticipated to occur throughout the Northwest, including but not limited to the Columbia, Snake, and Willamette Basins, estuaries and near-shore ocean environment, Lake Washington, Puget Sound, and tributaries.<br>	In future years, similar types of research needs are anticipated.  It is important to be aware that the topics, techniques, and scope of biological studies may need to evolve, based on changing priorities identified through regional discussions.  This has been readily accommodated by past Contractors with a broad array of professional experience available within their organization.  Less specifically focused types of biologically-related activities may also be requested.  These may involve the development of study plans, experimental designs, literature reviews, data analysis, or biological assessments.  In addition, studies may be conducted either in a laboratory setting or in the field, at a hydroelectric site or other locations.  The actual volume, type, and location of work to be undertaken during the term of this contract are uncertain.<br><br> Expertise Needed<br>The intent of this Source Sought is to secure a source of high quality expertise for the District to have available on an as-needed basis for biological and ecological-related tasks.  Individual delivery orders (task orders) will be developed by the District and provided to the Contractor as a scope of work, describing the problem and objectives that would need to be addressed in responsive proposals.  Depending on the nature of the work, the scopes of work may be very specific or rather general.  In the latter case, the burden would be on the Contractor to develop methodology and experimental design to address a problem statement, formulate relevant objectives, and provide a methodology to address the objectives.<br>	<br>	A Request for Proposal (RFP) solicits a technical portfolio/proposal that describes how the Contractor would provide needed expertise to the District on an indefinite delivery basis.

Relevant experience would be a project where the company BOTH established and operated a Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) for primary care and mental health services.  Payments under the contemplated contract would be made on a capitated-rate basis.  The company awarded the contract will be required to have a fully operation clinic up and running on or before the 90th day after award.  

Set-up activities include, but are not limited to: 
1) leasing adequate space
2) furnishing the space with adequate office furniture
3) equipping the space with adequate office, computer and medical equipment
4) providing physicians and other health care providers with the requisite licenses, credentials, certifications, etc.
5) working with the VA to connect to the VA computer network
6) ensuring that the clinic will be compliant with all relevant VA and JCAHO regulations from the first day of operation

Operational activities include, but are not limited to, handling all operational activities of a primary care and mental health clinic, and using the VA Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) to enter all information related to patient care.  The contractor would provide primary care and mental health services in a clinic environment, solely to veterans who primarily reside in Rockingham, Albemarle, Augusta and Greene counties of Virginia, and Harrisonburg City, VA.  The new clinic must be located within a 5 mile radius of the current clinic location (847 Cantrell Ave, Suite 100; Harrisonburg, VA).  It is anticipated that in its first year of operation, the Harrisonburg CBOC will have approximately 3,545 veteran enrollees.

The contractor operated CBOC must have the necessary facilities, professional medical staff, diagnostic testing and treatment capability, and referral arrangements needed to ensure continuity of health care.  Primary Care services include longitudinal outpatient medical care for the purposes of prevention and detection of disease and subsequent management of medical conditions, for veterans deemed eligible.  The contractor will also be responsible for documenting care provided using CPRS.  The care will be provided by primary care providers who must be either family practitioners or general internists or their authorized designees.  Furthermore, the physician providers must be Board Certified/Board Eligible and licensed to practice in the state of Virginia.  The proposed CBOC, at a minimum, shall provide one standard of care that must be consistent, safe and of high quality.  Additionally, the proposed CBOC is expected to comply with all relevant VA policies and procedures, including those related to quality, patient safety and performance.  The care provided by the CBOC should be patient centered, continuous, accessible, coordinated, and consistent with VA Medical Center standards, including the thirteen service standards detailed in VHA Directive 2006-041, "Veterans Health Care Service Standards," dated 6/27/06 (http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=1443).  Finally, the VA Office of Patient Care Services, Primary Care Program Office, is undertaking a new initiative to implement a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model at all Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Primary Care sites which is referred to as Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT).  This initiative supports the VHA Universal Health Care Services Plan to redesign VHA healthcare delivery through increasing access, coordination, communication, and continuity of care.  PACT provides accessible, coordinated, comprehensive, patient-centered care, and is managed by primary care providers with the active involvement of other clinical and non-clinical staff.  PACT allows patients to have a more active role in their health care and is associated with increased quality improvement, patient satisfaction, and a decrease in hospital costs due to fewer hospital visits and readmissions.  Additional information on PACT can be found here: http://www.va.gov/primarycare/pcmh/).

Interested parties shall respond no later than close of business on January 19, 2012, and shall provide the following information:

1) Name of business and company contact information
2) DUNS number
3) Description of specific projects where your firm BOTH established and operated a primary care outpatient clinic in the United States.  Only list those projects where your firm handled BOTH the establishment and the operation of the clinic.  List the dates of operation for each project that meets BOTH criteria. 
4) PROVIDE REFERENCES FOR PROJECTS WHERE YOUR FIRM HAS BOTH ESTABLISHED AND OPERATED A PRIMARY CARE CLINIC. 

If a formal solicitation is issued, it is anticipated that the award date of any resultant contract would be on or about June 4, 2012.  The contract period of performance would consist of a one-year base period, and four 1-year option periods.  

NOTE: Key personnel will be listed in the contract. No substitutions of key personnel will be allowed for the first 90 days.  Any substitutions thereafter must be approved in advance by the VA Chief of Staff for the Martinsburg, WV VA Medical Center.

<SUBJECT>Proposed upgrade of non-rechargeable alkaline batteries from C-List (agency specific) to B-List (Broad Government Requirement) on the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the upgrade of  non-rechargeable alkaline batteries currently on the PL from C-List (for the specific requirement of the Department of Defense) to B-List for the Broad Government Requirement.  The batteries currently on the PL are:</p>
<p>NSN:		6135-00-985-7845<br />Name:		Battery, Non-Rechargeable, AA, Alkaline<br />Description:	AA Alkaline non-rechargeable battery. UOI is PG. PG = 24</p>
<p>NSN:		6135-00-826-4798<br />Name:		Battery, Non-Rechargeable, AAA, Alkaline<br />Description:	AAA Alkaline non-rechargeable battery. UOI is PG. PG = 12</p>
<p>NSN:		6135-00-900-2139<br />Name:		Battery, Non-Rechargeable, 9V, Alkaline<br />Description:	9V Alkaline non-rechargeable battery. UOI is PG. PG = 12</p>
<p>NSN:		6135-00-985-7846<br />Name:		Battery, Non-Rechargeable, C, Alkaline<br />Description:	C Alkaline non-rechargeable battery. UOI is PG. PG = 12</p>
<p>NSN:		6135-00-835-7210<br />Name:		Battery, Non-Rechargeable, D, Alkaline<br />Description:	D Alkaline non-rechargeable battery. UOI is PG. PG = 12</p>
<p>The existing contracting activity with government oversight for the Federal Supply Code for these items is the Defense Logistics Agency, Land and Maritime, Columbus, OH.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected  firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>

<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List), or Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than July 20, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>DLA Information Operations at New Cumberland PA (J6N) located at San Diego CA has a requirement for a Contractor to provide IT support services for on-site hardware, software, and technical support for approximately 413 employees to augment existing Government IT support personnel. The objective is to ensure that all IT equipment, to include network servers/hardware, workstations, printers, portable computers, network infrastructure (cabling), and other miscellaneous IT equipment are functioning at all times to support mission requirements. These services are mission essential services. DLA Information Operations does not have the expertise in house to perform these services, so contractual services are required.

<p>In order to ensure that a break in services is not experienced, DLA Information Operations would like to issue a sole source contract to BTSI for a period of three months. This award is a sole source award under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) "Only One Responsible Source/a Limited Number of Responsible Sources and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541513and the size standard is $25,000,000.00.</p>
<p>To receive an award resulting from solicitations issued after May 31, 1998, your company must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Portfolio Management Division (PMD) within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) requires a sole source contract for a highly specialized loan assessment model entitled ?General Manufacturing Scorecard?.
This action is to establish a firm fixed price sole-source modification under existing DOE contract DE-LP0000030 with Standard & Poor's ("S&P") under FAR 6.302-1, One Responsible Source.  The value of the proposed sole source is $105,000.  The purpose of this modification is to obtain specialized credit/risk assessment model based on a comprehensive and extensive project finance database owned by S&P to support the LPO risk management of the DOE loan portfolio.  Portfolio management has new internal rating methodologies to assess risk and calculate Probabilities of Default (PD) and Loss-Given Defaults (LGD) for each transaction in the loan portfolio and the S&P model is uniquely able to provide a tool to perform these calculations.  The period of performance for this contract shall be a period of 13 weeks to tailor the models and provide training on the models with annual updates not to exceed 3 years.
The DOE will require that firms who wish to challenge this proposed sole source must do so in writing by advising the Contract Specialist, Lisa Persson, by email using the address: lisa.persson@hq.doe.gov.  The submission must contain a complete technical and price description of the counter offer by the challenging firm.  The due date for submission is July 20, 2012.  
Please see the attached JOFOC for additional information.

<a href="mailto:cheryl_mockford@fws.gov">cheryl_mockford@fws.gov</a>
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to go Sole Source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to Microwave Telemetry for 10 PTT-100 5 gram solar PTT Burrowing Owl Transmitters. This transmitter unit is specially designed for burrowing owls, with a shorter antenna mounted at a 45 degree off-back angle and a raised solar-panel platform.  Microprocessor controlled battery charging; duty cycle timer; temperature and battery voltage sensors; up to two years operating lifetime; one-year warranty against electronic failure.  Microwave Telemetry has been supplying miniature Platform Transmitter Terminals (PTTs) designed especially for tracking migratory birds with the Argos satellite system since 1991.  In 1994, they converted the electronic module to a hybrid circuit that weighs only 3.5 grams and, along with new batteries, allowed them to produce PTTs that weighed less than 30 grams.  The 5 gram PTT is the smallest satellite tag for tracking birds available anywhere in the world.  The only other US company that makes solar-powered PTT tags is North Star Science and Technology, but the smallest units they make are 9.5 grams.  These tags are too large for use on burrowing owls.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/OAR/ARL/ATDD, plans to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, with Francis Parks to provide site support and maintenance at Smith Island, Maryland. Period of performance is to be:
<p>Base Year: September 14, 2012 - September 13, 2013<br />Option Year 1: September 14, 2013 - September 13, 2014<br />Option Year 2: September 14, 2014 - September 13, 2015</p>
<p>Requirements are as follow:</p>
<p>The Smith Island, Maryland station (37.9925, -76.0345) is one of approximately 250 stations in the National Atmospheric Deposition Program National Trends Network, a joint venture between NOAA, EPA, USDA, USGS, and several other state, federal, and private organizations designed to determine trends in the nation's precipitation chemistry. The Smith Island station was chosen to monitor nitrogen and sulfur deposition directly to the central Chesapeake Bay. Smith Island is one of the very few places where this is possible, and the selection of a site operator was quite difficult given the location of the station and the very few people who still live there. The Smith Island site meets NADP siting guidelines and has operated satisfactorily since it began operation in 1995. Current costs are modest; moving the site or changing the site operator will disrupt a working arrangement that was quite difficult to establish. More importantly, moving the site will destroy continuity of our data record, the most important consideration in a trend determination process. <br />Tasks to be performed<br />The work to be performed by Mr. Francis Parks Jr. at the Smith Island station as part of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network will be to continue monitoring precipitation chemistry on a weekly basis according to the methods specified by the NADP/NTN Central Analytical Laboratory in Champaign, Illinois. This effort requires the following:<br />&bull; Routine (at least weekly) maintenance of Aerochem Metrics precipitation collector and official recording gauge<br />&bull; Collection of all precipitation samples on a weekly basis for the entire year. Follow the weekly Tuesday to Tuesday sample collection schedule and submit samples with a completed Field Observer Report Form (FORF) and raingage chart to the Central Analytical Laboratory (CAL) for analysis.<br />&bull; Packaging and shipping of samples to the Central Analytical Laboratory according to NADP/NTN protocols at least once per week<br />&bull; Site and equipment maintenance as necessary</p>
<p><br />Deliverables<br />The operator shall submit all required documentation and site operations forms, sample collection forms, etc., to NADP and shall maintain an electronic log for maintenance, calibrations, etc. according to Full requirements for site operation are specified in the National Trends Network Site Operation Manual: http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/lib/manuals/opman.pdf<br />Support is to be performed on Tuesdays to stay within NADP operating protocols for NTN sample collection. Otherwise no more than 12 hours per week shall be worked.<br />Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required system. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. A contract will be issued in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This solicitation is a small business set aside. The associated FSC for this is B502 and the associated NAICS Code is 541990.</p>
<p>Offers will be evaluated based on price, proven technical capabilities, and the factors set forth in paragraph (a). An award will be made to the firm who can meet the specific requirements and is most advantageous to the Government considering price and other related factors on an all or none basis. This will be a firm fixed-price purchase order, with payment terms of Net 30.</p>
<p>The offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Aug 2009), with its quote.</p>

<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>

<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.<br />(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:<br />(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.<br />(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.<br />(3) For long-term contracts-<br />(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and<br />(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.<br />(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/ .<br />(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.<br />(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect the Contractor's current status.

<p><strong>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</strong></p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><strong>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br /></strong>Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p><strong>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br /></strong>Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>
<p>EPIC: Required for access to MSC vessels. Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) MSFSC(underscore)EPIC(underscore)EAST@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Adherence to Product Specification <br />ii) Price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract based on the Offeror whose quote, conforming to the specifications named in the Product Specification, will be the lowest price technically acceptable. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Adherence to Product Specification). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY:</p>
<p>FACTOR I. - ADHERENCE TO PRODUCT SPECIFICATION-The Offeror shall submit evidence that acknowledges the features and tasks identified in the Product Specification to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of delivering the required items and performing the work. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the information outlined in the Product Specification.</p>
<p>FACTOR II. - PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price. The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your proposal.</p>
<p>ADJECTIVAL RATINGS:<br />Quotes will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Adherence to Product Specification follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II, Price.</p>
<p>Factor I- Adherence to Product Specification will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:</p>
<p>Acceptable-The proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes strengths which significantly outweigh the weaknesses. The risk of unsuccessful performance is at least moderate, as the proposal solutions are feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are clear and precise, fully supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirement.</p>
<p>Unacceptable- The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has numerous weaknesses which outweigh the strengths. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirement.</p>
<p>Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with your offer.</p>

<p>The full text of all provisions and clauses can be found at www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p>Addenda to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Technical Capabilities<br />ii) Technical Approach<br />iii) Understanding of the Requirement<br />iv) Past Performance<br />v) Price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation using the Tradeoff process to the responsible Contractor whose offer, conforming to the solicitation is most advantageous to the Government based on the best overall proposal that is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the five evaluation factors: {Technical Capabilities, Technical Approach, Understanding of the Requirement, Past Performance, and Price}. Factor I, Technical Capabilities, Factor II, Technical Approach, and Factor III, Understanding of the Requirement are of equal importance and are significantly more important than Factor III, Past Performance.</p>
<p>Contractors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior equipment than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior equipment. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities), Factor II, (Technical Approach), and Factor III, (Understanding of the Requirement). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Contractors. Therefore, the Contractor's initial offer should contain the Contractor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY:</p>
<p>FACTOR I - TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES: The Contractor shall submit a proposal that includes information on their experience and capabilities in performing the work outlined herein. The information provided must be sufficient enough to allow the Government to make a responsible determination of Contractor capability.</p>
<p>FACTOR II - TECHNICAL APPROACH: The Contractor shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the SOW to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that Contractor is capable of performing the work. The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Contractor's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and in accordance with the SOW and whether the Contractor's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule.</p>
<p>FACTOR III - UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT: The Government will evaluate the Contractor's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Contractor shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in the SOW and the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated.</p>
<p>FACTOR IV - PAST PERFORMANCE: The Government will evaluate past performance of three (3) current or previous contracts for relevancy (within 3 years) with at least one (1) previous or current contract with relevancy within the past 12 months based on how well the contractor performed on projects of similar dollar value, scope, and complexity. Contractors are advised that the Government may use past performance information obtained from centralized past performance databases and sources other than those identified by the Contractor and the information obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision. The absence of past performance data will be rated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Contracts listed may include those entered into with Government agencies or private sectors. For contractors with no relevant corporate past performance, the Government may take into account information regarding the past performance of predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past performance, or subcontractors that will perform key aspects of the requirement. The Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance Questionnaire.</p>
<p>FACTOR V - PRICE: The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal.</p>
<p>ADJECTIVAL RATINGS:<br />Quotes will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this solicitation. The adjectival rating scale is shown below.</p>
<p>Factor I- Technical Capabilities, Factor II - Technical Approach, and Factor III-Understanding of the Requirement, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:</p>
<p>Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Factor IV - Past Performance will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:</p>
<p>Low Risk-Little doubt exists, based on the Contractor's performance record, that the Contractor can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>Medium Risk-Some doubt exists, based on the Contractor's performance record, that the Contractor can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>High Risk-Significant doubt exists, based on the Contractor's performance record, that the Contractor can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>Unknown Risk-Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no favorable or unfavorable evaluation significance.</p>
<p>No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor V, Price.<br /><br />Quotes must be received by Mindy Smith, Contract Specialist, no later than 3:00 PM (EST) on August 3, 2012 and will be accepted by e-mail at smith.mindy@dol.gov. Electronic quotes must be submitted in a format compatible with Microsoft Office 2007 or Adobe and should not exceed 20 pages (total). Quote pricing must be sent as a separate file from the proposal. Quotes must be valid for a period of 45 days and include sufficient information for the Government to make a determination that the Contractor can responsibly deliver the required items and perform the work.</p>
<p>Quotes must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items. Submitting a copy of your Online Representations and Certification Application (ORCA) registration will satisfy this requirement. Registration in the ORCA system is free.</p>
<p>Quotes must include the solicitation number, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, Tax ID number, cage code, Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number, and identification of any commercial items manufactured outside the United States.</p>

Unless a significant price disparity exists which deems a large business suitable for award, award will be made to a small business. Multiple awards will not be considered. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions, therefore, offerors' initial proposal should contain the best terms from a price and technical standpoint. At a minimum, the offeror must submit an offer schedule which asserts they will provide the supplies/services to the minimum standards indicated in the solicitation/PWS; however, it is recommended that as much information as possible be provided for the best value evaluation. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation offers the Best Value to the Government.  "Best value" means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. In accordance with FAR 12.602 & FAR 13.106-2, technical, price & past performance will be considered in the streamlined evaluation. In the best value decision, the Government may consider any readily available value indicators (examples include past performance, special features of the supply or service required for effective program performance, trade-in considerations, probable life of the item, warranty considerations, maintenance availability, environmental and energy efficiency considerations, and delivery terms). This may result in award being made to a higher-rated, higher-priced offeror. The Government's selection of a higher-priced, higher rated offer will be supported by a determination that the technical/past performance superiority of the higher-priced offer warrants the additional cost involved. <br><br>52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, 52.212-4 is amended as follows: Paragraph (g) (1): Change requirement for three copies of invoices to 1 copy of invoices.

This product is also used on the NOAA fishery independent longline cruises based from the Pascagoula laboratory in Mississippi. Initial studies using hook timers (Somerton et al., 1988; Boggs, 1992) relied upon manufacture by Sterling Electronics, Taipei, Taiwan. Unfortunately Sterling Electronics is no longer offering the product and, in fact, Lindgren-Pitman is the only company currently manufacturing digital hook timers.   Lindgren-Pitman hook timers have been used on this project for the past three years.  In order to maintain the standardization, and to ensure consistency across the timeframe of this project, NOAA Fisheries Panama City must use only LP hook timers. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 13, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; bids are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is N62271-12-Q-2049 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 611310 Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools.
The Naval Postgraduate School intends to make a sole source award under FAR 6.302-1 to SCRIPPS Institution of Oceanography for the below referenced effort.
  

Oceanography Department
Spray Glider Support and Updates
1.0 Background

The educational mission of the Oceanography Department at the Naval Postgraduate School is to provide a sound understanding of the science of physical oceanography and to develop the technical expertise to provide and use oceanographic and acoustic data and models in support of all aspects of sea operations and undersea warfare. Our graduate students are contributing partners in our research program and participate in research cruises, present scientific papers at conferences and coauthor journal articles and reports.

The research mission applies the science of physical oceanography to Naval operations. Our areas of expertise include global and littoral/regional numerical prediction, including the increasingly critical polar regions, nearshore oceanography and its impact on mine-counter-measures and amphibious warfare, littoral/coastal oceanography, including the impact of littoral processes, eddies and boundary currents on ocean surveillance systems, and acoustical oceanography with an anti-submarine warfare focus.

One thrust area for the Oceanography Department and the broader Navy is the use of autonomous vehicles in marine monitoring applications.
 A particular class of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) known as ocean gliders is of central interest to the environmental monitoring applications. The Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO) is utilizing groups of ocean gliders for hydrographic survey work. As part of the cooperation between the operational groups within NAVO and the instructional programs in the Oceanography Department, the Department was given two SPRAY-type ocean gliders by NAVO for the purpose of introducing the Department's students and faculty to glider operations. The SPRAY glider is one of a number of vehicles that have been developed in recent years to make profiling ocean observations along remotely controlled paths in the deep ocean autonomously over periods of several weeks to months.

2.0 Scope:

This is a contract to provide a Fixed Firm Price, service to upgrade two SPRAY-type ocean glider vehicles for autonomous operations and to provide operational support and training.
 These services will be provided between 1 August 2012 and 31 December 2012. Services include replacing critical components of the buoyancy systems, ballasting the vehicles, providing real-time web code, and piloting and monitoring of the spray ocean glider during upcoming glider missions in the vicinity of Monterey Bay, California. These services are for preparing gliders using ballast tanks and other facilities designed specifically for SPRAY-type gliders. The mechanical component upgrades are the result of failure studies applied to other SPRAY-type gliders and are considered to be necessary upgrades or repairs that must be conducted before the vehicles owned by the Oceanography Department, specifically serial numbers SPRAY 29 and SPRAY 34, can be safely deployed in the open ocean environment.

3.0 Tasks:

1.	Modify the roll pack for improved reliability operations on SPRAY 29 and SPRAY 34.
2.	Update the hydraulics and electronics for an air vent sub-system on SPRAY 29 and SPRAY 34.
3.	Rebuild the hydraulic pump on SPRAY 29 and SPRAY 34.
4.	Perform pressure testing and inspection on SPRAY 29 and SPRAY 34.
5.	Modify the fiberglass cowlings with external brackets on SPRAY 29 and SPRAY 34.
6.	Provide pilot training and support documentation for SPRAY glider operations.
7.	Set up and maintain the specialized SPRAY piloting web site the upcoming deployments in fall 2012.
8.	Provide consultation regarding piloting and monitoring of the Spray during the upcoming deployments in fall 2012.
9.	Clean up the web site, archive the data, and provide the internal SPRAY flash card data in ascii format following the upcoming deployments in fall 2012.

SF 330s will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firm based on criterion responses.  Failure to provide requested data or to comply with the instructions in this Notice could result in a firm being considered less qualified or eliminated from consideration.  Specific evaluation criteria include:

Criterion 1  Specialized Experience (SF 330 Part 1 Section F):  Offerors will be evaluated on specialized experience and technical competence of the proposed team in provision of the primary tasks required under this contract; knowledge of SDSFIE; and experience in GIS development for federal facilities utilizing ArcGIS and ArcSDE.

Submission Requirements: The Contractor shall provide a maximum of five (5) projects that were completed or substantially completed since June 2007 and best illustrate specialized experience of the proposed team.
  All projects provided in the SF 330 must be completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and perform work under this contract.  Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from evaluation.  The format for the projects shall include:  Experience as prime or consultant (please identify), point of contact name, e-mail address, phone number, contract number or project identification number, contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value and a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above.

  If a project was performed by a joint venture, and all joint venture partners are not on the team proposed for this contract, the offeror/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract.  Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole.  If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

Projects shall be submitted on the SF-330 and shall be completed or substantially completed projects.
  Projects not completed or substantially completed will be excluded from evaluation consideration.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project.  Do not list an IDIQ contract as an example of a completed project.  Instead, list relevant completed task orders that fit within the definition above.  Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified.  

Criterion 2 - Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence (SF 330 Part 1 Section E and Section G):  Offerors will be evaluated on professional qualifications and competence of the key personnel to be assigned to this contract in A-E services to include preparation of the services required under this contract; knowledge of SDSFIE; and experience in GIS development for federal facilities utilizing ArcGIS and ArcSDE; and professional registration of the engineering and surveying staff and ESRI certified trainers, including, but not limited to, PE, RA, GISP, ASPRS.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.369</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications), the information describing what you are offering must be physically written into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum, respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested, your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number).

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective June 7, 2012 electronically. IMPORTANT: CURRENT SCHEDULE 066 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NOTICE: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that effective January 1, 2005, all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website. The ORCA website can be accessed https://orca.bpn.gov. Please note that any offer submitted after July 6, 2012 MUST be submitted on the Solicitation dated June 7, 2012 (Refresh #10) and must be submitted through the eOffer system. Offers submitted on prior versions received after July 6, 2012 will not be accepted. Interested parties may access the solicitation at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

IMPORTANT: CURRENT SCHEDULE 541 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that effective January 1, 2005, all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website.

This product is also used on the NOAA fishery independent longline cruises based from the Pascagoula laboratory in Mississippi. Initial studies using hook timers (Somerton et al., 1988; Boggs, 1992) relied upon manufacture by Sterling Electronics, Taipei, Taiwan. Unfortunately Sterling Electronics is no longer offering the product and, in fact, Lindgren-Pitman is the only company currently manufacturing digital hook timers.   Lindgren-Pitman hook timers have been used on this project for the past three years.  In order to maintain the standardization, and to ensure consistency across the timeframe of this project, NOAA Fisheries Panama City must use only LP hook timers. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>QUESTIONS<br><br>1) In reference to delivery of the vessel, if we are able to offer a quote, we would need to know where the vessel is to be delivered. This information needs to be pinned down because the cost of placement of the vessel can be so unpredictable. Also, the cost of long range delivery above (North on the Mississippi River) Vicksburg, MS could use up all the profit in the contract because of being a small business. Please let us know where we are to deliver the vessel so we can prorate the cost into our unit rate quote if needed. Knowing the delivery point of the vessel will save the Government resources.<br><br>Response:  Based on the current schedule, the most likely delivery location is Cairo, IL mile 958. Schedule is always subject to change and delivery could be required anywhere on the Lower Mississippi River.<br><br><br>2) How many days does the Government guarantee on the contract and what is the estimated amount of (on the job) days of the work? We need this information in order to arrange work for the vessel when the job is completed.<br><br>Response:  The River heavily influences the revetment schedule and has the ability to stop all revetment activities with short notice. No number of days can be guaranteed. Based on the historical low water river stage information approximately 120+ days is anticipated. Funding is currently available for 190+ days if conditions remain favorable. Low water and high water both have the ability to stop production. Short interruptions are of little concern but if the revetment season is ended early the contract vessel would likely return to Vicksburg with the Unit and be released.<br><br>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is hereby modified to extend the due date to July 13, 2012 and to provide Q&amp;A as follows:&nbsp;(Q1) What countries in Latin America will the stringers cover/be geographically based in? Will stringers cover all of Latin America, or will they primarily focus on Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia? (A1) Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela are the three places we will focus on. But most of the coverage will come from Cuba. (Q2) What is the preferred ratio of editors/reporters? (How many stingers will each editor oversee?) (A2) There is no stated preference. (Q3) When is the anticipated start date of the stringers? (A3) September 1, 2012. (Q4) Does the BBG prefer to pay stringers on a production basis (by story), or on a bi-weekly stipend? (A4) We will pay on a production basis, by story. (Q5) What is the workflow of news after the stringer editors have reviewed the article? Does the story move from the editor to BBG directly? Does the BBG have a system in place (portal) for stories to be uploaded? Or should the RFI incorporate a technical solution to achieve that? (A5) We are not looking for just articles, but rather articles, radio and video reports. However, if the interested party can only provide written reports for use in the internet and for our journalists to base their stories on those reports we would still like to see their proposal. (Q6) BBG requests 24/7 capability. Does that mean they want an editor to be on-call 24/7? Will stories that are created/reported during off-business hours be posted by BBG in real-time? (A6) We are looking to have the ability of offering breaking news coverage at any time, but only as events warrant. (Q7) Does the BBG require that stories are translated from Spanish to English, after or simultaneously to publication? (A7) We are willing to waive this requirement. Interested sources may send their submittals by regular U.S. mail, e-mail, or courier. Telephone or facsimile responses ARE NOT acceptable and WILL NOT be considered. All written or courier delivered responses, consisting of original and two (2) copies to this RFI notice, must be received by 2:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), on July 13, 2012 at the Broadcasting Board of Governors, Office of Contracts, Attention: Wayne Greene, (wgreene@bbg.gov), Office of Contracts (CON), Mary E. Switzer Building, 330 "C" St., SW., Room 4007, Washington, DC 20237. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. NO telephone or oral responses will be accepted. Those who respond to this Notice will be notified whether their written "Capabilities Statement," as verified by VOA, is responsive to this Notice. If it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government, interested and qualified sources responding to this Notice may be requested to provide follow-up information. A determination to compete, or not to compete, in a future procurement will be based on the responses to this RFI notice, and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This Notice is not a RFP, IFB, or RFQ.

<DESC><p>*************************************************************************<br />7/6/2012 - Modification I<br />Please see the below for an updated clarification of requirements for 1662121964 - Cyber Career Path Program.&nbsp; For clarification, it was not the intention to state that The SANS Institute provided, or the FBI required&nbsp;both a certification and courses to be supplied through the same vendor.&nbsp; Rather, it is acceptable for the course provider to supply a personnel certification, which is ANSI accredited, through a certifying body.&nbsp; Additionally, it is not required that each individual course be ANSI accredited.&nbsp; Rather, it is only required that an ANSI accredited personnel certification body provide an ANSI accredited certification.&nbsp; It is, however, still required that one vendor be capable of providing all 38 courses, available througout the CONUS, and to provide an agreement with an ANSI accredited personnel certification body to provide an ANSI accredited certification.&nbsp; <br />**************************************************************************<br /><br />PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the Escal Institute of Advanced Technologies, Inc d/b/a The SANS Institute, 8120 Woodmont Avenue, Suite 205 Bethesda, MD 20814 (herein after known as "The SANS Institute") for a Cyber Career Path Program consisting of 38 courses. Additionally, The SANS Institute will provide an agreement with an American National Standards Institute personnel certification body which provides ANSI Accredited Certification in information security. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 541519; Other Computer Related Services.</p>
<p>The Cyber Career Path Program (CCPP) is in response to a greater need within the FBI for Cyber investigators with accredited training. The CCPP will support the ever growing need to combat cyber based threats. The curriculum is specifically aimed at Cyber investigators which consist of FBI cyber agents, task force personnel and other FBI employees. The curriculum will consist of 38 courses as attached. The FBI requires that the program offer an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredited certification. ANSI provides the International Standard ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024 accreditation program for personnel certification agencies. The process used by ANSI to accredit certification bodies is based on an international standard (ISO/IEC 17011). Adherence to a rigorous internationally recognized accreditation process ensures that the ANSI process conforms to the highest accreditation standard and represents the best practices in certification. An ANSI accredited certification is required to ensure Cyber investigators are trained in the most up to date, highest caliber methods and practices to combat cyber threats.</p>
<p>The FBI's requirements are (1) provide all thirty eight courses as attached (not necessarily in name but in subject matter), (2) and an agreement with an ANSI-Accredited personnel certification body to supply the cyber career path program with an ANSI Accredited certification (3) at locations throughout the CONUS. The courses requested must be Commercially-available Off The Shelf (COTS) in accordance with Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Therefore, the vendor should not proffer courses which are "developmental" or in any way not available at the date of award. The FBI does not require the provider to provide these courses solely to the FBI or at an FBI facility, rather it is acceptable to provide seats on an enrollment basis. Based on market research conducted, the previous year's competition returning only one responsible and a sources sought notice released for a two week period, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by The SANS Institute, as no other vendor is capable of providing the Cyber Career Path Program with an ANSI Accredited certification to meet the FBI's requirements.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals to this office by 4:00 pm, EST, by July 12, 2012, by email to the attention of Todd M. Townsend, Contract Specialist, at todd.townsend@ic.fbi.gov with the subject line: "CCPP Capabilities Statement." Conforming information received will be considered by the technical team, solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Should the Government receive one or more viable quotes, this RFQ will subject to a directed competition between The SANS Institute and the capable vendor(s). Should the Government receive no viable quote(s), the award will be made solely to The SANS Institute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The awardee shall be registered in the Central Contractor's Database (CCR) and also the Online Representations and Certification (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

Based on market research conducted, the previous year's competition returning only one responsible and a sources sought notice released for a two week period, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by The SANS Institute, as no other vendor is capable of providing the Cyber Career Path Program with an ANSI Accredited certification to meet the FBI's requirements.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals to this office by 4:00 pm, EST, by July 12, 2012, by email to the attention of Todd M. Townsend, Contract Specialist, at todd.townsend@ic.fbi.gov with the subject line: "CCPP Capabilities Statement." Conforming information received will be considered by the technical team, solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Should the Government receive one or more viable quotes, this RFQ will subject to a directed competition between The SANS Institute and the capable vendor(s). Should the Government receive no viable quote(s), the award will be made solely to The SANS Institute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The awardee shall be registered in the Central Contractor's Database (CCR) and also the Online Representations and Certification (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">This publication serves as notice of intent to procure supplies for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS),&nbsp;Southwest Fisheries Science Center &ndash; Fisheries Ecology Division (SWFSC &ndash; FED)&nbsp;on a sole source basis&nbsp;from <strong>FLIR Systems, Inc</strong>. &nbsp;The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>Proposed vendor will provide one FLIR T640 Infrared Camera and one TXXX ExaminIR Recording and Analysis package. FLIR was identified as the only source that can meet the technical requirements of this&nbsp; procurement because the FLIR T640 is the only camera providing 640 x 480 infrared detection at 50 milliKelvin sensitivity, with a tiltable optical block and integrated visual camera. No other known vendor can provide sensors that provide this level of sensitivity and features.</p>
<p>The government intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price contract with a delivery date of no later than <strong>Oct 29</strong>, 2011. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation, such as the specifications of your product, in writing to the identified point of contact within 10 days after the publication of this notice. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<p><br />52.212-2 AND ADDENDUM<br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. All proposals must be based upon Firm Fixed Prices (FFP), FAR 16.202-1. The following factors and subfactors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL CAPABILITY</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Licensure<br />Subfactor 2 - Certifications <br />Subfactor 3 - Education<br />Subfactor 4 - Past Experience</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - PRICE</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate proposals for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the option prices are not priced out or significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />ADDENDA TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: The award will be made to the vendor whose proposal represents the best value to the government. As allowed by FAR 15.101-2, the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) selection process shall be applied. Award will be made to the vendor who is deemed responsible and responsive that reflects a complete understanding of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and represents the best value to the Government based on selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price for non-cost factors. To be eligible for award, a proposal must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and provide all information required. The technical area will be evaluated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. The government&lsquo;s evaluation of offeror&lsquo;s will also include a past performance assessment. Under the LPTA source selection process, trade-offs are not permitted, proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors, and exchanges with offerors may occur. If the proposal received is determined to be unacceptable, the vendor may be excluded from competition and may not be considered for award.</p>
<p>A. EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: Two (2) separate evaluation factors will be used to evaluate proposals: Factor 1- Technical Capability and Factor 2 - Price.<br />FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL CAPABILITY PROPOSAL:</p>
<p>As a result of the government's evaluation of the aforementioned technical sub-factors and all associated elements accordingly, a determination of acceptable or unacceptable will be assigned for this factor of Technical Acceptability using the following ratings and descriptions:</p>
<p>Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings</p>
<p><br />Rating <br />Description</p>
<p><br />Acceptable <br /><br />Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation as identified in subfactors: Licensure, Certifications, Education and Past Experience. All sub-factors have passed the evaluation.</p>
<p><br />Unacceptable <br /><br />Proposal clearly does not meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Each sub-factor must pass the evaluation in order for the technical factor to pass. Failure to address any sub-factor will deem an offer technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>The government will evaluate technical proposals and the below listed sub-factors on a pass/fail-basis, assigning ratings of acceptable, or unacceptable. An unacceptable rating for any of the below sub-factors will result in an unacceptable rating for this Technical Capability primary factor. Accordingly, under the LPTA source selection approach, offerors who receive an unacceptable rating for this factor, may not be considered for award. If any single area receives a rating of unacceptable, the entire plan will be rated as Unacceptable. Technical Acceptability shall be evaluated against the following sub-factors:</p>
<p>SUBFACTOR 1- Licensure: This subfactor is met when an offeror thoroughly, completely, and accurately submits all of the following criteria listed in this subfactor. Offeror will be evaluated on their ability to provide a vetted license to practice as a Physician Assistant from a US State Board of Medicine. The Government will verify licensure for validity and currency by contacting the issuing institution.<br />SUBFACTOR 2 - Technical Certifications: This subfactor is met when an offeror thoroughly, completely, and accurately submits all of the following criteria listed in this subfactor. <br />4. Basic Life Support (BLS), <br />5. Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) <br />6. Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) <br />The Government will verify certifications for validity and currency by contacting the issuing institution.</p>
<p>SUBFACTOR 3 - Education: This subfactor is met when an offeror thoroughly, completely, and accurately submits all of the following criteria listed in this subfactor. Offeror will be evaluated on their ability to provide proof of current graduation from an approved school of medicine with a Masters degree as a Physician Assistant AND complete a fellowship in emergency medicine acceptable to the US Air Force Surgeon General. When the candidate graduates from a foreign medical school, proof of Foreign Medical Graduation exam passing must be provided. The Government will verify education for validity and currency by contacting the issuing education institution.</p>
<p>SUBFACTOR 5 - Past Experience: This subfactor is met when an offeror thoroughly, completely, and accurately submits documentation of at least two (2) continuous years of recent and relevant past experience within the last thirty-six (36) years. Recent is defined as experience acquired in the last thirty-six (36) years from the closing date of this solicitation. Not Relevant experience is defined as past/present experience effort that did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation required. Relevant is defined as past/present performance efforts involved much of the magnitude of effort and/or complexities this solicitation requires such as; contracts for ER Physician Assistant services as addressed in the PWS. Provide documentation of recent and relevant contracts or employment for government agencies and/or commercial customers.<br />FACTOR 2 - PRICE EVALUATION. <br />An offeror's proposed prices will be verified by multiplying the quantities identified for each item number in the price schedule by the proposed unit price to confirm the extended amount for each price schedule item. The extended price, to include option year, for each item will be added together to arrive at a total evaluated price. As this requirement is a "commercial" service that will result in a "firm-fixed-priced" contract, a comparison of offeror's proposed, competitive prices will satisfy the requirement for price analysis. The price evaluation will be accomplished by conducting price analysis to assess and compare proposed prices and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price as defined in FAR 15.404-1 and FAR 15.305.</p>
<p>Firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience in performing the contract. (FAR 16.202-1)</p>
<p>B. AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those offerors whose proposals are determined to be technically acceptable, and either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. No trade-offs will be permitted between price, and the non-price factor of technical capability. Upon completion of the Government&lsquo;s initial evaluation, Evaluation Notices (ENs) may be issued to offerors within the competitive range, if a competitive range has been established. Once discussions, if conducted, have been concluded, the contracting officer will request a Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Of those offerors found technically acceptable, the award will be made to the lowest priced offeror whose price is determined to be reasonable, realistic, and affordable.</p>
<p>Additional Information for Offerors: <br />Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past experience information or to resolve minor clerical errors). These communications will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>HIPPAA<br />HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA) OF 1996<br /><br />HIPAA is comprised of several different sections, each to be implemented by the Dept. of Health and Human Services. The medical facilities of the military services and the DOD health plans are specifically listed as covered by HIPAA. Currently, HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, are in effect for all MTFs. The specific implementation of HIPAA Privacy for DOD medical facilities is set forth in DOD 6025.18-R, and for HIPAA Security, the requirements for AF MTFs are contained in DOD 8580.02-R and AFI 41-217, which also contains additional Information Assurance requirements for all AF MTFs. DOD 6025.18-R, DOD 8580.02-R and AFI 41-217 are incorporated herein by reference. MTFs are responsible to insure overall compliance with HIPAA requirements, which includes incorporation of certain requirements in contracts entered or amended after the respective implementation dates.<br /><br />IAW these regulations, the Contractor and its employees meet the definition of Business Associates. Therefore, a Business Associate Agreement is required by law to comply with both the HIPAA Privacy and Security regulations. This clause serves as that agreement for each MTF, whereby the Contractor and its employees agree to abide by all HIPAA Privacy and Security requirements regarding health information as defined in this clause, DoD 6025-18-R, DOD 8520.02-R and AFI 41-217.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />APPENDIX 1</p>
<p>NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK (NAC)/HOST AGENCY CHECK (HAC). The government will submit an investigation request for the awardee on AF Form 2583, "Request for Personnel Security Action", at no additional cost to the contractor. The contractor must successfully pass a National Agency Check (NAC) US or Host Agency Check (HAC) UK to be eligible for contract award. Any contractor receiving an unfavorable NAC/HAC shall be Terminated for the Default.</p>
<p>UNESCORTED ENTRY - CAC:</p>
<p>1. Those personnel requiring CAC cards are issued one because they are either authorized Logistical Support (i.e. Commissary, BX, Gas Station) and/or computer access. US personnel shall have a NAC initiated by the gaining units Security Manager or for UK personnel the gaining units HAC POC. It is the Trusted Agents (TA) responsibility to ensure these checks are initiated.</p>
<p>2. The contract award document contains the information whether or not an individual is authorized Logistical Support or requires computer access in performance of their job. This has to be verified by the contractors TA.</p>
<p>3. TA's are individuals assigned by their unit to "sponsor" contractors in Contractor Verification System (CVS) allowing them to be issued a CAC. The TA will initially load the contractor in CVS which prompts the contractor to go into CVS and verify the information. The TA will provide instructions on how this is accomplished.</p>
<p>4. DD Form 1172-2, Application for Department of Defense Common Access Card DEERS Enrollment, must be completed and submitted with the DD Form 557, Appointment/Termination Record- Authorized Signature. The TA must fill out the DD Form 1172-2, all typed, if there is any hand written information on the form (other than signatures) the MPF office will reject the form. The TA must fill in Section I, Employee Information; Section II, Employee Declaration and Remarks, here is where the contractor's security clearance information (NAC or HAC) goes and all authorized Logistical Support, the contractor signs and dates boxes 37 and 38; and Section III, Authorized/Verified By, is where the TA fills in their information. They verify the contractors' signature in Section II and then the TA signs Section III. The DD Form 577, Appointment/Termination Record- Authorized Signature, and as the name implies, verifies the TA's name and signature. This is used to compare the name and signature in Section III of the DD Form 1172-2. MPF will not accept the DD Form 1172-2 or process the contractor in DEERS without a DD Form 577 indicating the TA.</p>
<p>5. Occasionally, a contractor may arrive at RAF Lakenheath assigned to a TA from another base, this is not a problem. In this instance the contractor must ensure they bring with them the completed and signed DD Form 1172-2 and a copy of the TA's DD Form 577.</p>
<p>6. If the contractor has dependents accompanying them the DD Form 1172, Application for Uniformed Services Identification Card/DEERS Enrollment, may be required. The completed form is required if the dependents have never been issued a DoD identification card. The TA is required to fill out and sign the DD Form 1172 and the form must accompany the contractor. If the dependents have a current card then the DD Form 1172 is not required to accompany the contractor as MPF will be able to pull the DD Form 1172 off of the system since the individuals will already be in DEERS. IMPORTANT: Contractors must report to MPF with their passport and Social Security Card and those of their family members as well.</p>
<p>7. The ORIGINAL DD Form 1172-2 and DD Form 1172 must accompany the contractor. This is per the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA); the original is required because MPF must send it to DMDC. If the contractor is assigned a TA from RAF Lakenheath the same information is required.</p>
<p>8. If the contractor is a foreign national they must first complete the steps listed below for a HAC. Once the HAC is complete the contractor must go to MPF and get assigned a Foreign Identification Number (FIN); the contractor will need to coordinate with their TA and MPF. The TA needs the FIN to load the contractor into CVS and it is also required on the DD Form 1172-2. The contractor shall take the completed form to MPF and they will input the DD Form 1172-2 into DEERS and issue the CAC.</p>
<p>9. The contractor shall take all of the required forms and documents to MPF on the ground floor of Bldg 977 and proceed with CAC/ID issuance.</p>
<p>HAC - Host Agency Check:</p>
<p>1. The Ministry of Defence (MoD), Defence Vetting Agency, conducts HAC checks on individuals who are UK nationals, US citizens without componency status (i.e. a retiree who chooses to stay in the UK) or third country nationals (TCN). If a person falls under one these categories they must reside within the UK for 4 years before a HAC will even be accomplished.</p>
<p>2. These individuals will be assigned a HAC POC by their gaining unit. The POC will initiate the MOD Form 1109, Host Agency Check, please keep in mind that this check can take 4 - 6 months to accomplish and is good for 5 years. In conjunction with the MOD Form 1109 the contractor will be required to complete a BCVR, Base Check Verification Record form; the AF Form 2583, Request for Personnel Security Action; and a USAFE Form 19, Residency Check.</p>
<p>3. After return of the security check the following will occur: the gaining units HAC POC will complete the USAFE Form 79 and submit a package with all completed forms to the HAC office for review. If there are mistakes the package is returned for correction and then resubmitted. Once a proper package is completed the HAC POC will give the contractor all required forms to bring to Pass and ID, in Building 977; the number is 01638 52 5990 or DSN 226-5990. Pass and ID will then issue the contractor either a USAFE Form 77, Base Pass, which is good for 365 days or a CAC depending on their required contractual duties.</p>
<p>ESCORTED ENTRY:</p>
<p>1. Contractor personnel requiring escorted entry on to RAF Lakenheath shall provide the first name and surnames of all personnel requiring entry. Provide a list of the vehicles that will be entering the installation to include: make, model and registration number. Also, the Road Tax disc must be current. Also include the award number, location of work and start/stop dates. This shall be on company letterhead and can be either mailed or sent electronically. Bear in mind that regardless of the submittal process the contracting office must have the paperwork five days prior to start of work. <br /><br />2. This information is then submitted to the requesting activity and they in turn provide the information to the Security Forces Operations branch.</p>
<p>NOTE: All contractors must arrive at the installation with a picture ID (i.e. passport or drivers license), if they are not in possession of a picture ID they will not be allowed entry.</p>

<p>HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA) OF 1996<br /><br />HIPAA is comprised of several different sections, each to be implemented by the Dept. of Health and Human Services. The medical facilities of the military services and the DOD health plans are specifically listed as covered by HIPAA. Currently, HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, are in effect for all MTFs. The specific implementation of HIPAA Privacy for DOD medical facilities is set forth in DOD 6025.18-R, and for HIPAA Security, the requirements for AF MTFs are contained in DOD 8580.02-R and AFI 41-217, which also contains additional Information Assurance requirements for all AF MTFs. DOD 6025.18-R, DOD 8580.02-R and AFI 41-217 are incorporated herein by reference. MTFs are responsible to insure overall compliance with HIPAA requirements, which includes incorporation of certain requirements in contracts entered or amended after the respective implementation dates.<br /><br />IAW these regulations, the Contractor and its employees meet the definition of Business Associates. Therefore, a Business Associate Agreement is required by law to comply with both the HIPAA Privacy and Security regulations. This clause serves as that agreement for each MTF, whereby the Contractor and its employees agree to abide by all HIPAA Privacy and Security requirements regarding health information as defined in this clause, DoD 6025-18-R, DOD 8520.02-R and AFI 41-217. Additional HIPAA requirements will be addressed when implemented.</p>

<p>Brief Description of Work:</p>
<p>The objectives of this contract are to (1) construct a mathematical model for containment liner corrosion resulting from a foreign object at the steel liner-concrete interface to determine the evolution of the damage morphology, and (2) calculate the containment leakage rates for the expected degraded area. The scope of work is divided into four (4) tasks that include corrosion model development and calibration, analyses factors that influence corrosion rates and penetration size, leak rate calculations and reporting.</p>
<p>An award was made noncompetitively to NRC's Federally Funded Research and Development Contract (FFRDC) contractor under FAR 6.302-3. A Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) type contract was suitable because of uncertainties involved in contract performance that do not permit cost to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.</p>

<AWARDEE>Myron Bowling Auctioneers, Inc., 3901 Kraus Lane, Hamilton, OH 45014 US
<DESC>Contract was awarded under FAR 6.302-1. Myron Bowling Auctioneers was previously awarded a contract for the management and care of horses located in Illinois and Wisconsin in the Rita Crundwell case.
<p>On April 17, 2012, Rita Crundwell, comptroller for the City of Dixon, Illinois, was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for wire fraud. Ms. Crundwell was accused of embezzling $53 Million from the City of Dixon. On April 18, 2012, the U.S. Marshals Service was notified by the FBI that Ms. Crundwell's bank accounts had been frozen. The defendant was using embezzled money for the care and maintenance of over 300 horses located in various locations nationwide. Since her accounts were frozen, the farms/ranches did not have the means to care for the horses. Farms continued to care for the horses after this date with their own funds even though they were unsure if they would receive payment. The government recognized that there was an immediate need to care for the animals. If a contract was not awarded immediately, the lives of the horses would be at risk. In addition, since the government froze the accounts that were used to feed and care for the horses, the government would have been seen as directly responsible for any harm that came to the horses while these services were suspended.</p>
<p>It was determined to contract with a firm that would oversee the farms currently caring for the horses to limit the risk of health concerns to the animals. One of the roles of the USMS is to ensure that assets subject to forfeiture remain in the same condition as they are seized. By utilizing the same staffing, the maintenance, care, and training of the horses would be conducted in the same manner as prior to forfeiture, thus lowering the risk of any degradation in the condition of the horses.</p>

Emesec, Inc.
1818 Library Ave
Suite 500
Reston, VA  20190
Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)
Items on Contract:  Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Smartcards and test cards


Pertinent Information:
 
On June 29, 2012 A twelve (12) month firm-fixed priced Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract was awarded for PIV smartcards and test cards.  The contract contained a ceiling price of $5,000,000.00. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Integrated Operations Center (IOC) required the purchase of additional smartcards to continue issuance of PIV credentials as mandated by the Deputy Secretary of VA  under Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12 which requires that all eligible personnel be enrolled, validated, and issued PIV credentials.  This contract was awarded to avoid an interruption in the supply of smart cards since supplies are rapidly being depleted.

Justification and Approval is attached.
