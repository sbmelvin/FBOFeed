<DESC>NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has a requirement for the purchase of one (1) modified capstone microturbine unit for use as a spare for the Closed-loop Brayton electrical power system. Under	Contract NNC06CB67C, Barber Nichols designed an electrically-heated, water-cooled, closed-loop Brayton electrical power system which included the modification of two (2) capstone microturbine units.  NASA/GRC intends to purchase the item under Contract NNC06CB67C as new work from Barber Nichols, Arvada, CO. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)(6.302), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The modification of the capstone microturbine unit is proprietary to Barber Nichols as they possess the unique process to modify the capstone microturbine unit. Use of any other source would severely jeopardize the compatibility of the current modified capstone micoturbine units requiring a redesign with increased costs. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 23, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The U.S. Postal Service, Supply Management Facilities Portfolio office, is issuing a Qualification Statement for a regional prequalification  and specific project of design/build firms. The objectives of regional prequalification are as follows: (1) Prequalify design/build on a program basis. (2) To reduce the administrative burden associated with project specific prequalification. (3) Identify a number of sufficient highly qualified firms by geographic area to achieve adequate competition when required.

Interested design/build firms must submit a Qualification Statement that covers the following parameters: (1) Geographic Areas: Northeast, South, Central and West (2) Contract Vehicle: Design/Build (3) Project Dollar Threshold: $10 to 20 million, $20 to $40 million. It is not required that interested firms apply for prequalification in all areas. The USPS seeks to prequalify only the most highly qualified design/build firms in each of the defined geographical areas. 

Note: Contractors who are now prequalified for a given area or dollar amount(s) are not required to submit or resubmit a qualification package.  Contractors who wish to prequalify or contractors who wish to add new areas or dollar amounts must submit a qualification package.

The Postal Service will select the most qualified design/build firms utilizing only the information provided in the Qualification Statement. Because prequalification is a competitive process, meeting the minimum requirements in the Qualification Statement will not guarantee prequalification. Design/build firms that document superior capabilities performance, and experience, will receive the maximum number of points.     A committee appointed by the contracting officer will evaluate Qualification Statements submitted by the due date. 

Respondents must have a minimum of five (5) years experience as a Design/Build Entity and completion or ongoing of three (3) comparable construction projects within the past five (5) years for projects of $10 million to $20 million, and $20 million to $40 million.

For the purpose of this prequalification a comparable project is defined as follows: for projects $10 million to $20 million, and $20 million to $40 million - Industrial / manufacturing buildings used for processing and distribution.  New construction, expansion, major repair and alteration, phased construction in occupied facilities. Projects that include mechanization and / or automation installed by the design builder are preferred and may receive a higher rating. Projects that most closely resemble a USPS mail processing distribution facility in function, structure, systems, etc may also receive a higher rating.

Prequalified design/build firms will be automatically notified for any qualifying project in the geographic area for which the firm is prequalified. Based on this notification the firm may request a copy of the solicitation. The solicitation will not be provided automatically. The USPS does not guarantee a specific number of solicitations will be issued during the prequalification period. The USPS at its. Sole discretion reserves the right to conduct project specific prequalification at any time. Prequalified firms will not be required to re-apply for prequalification. Firms shall be prequalified for a period of 5 years from the date of notification. Renewal: The USPS, at its sole discretion, may extend a firm?s prequalification term for an additional 3 years. This decision will be based on but not limited to performance, capabilities, financial condition, and responsiveness. 

A preproposal meeting will be held at 9:00 am on May 31, 2007 at 4301 Wilson Blvd. Conference Room first floor, Arlington, VA 22203-1840.

Qualification packages are available now and may be obtained by email request to Jose L. Carrasquillo at jose.l.carrasquillo@usps.gov or Bill Powell at bill.powell@usps.gov or written request to either at 4301 Wilson Blvd. Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203-1840.

?	Proximity to Metrorail (within 2,500 walking linear feet)
?	Sole tenancy
?	Onsite, reserved parking spaces for Official Government vehicles
?	Control of lobby for security requirements, inclusive of magnetometers and guards.

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate to alternative space.

Resources inventory legislative authorities, NRCS policy, and responsibilities for conducting the NRI are contained in NRCS General Manual 290, Part 400.
 
Objective/Scope:  The objective of this solicitation is to acquire specified inventory data on two data points in each of about 26 primary sample units (PSU) (a total of about 52 data points) located in 6 counties within the state of Texas, specifically:  Oldham (5 PSUs), Potter (5 PSUs), Carson (2 PSUs), Gray (4 PSU?s), Armstrong (6 PSU?s), and Donley (4 PSU?s).     
      
General Rangeland Inventory Data Elements:  The following categories characterize general data collection needs:  (a) GPS navigation to points and point position capture; (b) ownership; (c) land cover/ use; (d) landscape and soils; (e) ecological site information;(f) rangeland health indicators; (g) noxious weeds and invasive/alien plants; (h) disturbance indicators; (i) conservation practices and resource concerns; (j) line point transects for cover composition; (k) line intercept transects for basal and canopy gaps; (l) cover density and height (Robel Pole); and (m) species composition by weight, production and Similarity Index (SI).

Data Collection:  All data will be recorded in the field on GPS-based Computer Assisted Survey Instruments (CASI) preloaded with government designed and authorized software.

Resources inventory legislative authorities, NRCS policy, and responsibilities for conducting the NRI are contained in NRCS General Manual 290, Part 400.
 
Objective/Scope:  The objective of this solicitation is to acquire specified inventory data on two data points in each of about 50 primary sample units (PSU) (a total of about 100 data points) located in 9 counties within the state of Texas, specifically:  Reeves (5 PSUs), Ward (5 PSUs), Loving (5 PSUs), Winkler (4 PSU?s), Ector (6 PSU?s), Andrews (8 PSUs), Midland (7 PSUs), Glasscock (4 PSUs), and Sterling (6 PSUs).      
      
General Rangeland Inventory Data Elements:  The following categories characterize general data collection needs:  (a) GPS navigation to points and point position capture; (b) ownership; (c) land cover/ use; (d) landscape and soils; (e) ecological site information;(f) rangeland health indicators; (g) noxious weeds and invasive/alien plants; (h) disturbance indicators; (i) conservation practices and resource concerns; (j) line point transects for cover composition; (k) line intercept transects for basal and canopy gaps; (l) cover density and height (Robel Pole); and (m) species composition by weight, production and Similarity Index (SI).

Data Collection:  All data will be recorded in the field on GPS-based Computer Assisted Survey Instruments (CASI) preloaded with government designed and authorized software.

Workload and Logistics:   It is anticipated that 2 persons will be required at each site to physically collect and enter data into the CASI.  It is estimated that one PSU (2 points) can be completed within 16 to 18 total staff hours.

Confidentiality Statement:  Successful contractor(s) will be required to sign a confidential agreement under UNITED STATES CODE, Title 18, Section 1905; UNITED STATES CODE, Title7, Section 2276 and UNITED STATES CODE, Title 7, Section 2240 for non-disclosure of confidential information relative to data site locations and/or use of composite data.

This will be a Request for Proposal (RFP) acquisition for a firm fixed-price contract using both price and past performance.  Prior to contract award the contractor must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  The NAICS Code is 541990.  This project is restricted to Small Business.  Registration in TechReg (TSP) is not required, but highly encouraged.  Solicitation will be posted and be available to download on or about May 21, 2007.  Price range is $25,000 - $100,000.

<CONTACT>Joan Gantt, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-691-6043, Fax 202-691-6026, Email gantt.joan@bls.gov - Michelle Govan, Purchasing Agent, Phone 202-691-6010, Fax 202-691-6026, Email Govan_M@bls.gov
<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics intends to enter into a sole source contract under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with Management System Group, 565 Virginia Drive,Fort Washington, Pennsylvania,19034-2706, to provide address lists from sampling frames for the Consumer Price Index Housing Survey. Total cost for this requirement will NTE $20,000. 




In 2006, the BLS entered into a contract with Marketing Systems Group (MSG) to provide address lists for sampling frames for the Consumer Price Index Housing Survey.  MSG was the sole respondent for the RFQ (BLS 06-101).  Additionally, research conducted in 2002 and 2003 by Westat under contract from the BLS had previously concluded that MSG address lists were superior to other available address lists in terms of the needs of the CPI Housing Survey.  This conclusion was reinforced by our own research during the same period as well as a field test in 2004 that showed that address lists from MSG were suitable for our use.

When the 2006 RFQ was issued and the contract with MSG was signed, the CPI program was operating under the assumption that the geographic sample design of the CPI in future years would consist of 75 Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), or cities.  Since that time, a decision was made to proceed instead with an 86 PSU design.  As a result, the number of address lists needed for sampling frame development in the CPI Housing Survey has risen.

Based on the above, BLS believes that MSG is the only company that can meet our needs.  Any organization that thinks they can provide these services may submit their capabilities and pricing
to Joan Gantt.  All Respones will be evaluated.

Responses must be received by May 15, 2007 at 10 A.M. ET

<DESC>15 CONS is seeking the interest of potential and eligible contractors in an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at Hickam AFB, Bellows AFB, and other installations in the Hawaiian Islands.  The MACC is a contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design.  Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 ? Construction, Subsection 233 ? Building Development and General Contracting ? size standard $31 Million (except dredging and surface cleanup activities;  Subsector 234 ? Heavy Construction ? size standard $13 Million and Subsector 235 ? Special Trade Contractors ? Size standard $13 Million. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades. Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order.  Individual task orders may range between estimated $200,000 - $5,000,000, but may be less or greater.  The program is Not-to-Exceed $90,000,000 over a five-year period.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.  The government anticipates awarding  approximately 5 contracts. The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3).  In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference. The RFP will identify a seed project, which will be awarded to the highest rated offeror for the first award.  All other successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $2,500.  The government will compete future individual requirements among the awardees.  An actual solicitation is expected to be issued on or about 22 June 2007.  The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation, including the specifications and drawings, will be made available only on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) singe government point of entry (GPE) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov at that time.  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package. Potential offerors MUST register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation. All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov. Prospective offerors who would like their company name included on the Bidders Mailing List (planholder's list) may do so on the fedbizopps website under IVL (Interested Vendor?s List). The government intends to host an industry day at Hickam Air Force Base in order to field questions on the MACC. The date is to be announced. If you are interested in attending the industry day, contact the contract administrator Geoffrey.Levine@Hickam.af.mil. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs. For further opportunities, you may review AF needs at http://www.selltoairforce.org. For other opportunities and information go to the small business administration web site at http://www.sba.gov. or contact our small business specialist James.Watanabe@Hickam.af.mil.

It is anticipated that future projects in each designated area will be awarded on a task order basis to the one contractor (of the seven awardees) who offers the lowest lump sum price.  

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals will be evaluated using a Two-Phase process.  Phase I will be technical evaluations; Phase II will be for pricing.  The Government intends to use the "best value concept" in making the selections.  The "best value concept" is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation; with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors.  Phase I, the Request for Proposal (RFP), contains Construction Contract Clauses, Labor Standards, Solicitation Provisions, Proposal Submittal Requirements and Evaluation Factors.  The RFP will be issued on or about 5/21/2007.  Proposals shall be received in the Office of Business and Support Services (6ADB), Federal Building, 1500 E.

Offerors may submit proposals in as many of the designated areas as they wish, but only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror in each of the designated geographic areas.  Offerors will be required to indicate which of the designated area(s) for which they wish to be considered.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may make award without discussions.  Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  For this solicitation, technical quality is significantly more important than cost or price.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in descending order of importance are: (1) Experience of the Firm (2) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Technical Approach.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.

The RFP will be available from the General Services Administration through the GPE on FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov).  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.

Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions.  

Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company?s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

<DESC>The Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS), NIAID, NIH, supports research to identify therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of infections with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and co-infections with pportunistic pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  DAIDS-sponsored researchers are actively engaged in investigating the basic biology of the targeted pathogens, identifying novel therapeutic approaches to treat diseases caused by these infectious agents, and testing therapeutic agents in vitro and in animal models.  Prior to evaluation in clinical trials, most experimental agents require chemical resynthesis, pharmaceutical analysis, and dosage formulation to ensure products are of sufficient quantity and quality to permit proper testing in humans.  DAIDS currently uses contracts to fulfill its needs for these services.  This solicitation will support the DAIDS drug development effort by accomplishing the synthesis of therapeutic agents in small and large scale amounts, some according to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This solicitation provides for the recompetition of a contract (N01-AI-05402) that was awarded to Starks Associates, Inc. for synthesis of potential therapeutic agents for treatment of infectious diseases.  Over 250 different compounds of interest to DAIDS have been synthesized to date.  Compounds assigned for synthesis include heterocycles (typically containing nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur), carbocycles, carbohydrates, nucleosides and peptides.  The majority of synthesized compounds have been used by DAIDS-supported contracts for enzymatic, in vitro, and in vivo studies.  Small quantities of metabolites have been synthesized for use in mechanism of action and metabolism studies and larger, bulk quantities of compounds have been synthesized for animal studies and clinical trials.  The scope of this effort is small scale synthesis of compounds in quantities required for testing in either in vitro screens or animals, and large scale synthesis of compounds for early Phase I clinical studies.  Some compounds will require synthesis in compliance with cGMP regulations.  This contract will provide resources for the synthesis of promising compounds for the treatment of HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis and other infectious diseases of relevance to the research agenda of NIAID.  The major tasks to be carried out are as follows:  1) Initial transition; 2) Synthesize compounds (small scale); 3) Synthesize compounds (large scale); 4) Acquire compounds for efficacy testing; 5) Ship compounds to NIAID; 6) Provide facilities, equipment, and other resources; 7) Information Security; and 8) Final transition.  This is a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a period of seven (7) years beginning on or about February 16, 2008.  It is estimated that six (6) full time equivalents (FTE) will be required on a yearly basis.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government. This RFP will be available electronically on/about May 23, 2007, and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and through the FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), Regulatory Support Affairs contract will provide regulatory expertise, technical, and administrative support for DMID's clinical research programs.<br>
</br>
Research supported and conducted by the NIAID, NIH, DHHS, strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID, DMID supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.<br> 
</br>
Developing and testing new vaccines and therapies have historically been a major focus of the research supported by the DMID.  Much of this research is devoted to addressing critical public health needs, such as those related to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (e.g., avian influenza and West Nile Virus), as well as those supporting the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates against potential agents of bioterrorism, including NIAID priority biodefense pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm).<br>   
</br>
In order to ensure that the development, testing and manufacture of products evaluated under DMID-supported clinical research are executed with a rigor that will support licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), DMID supports an infrastructure to provide regulatory assistance in the development and testing of these products.<br>  
</br>
Currently, DMID sponsors approximately 100 Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) or Master Files (MFs) which span more than 200 clinical trials.  This includes both multicenter trials and single center studies, and encompasses Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials performed at both domestic and foreign sites.  DMID files approximately 10-20 new INDs each year, and in this capacity, serves as the official IND sponsor and liaison with the FDA with respect to all regulatory requirements.  Currently, the DMID IND portfolio is comprised of approximately 75% vaccine and other biologic INDs (monoclonal), 20% drug INDs, and 5% MFs.  In addition, it is anticipated that Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) will be required during the contract period of performance.<br>
 </br>
It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a seven-year period of performance beginning on or about 
April 1, 2008.<br>  
</br>
Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about May 22, 2007 and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Headquarters (NAVFACHQ) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with Appleton Marine, Incorporated, 3030 E. Pershing Street, P.O. Box 9020, Appleton, Wisconsin, for the fabrication, testing, and delivery of an interface system to mount the Amphibious Bulk Liquid Transfer System (ABLTS) on Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS) modules. The INLS/ABLTS Interface System (IAIS) includes the following components:  two (2) hose reel interface frames; one (1) bow chute interface frame; and one (1) shear connector cover assembly.  The IAIS bow chute assembly is positioned on the deck at the front of the INLS intermediate module to constrain the ABLTS hoseline safely on the foredeck.  The IAIS shear connector cover assembly is used to cover the shear connectors on the front of the INLS intermediate causeway, protecting the hoseline from fouling, snags, and other damage.  It is anticipated that the Government will award a firm fixed price contract for a base year and two one-year option periods.  Appleton Marine is the only manufacturer who can guarantee delivery of the IAIS systems by 13 July 2007 (thereby saving 4 weeks of production time and preventing slippage into the Material Maintenance Cycle 10 schedule in 2010) and in time to meet the critical INLS delivery and loadout schedule supporting the Maritime Prepositioning Force deployment of INLS.  Award of the base year quantities will be in accordance with FAR 6.302-2, unusual and compelling urgency.  Appleton Marine is also the original designer and manufacturer of the IAIS prototype, and owns the jigs and fixtures used to manufacture the IAIS.  Thus, this is a follow-on contract for the production of one-of-a-kind equipment and it is demonstrable that award to any other source would result in duplication of development and one-time production costs that would not be recovered through a price-based competition.  Therefore, award of the option year quantities will be in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The North American Industry Classification System code for this requirement is 332312, with a size standard of 500 employees.  The Procurement Contracting Officer is Ms. Selinda Joyner and all inquiries should be directed to Ms. Joyner via email at Selinda.Joyner@navy.mil and Mr. Robert Smith at robert.g.smith1@navy.mil.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION FOR Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers for Space Applications.

Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office, Air Force Research Laboratory, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/MLM) is contemplating a procurement to create a domestic, merchant K-band (18-21.2 GHz, sometimes also referred to as Ka-band) TWTA production capacity in order to meet the future defense requirements for satellite communications links.  The government intends to release a solicitation for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), "Only One Responsible Source."  The government contemplates the award of a contract or an assistant instrument   (with cost share) for this requirement to L-3 Communication's Electron Technology Inc. division, based on their status as the sole domestic manufacturing source for space-qualified TWTAs.  L-3 has demonstrated technology and manufacturing readiness levels for K-band TWT/TWTAs that prepare them for immediate production scale-up.  The period of performance for the procurement is anticipated to be 36 months.  Additional phases may be awarded based on future funding availability.  A description of the task is as follows:  Establish a viable business as a domestic, merchant supplier of space-qualified TWTs and TWTAs with greater than 100W power in the 18-21.2 GHz frequency range.  Interested parties must demonstrate that they meet all requirements as follows: domestic producer (For the purposes of this contract, the Government defines a domestic producer as a production source which manufactures, supplies, and supports the use of its products by customers who represent end users independent of either internal or sister organizations.  In light of this requirement, a Title III domestic producer of space-qualified TWTAs may not, as a matter of policy, place restrictions or limitations on which customers may buy or how they may subsequently use its products.) as defined by the DPA; merchant producer (A merchant producer is defined as the ability to establish acceptance and credibility among potential customers of products within the Production Technology Partnership topic.  Demonstrated commitment to being a merchant supplier (willingness to sell to all prospective industrial and military customers, as opposed to exclusively "captive" or internal customers.) as defined by the Government; completed design development for the proposed device; technology and manufacturing readiness levels that prepare the manufacturer for production scale-up; capability to produce like products for space applications; confirmable space heritage of their existing product portfolio. Offerors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.   Inquiries pertaining to this acquisition should be addressed to Mr. Norm Willis, (937) 656-7197, or Ms. Laura Ortiz, (937) 656-9883, AFRL/PKMD, 2310 Eighth Street, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7801.  Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  All responsible sources may submit information, which shall be considered by the agency.  Any information received for this Notice of Contract Action will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

All development activities related to this BAA are subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data, the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, Execu tive Order 12470, and/or DOD Directive 5230.25.  This acquisition is not open to foreign firms, including any subcontracting effort under this BAA.  Any contractor or subcontractor considering this BAA is advised that foreign national employees are prohibi ted from participating or working on the effort. Foreign Nationals (also known as foreign persons) means any person who is NOT a citizen or naturalized citizen of the US; or a lawful permanent resident; or a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C 1324b (a)(3).  To streamline the proposal process and assist offerors in determining whether to incur costs to generate a formal BAA proposal, offerors must first submit a summary concept paper for evaluation. From this summary concept paper, the Government will  indicate whether the subject matter technology described in the proposal is of interest to the Government and whether a formal proposal should receive additional review.  The Government, at its option, may provide comments that may be of assistance to any  submitter on whether to submit a formal BAA proposal.   Concept papers will be evaluated upon receipt.  Acknowledgement of receipt of concept papers will not be made nor returned.  After initial review, the Contracting Office will ask only those offerors with promising concept papers to submit full technical and cost proposals.  The Contracting Office will notify offerors within 90 days of receipt of concept paper if a full proposal is requested.  Concept papers not selected for full proposal submission wi ll be disposed of in a manner to protect proprietary data.  All proprietary material in any submission should be clearly identified as proprietary in nature. The summary concept paper should include the proposed technical concept, rationale, objectives, me thodology, expected results, and the potential contribution to the USA AMRDEC.  In addition, the summary concept paper should include a period of performance, anticipated cost, and any evidence of the offerors past performance on Government contracts. The  concept papers are limited to 5 pages (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced), in English text, in MS Word for Windows" format, with one additional page for technical drawing if necessary.  All concept papers, proposals, written communications or documentation concern ing this BAA shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Earnest Taylor, via e-mail earnest.taylor@us.army.mil with a copy to Ms. Valerie Tipton, via e-mail valerie.tipton@us.army.mil.  Facsimile proposal submission is not authorized under this anno uncement.  In no event shall classified data be included in the concept paper or proposal.  Evaluation of concept papers by the Government will determine which efforts are of sufficient interest to merit a formal proposal.  Concept papers will be evaluated  based on technical merit, the offerors past performance, and the potential contribution to the mission of the USA AMRDEC. Technical merit will rank significantly higher than past performance. Technical merit will be determined by evaluating the following  factors:  (1) Th e concept paper has pertinent novel ideas in the specific branch of science and technology involved, (2) The offeror has availability, from any source, of necessary research, test, laboratory, or shop facilities, and (3) The proposal is from a technically qualified source.  If there is sufficient interest, a formal proposal will be requested.  Contractors are not authorized to submit a formal proposal unless expressly requested to do so by the Contracting Office.  This announcement is an expression of inter est only and does not commit the Government to make any contract award or to obligate government funds to pay for response preparation costs. The cost of proposal preparation or response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resul tant contract or any other contract. Interested parties should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published. Proposals may range from theoretical studies to a proof-of-concept that includes fabrication, delivery and test of prototypes. USA AMRDEC is interested in receiving proposals for the research efforts described under this BAA. USA AMRDEC contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research in those technical areas listed above.  Any contract awar ds that may result from this BAA are expected to be either in the form of Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee completion and/or level of effort. For planning purposes, awards made in response to formal proposals are anticipated in the $100K to $30M range for the basic con tract with a period of performance not to exceed 36 months.  In addition to the basic contract, up to four option years can be proposed.  However, the total contract value (of each individual contract) within the formal proposal for both the basic and opti on years cannot exceed $75M, and the total period of performance for the basic and option years cannot exceed 60 months This time period limitation includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of any final report.  The following reports may be  required (specific reporting requirements will be specified by the Government in the event a contractor is requested to submit a formal proposal):  1. FUNDS AND MAN-HOUR EXPENDITURE REPORT, DI-FNCL-80331/M, monthly; 2. TECHNICAL REPORT, DI-MISC-80508, as required and a one time Final report; 3. STATUS REPORTS, DI-MGMT-80368, monthly; 4. SOFTWARE PRODUCT SPECIFICATION (SPS),DI-IPSC-81441, as required; 5. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN (SDP), DI-IPSC-81427, as required. 6. PERIODIC PROGRAM REVIEWS (such as IPRs, SRRs, SDRs, etc.), as required.  7.DA Manpower Reporting Requirements.   Long-term proposals, or proposals that include proposing for both the basic contract period and option periods, should contain a summary of the work contemplated for each 12-month per iod, so that contracts may be negotiated for an entire five-year project or for individual one-year increments of the total project.  A detailed performance schedule for each discrete task must be included along with cost data to include labor-by-labor cat egory in any formal proposal. The Government will provide any selected offerors with formal proposal content requirements. Formal proposal content and format shall contain, not be limited to: (1) Statement of Work (SOW): The SOW should be a concise documen t suitable for incorporation into a resultant contract, that provides a qualitative description of the proposed work in terms of technical advancement, improvement, or end product to be developed.  The SOW should state the objectives, and how these objecti ves would benefit the Government.  These objectives should be stated in terms of their potential usefulness to the Research & Development and Warfighter communities supported by the USA AMRDEC. The SOW should also include a proposed schedule detailing sign ificant milestones and deliverables. (2)  One page resumes of the offeror's key personnel (including alternates, if desired) who will be involved in the researc h.  Documentation of previous work or experience in the field of the offeror is especially important. (3)  The type of support, if any, the offeror requests of the USA AMRDEC, such as facilities, equipment, or materials. Any request by offerors for Governm ent furnished property/equipment must be clearly identified in the proposal. In no event shall the Government be under any obligation to grant such requests. Thus, offerors should be prepared to provide viable alternate approaches in the event the Governme nt is unwilling or unable to provide the requested property/equipment. (4)  A statement regarding possible impact, if any, of the proposal's effect on the environment. (5)  A brief description of your organization.  (6)  The facilities to be used for the w ork.  (7) A listing of current R&D contracts along with Government POCs (contracting officer & technical). Offerors shall specify any identified potential organizational conflicts of interest.  The financial portion of the proposal should contain a detaile d cost estimate sufficiently detailed for meaningful evaluation by Government officials. The budget must include the total estimated cost of the project, including any potential for cost overruns.  Universities are reminded that costs for research projects  conducted on behalf of the U.S. government are governed exclusively by OMB Circular A-21.The estimated project costs must be broken down for each year of the program to show the following: (1) A list of participants, not necessarily by name, showing the t ime and number of direct productive person hours (DPPHs) to be charged by principal investigator(s), research associates, and assistants, and the total amount per year to be paid to each from the project.  For proposals from universities, the time and amou nts to be charged should be identified by academic year and summer effort. (2)  An itemized list of permanent equipment showing the cost of each item. Permanent equipment is any article of non-expendable tangible personal property having a useful life of m ore than two years, and an acquisition cost of $500 or more per unit. (3)  A general description and total estimated cost of expendable equipment and supplies. (4)  Contemplated expenditures for travel with brief explanation.  Travel budgets that exceed $1 ,500 per principal investigator per year or that include foreign travel or travel by other than principal investigators will require special investigation. (5)  Other direct costs. (6)  Cost for consulting services, if any, showing number of days, daily ra tes, and estimated travel/per diem costs.  The need for consulting services must be fully justified. (7)  Indirect costs indicating whether rates used are fixed or provisional, and the time frames to which they are applicable (e.g., a fixed rate may apply until a specified date, after which the rate becomes provisional). (8)  The fee, if any, which the organization proposes to assess the research project. (9)  Subcontracts and material costs proposed must be fully supported and documented (written quotes, e ngineering estimates, etc).  Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), it is the policy of the Government to enable small business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors performing work or rendering s ervices as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts, and to assure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy.  Subcontracting goals for small and small disadvantaged businesses (including HBCUs/MIs) are 23 and 5 percent, respectively.  Subcontracting goals for women-owned small business are 5%, for HUBZone small business 3%, and for service-disabled veteran-owned small business 3%.  These goals will be considered when proposals are submitted.  The Government antic ipates that any contract resulting from this BAA will be funded on an incremental basis as provided by FAR 52.232-22 Limitation of Funds.  Any formal proposal  approval is subject to fiscal law statutory restrictions governing the availability of government funds.  Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit and not against other proposals submitted under this announcement.  The primary basis for selecting pr oposals for award shall be technical merit and importance to agency mission requirements and R&D programs.  Management, cost realism, and past performance shall also be considered.  The following factors will be considered in the evaluation of proposals re ceived under this BAA. General:  The government selection of the proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the government considering technical and management in accordance with the evaluation  criteria, cost, and fiscal law constraints governing availability of funds, using the factors set forth below. The Government anticipates the possibility of multiple awards under this Broad Agency Announcement, although no minimum or maximum number of awa rds is guaranteed.  THE GOVERNMENT EXPRESSLY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE FORMAL RESPONSES RECEIVED. Evaluation Factors for Technical Area: a. Overall Scientific/Technical Quality - The offeror will be evaluated on the overall scientific/technical merits of the proposed research and development.  The scientific/technical merits may include potential for state-of-the-art improvement, with special emphasis on innovation, originality and uniqueness. b. Qualifications - Capabilities and qualifications of the key research personnel, relevant offeror experience, and adequacy of facilities and instrumentation as required. c. Research and Development Contribution - Potential contribution of the proposed research to USA AMRDEC  in the above technology areas. Evaluation Factors Management Area: a. Overall Scheduling and Planning - The offeror's approach will be evaluated based on the overall scheduling and planning for performance of the effort. b. Expenditure Control - The appro ach for controlling expenditures and labor hours. Evaluation Factors Cost Area: a. Cost realism analysis will be conducted to assess the likelihood that the technical management approaches proposed could be accomplished at the cost proposed. b. Total Evalu ated Probable Cost.  The proposal will be evaluated to develop the government's estimate of the most probable cost to the government of successfully completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed.  An unreasonably priced pro posal may be indicative that the offeror does not fully understand the scope of the proposed effort.  The cost area will not receive an adjectival rating.  Evaluation Factors Past Performance Area: a. Past Performance is one indicator of an offerors abili ty to perform the contract successfully.  b. The proposal will be evaluated upon information received from the offeror, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offerors past performance.  Currency and relevance of the i nformation, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in an offerors past performance shall be considered.  c. Proposals should include evidence of past performance of both management and technical performance, including past or c urrent contracts (including Federal, State, local government and private contracts for efforts similar to the proposed effort.  Offerors are also authorized to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offerors correc tive actions, if applicable.  The evaluation team shall determine the relevance of any similar past performance information. Other relevant information may include past performance information concerning predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant e xperience, or proposed subcontractors that may perform major or critical aspects of the requirement if relevant to the proposals at issue here.  Past performanc e of offerors in complying with subcontracting plans goals for small disadvantaged business concerns (SDB), monetary targets for SDB participation, and extent of participation of SDB concerns in terms of the total value of the acquisition, are all factors that will be considered in evaluating past performance. Proposals from entities without a record of past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available are still encouraged, as such offerors will not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably on this evaluation subfactor.  Relative Importance of Evaluation Criteria: 1. Technical:  The technical area is significantly more important than the management area.  The factors under the technical area are of equal importance. 2. Manageme nt:  The management area is significantly less important than the technical area.  The factors under the management area are of equal importance. 3. Cost: Although the technical and management areas are more important than the cost area, cost is still cons idered a significant evaluation factor. Proposed costs must be fully detailed and have a complete justification.   The total proposed cost must be within the total contract value as specified in the Introduction of this BAA. 4. Past Performance: Past perfo rmance is significantly less important than the technical factor, but is still considered significant, as it indicates that the offeror can successfully accomplish the proposal upon any award.  Government will award favorably evaluated proposals based on a vailability of funds and interest to AMRDEC.  Selection of proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the government considering technical, management, and cost.  The number of awards, if any, are subject to fiscal law constraints on availability of funds.  Participants are requested to submit proposals containing information in either the unclassified or classified category, up to the Secret level.  The contractor will be required to receive an d store information at a classification level matching his submittal, which must fall within the categories of unclassified or classified up to the Secret level. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) o f the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of  PL 98-369, he Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  This BAA shall remain in effect for a period of one-year from date of synopsis.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to award a sole-source contract to MTC Services Corporation, 344 F St STE 202, Chula Vista, CA 91910-2646 for the implementation and support services for the Marine Corps Architecture Tool (MCAT).  The justification for the proposed award is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  The implementation of the MCAT requires that the current MCISR-E Architecture Tool (MAT) be installed and configured to work within the MARCORSYSCOM global environment.  The current MAT program provides architecture development, configuration management, Information Assurance Vulnerability Assessment management, and analysis capabilities.  MTC Services Corporation is the only responsible source who can implement and support the MCAT.    MTC Services Corporation is uniquely qualified because they are the only developer of this software and can p!  rovide the necessary training, technical consulting, and technical support services.   NOTE:  The period of performance and acquisition value for this requirement has been modified.  The base contract will have a period of performance of May 2007 through May 2008, with an additional option year for support services.  The estimated value of the acquisition, inclusive of all options, is $105K. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within seven (7) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Evidence must be provided of your ability to perform the required services.  Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  Inquiries will only be accepted via e-mail to  sakeena.siddiqi@usmc.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS A CANCELLATION NOTICE.  This synopsis constitutes the cancellation of Naval Facilities Engineering Command Headquarters (NAVFACHQ) solicitation number N00025-07-R-0002 (which closed on 30 April 2007) for the fabrication, testing, and delivery of an interface system to mount the Amphibious Bulk Liquid Transfer System (ABLTS) on Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS) modules.  NAVFACHQ intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract (for a base plus 2 option years) with Appleton Marine, Incorporated, 3030 E. Pershing Street, P.O. Box 9020, Appleton, Wisconsin, in order to fill this requirement.   Appleton Marine is the only manufacturer who can guarantee delivery of the IAIS systems by 13 July 2007 (thereby saving 4 weeks of production time and preventing slippage into the Material Maintenance Cycle 10 schedule in 2010) and in time to meet the critical INLS delivery and loadout schedule supporting the Maritime Prepositioning Force deployment of INLS.  Award of the base year quantities will be in accordance with FAR 6.302-2, unusual and compelling urgency.  Appleton Marine is also the original designer and manufacturer of the IAIS prototype, and owns the jigs and fixtures used to manufacture the IAIS.  Thus, this is a follow-on contract for the production of one-of-a-kind equipment and it is demonstrable that award to any other source would result in duplication of development and one-time production costs that would not be recovered through a price-based competition.  Therefore, award of the option year quantities will be in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Procurement Contracting Officer is Ms. Selinda Joyner.  All inquiries should be directed to Ms. Joyner via email at Selinda.Joyner@navy.mil and Mr. Robert Smith at robert.g.smith1@navy.mil.****

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO CLARIFY THAT THE PROPOSAL DUE DATE FOR SOLICITATION NO. RES-07-047 IS MAY 10, 2007 AT 12:00 P.M.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) established the Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) program in 1979. The primary objective of this program was and continues to be the systematic evaluation of the risk-significance of U.S. commercial nuclear power reactor operational events. Under this requirement, the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) of the NRC will systematically evaluate U.S. nuclear plant operating experience to identify and document the operating events that were most likely to lead to inadequate core cooling and severe core damage (precursors), if additional failures had occurred. Using standardized plant-specific models provided by the NRC, the contractor shall perform detailed risk analyses of events or conditions that have occurred during all phases of reactor operations. Additionally, the contractor shall perform Large Early Release Frequency (LERF) analyses when requested for selected events, again using models provided by the NRC.  The contractor shall also provide on-call probabilistic risk analysis support to NRC staff for regulatory issues. 

It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. 

The period of performance of the resultant contract will be four (4) years and six (6) months. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about March 26, 2007 and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website. Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will not be available. Because this solicitation and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, interested parties are instructed NOT to send letters or e-mails or faxes requesting the RFP. Telephoned, e-mailed, or faxed requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. 

The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. 

The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipts of $4.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS 541330.  

Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Notice to large businesses: The subcontracting plan requirements of P.L. 95-507 are applicable to this effort. Thus, all large businesses determined to be in the competitive range must be prepared to submit a detailed subcontracting plan.

FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL-Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514

TITLE:  Global Response and Synchronization

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 06-14-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 should be submitted by 31 May 2006; FY 07 by 15 Oct 2006; FY 08 by 1 May 2007; and FY 09 by 1 May 2008.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 31 Oct 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the area of information discovery and delivery, advanced, multi-constraint and distributed optimization techniques and evaluation models to support mobility operations across a broad set of missions.

The Air Force's Air Mobility Command (AMC) provides global air support for the entire Department of Defense. This includes air support for the President, day-to-day operational support, natural disaster support, humanitarian support, aerial refueling, and warfighter support during operations in hostile environments. Current operations include the planning and execution of over seven hundred (700) sorties per day.  They are hampered by limited support to aircrews, who receive an inadequate near-real time view of the mission and less-than-current information on changes in weather and airport capabilities. Limited connectivity to the aircraft, characterized by only basic voice communications and limited data transmissions, creates problems for the dynamic decision making required in a changing environment. This BAA addresses the need to provide enhancements in information discovery and delivery, advanced, multi-constraint and distributed optimization techniques, timely situation awareness of AMC global activities, enhanced decision aiding and course of action analysis through automation and evaluation models to support mobility operations with special emphasis on increased efficiency and decreased routine workload across functional and supervisory positions.  The requirement is for open-architected, scalable, and government-owned solutions to these issues and is soliciting white papers for innovative technologies to support command and control applications that can significantly reduce the time between information technology availability and its employment into the research and development programs that will support and improve legacy and new military electronic systems operations. Also of interest are commercial technologies that can improve the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, and usability of these new and legacy military electronic systems.

The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate and demonstrate system technologies.  The developed capabilities may be transitioned to AMC programs, for example Global Decision Support System (GDSS) 2, and US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) programs.

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.5M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06-$40K; FY 07-$8.95M; FY 08-$8.25M; and FY09-$7.26M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $40,000 to $1,200,000 per year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:

1.  ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS:  All foreign allied participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.

2.  COST SHARING OR MATCHING:  Cost sharing is not a requirement.

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.

In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to advise potential offerors of the posting of a draft Statement of Work (SOW) and a draft Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) for the Mission Operations Elements (MOE) for the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). The LDCM project of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Code 427, seeks industry comment on the draft SOW and draft CDRL, which are currently available for review on the LDCM web site at http://ldcm.nasa.gov.  Comments shall be submitted to GSFC, Code 210.6, Greenbelt, MD 20771, Attn: Michelle D. McIntyre or via e-mail to Michelle.D.McIntyre@.nasa.gov on or before May 23, 2007.  This notice also seeks capabilities from small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business goals for this requirement.  The NAICS Code is 541330 with a size standard of $4.5 million.  Your response must specifically address capabilities and past experience in developing comprehensive satellite mission operations hardware and software systems, including command and control, command encryption/authentication, planning and scheduling, flight dynamics, trending and analysis, memory and flight software management, and automation capabilities. Interested offerors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of six (6) pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described in the draft SOW. Two (2) copies of capability statements shall be submitted to the GSFC, Code 210.6, Greenbelt, MD 20771, Attn: Michelle D. McIntyre or e-mail a copy to Michelle.D.McIntyre@.nasa.gov on or before May 23, 2007. To facilitate a prompt review by the NASA team, a one (1) page summary, to be counted within the six-page limit, shall be affixed to the front of the capability statement submitted which identifies for the evaluator, by page and paragraph, your company's relevant capabilities. It is insufficient to provide only general brochures or generic information. Additionally, responses must include the following: name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number). Procurement related questions should be directed to Michelle D. McIntyre, via mail, email Michelle.D.McIntyre@nasa.gov, or at 301-286-7458. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation, but a Sources Sought Notice.  

This will be a research project prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 35.007, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  NAICS code is 541710.
  
Description:  The Air Force Research Laboratory has a requirement for investigations toward identifying variability in the mechanical properties of Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) rubber with the following specifications: 

Objective
Ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber is currently utilized as the state-of-the-art matrix material in solid rocket motor (SRM) internal insulation. Test firings of SRM?s containing such insulation have revealed inconsistencies in ablative performance, which may be traced to a variety of sources. Although other components are dispersed into the EPDM matrix for this technology application, the observed variability in the measured mechanical properties of the neat sulfur-vulcanized rubber may be the root of the problem, requiring investigation. The target of this program is to identify the sources,
likely chemical in nature, causing the irreproducibility in observed tensile properties of EPDM rubber, setting the stage for further structure ? ablative property relationship studies.

Description of Work
The request is for a one-time service contract that will provide non-personal services for all labor, tools, materials, and facilities to test EPDM through thermal and mechanical methods, both in the uncured and cured states (requiring compounding with sulfur). AFRL/PRSM and the contractor shall hold regular teleconferences to track the progress of the program. The contractor shall compound EPDM with sulfur through appropriate techniques as necessary (Brabender, Banbury, milling, etc.). The contractor shall measure the thermal properties of uncured and sulfur-cured EPDM through thermal analysis such as, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), targeting the observance of glass ? rubber transitions as well as any crystallization and melting properties for each test sample following mechanical testing, noting that ethylene content may be tracked through this type of characterization. The contractor shall fabricate test coupons of EPDM (virgin and sulfur-vulcanized) for tensile measurements and provide AFRL/PRSM with the test specimens at the conclusion of the program effort. Mechanical testing shall follow industry standard guidelines such as, ASTM Standard D638. The contractor shall monitor the sulfur-vulcanization kinetics of EPDM through viscometry and/or thermal analysis techniques. A final report will be provided to AFRL/PRSM at the conclusion of the program effort. 

This work will consist of the following:

Meet with AFRL (online or in person) to define material, testing matrix, and deliverables.
Estimated Delivery: Two (2) weeks after contract award

Submit report, give presentation (online or in person) to AFRL on research activities.
Estimated Delivery: Eight (8) weeks after contract award

Submit final report detailing all research activities conducted on the program.
Estimated Delivery: Sixteen (16) weeks after contract award

SHIPPING FOB DESTINATION EDWARDS, AFB CA 93424

<DESC>Background Information The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is in the process developing a design for the Ares I Launch Vehicle Upper Stage. The Ares I architecture requires that the Upper Stage provide a method of separation from the First Stage after the First Stage has expended its usable energy and prior to the start of the Upper Stage Engine. The current design solution uses Space Shuttle Booster Separation Motors BSMs (renamed Booster Deceleration Motors (BDMs) to more accurately describe their Ares I application) to separate the Ares I First Stage from the Upper Stage. It has been suggested that a separation system using struts driven by compressed gas might be a preferable alternative with cost, additional payload mass to orbit, reduction in hardware and operations complexity, and safety cited as potential advantages. NASA is now conducting a trade study to provide a systematic approach to defining and developing the gas strut separation process and to objectively compare it to the baseline BDM separation process in order to identify the preferred separation process. The current concept for the gas separation struts would have the struts driven by the adiabatic expansion of a compressed gas within a cylinder surrounding the strut and its associated piston. The strut extension would be of order six feet and the struts would be required to exert a force of approximately 7000 pounds.  This effort is part of the NASA Design team responsibilities and, therefore, is not considered to be a duplication of requirements that have been solicited for under the Upper Stage Production Request for Proposal (RFP NNM07181505R).  Information provided will be used internal to NASA and will not be included in the evaluation process for the Upper Stage RFP. RFI Requested Response Topics The objective of this RFI is to solicit information related to the commercial availability and/or current design efforts of thrusters or actuators with performance capabilities similar to the gas struts described above. With regard to commercial availability, NASA requests input describing commercially available devices with similar performance capabilities (to include customer references for commercial sales, product description sheets, delivery lead time, and pricing data).  With regard to current design efforts for such devices, NASA requests input related to activities currently underway geared towards developing thrusters or actuators similar to the gas struts described above (to include design objective, modeling capability in support of design activities, and expected new product availability date). Response Instructions Any information obtained will be used by NASA for planning purposes. NASA will use the information obtained as a result of this RFI on a non-attribution basis. Providing data or information that is limited or restricted for use by NASA for that purpose would be of little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited. No information or questions received will be posted to any website or public access location. NASA does not plan to respond to the individual responses. This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only and the Government does not intend to award a contract at this time.  As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3. All responses shall be provided in MS Word, Powerpoint, or Postscript document format via electronic media. Responses should not exceed 25 pages. Please submit responses no later than May 25, 2007, to NASA/MSFC Procurement Office, Attn: PS41/James D. Young, Contracting Officer, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL 35812. Additional questions should be provided to James Young via e-mail: James.D.Young@nasa.gov.  Note that due to the sensitive nature of the black-out period for the Upper Stage RFP, although not directly linked, all comments and questions shall be processed to the above point of contact and no other NASA/MSFC personnel shall be contacted.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-AB133F-06-CN-0133
<RESPDATE>051807
<ARCHDATE>06022007
<CONTACT>Paul Reed, Contract Specialist, Phone (206) 526-6034, Fax (206) 526-6025, Email paul.j.reed@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOAA intends to negotiate a sole source extension to Contract Number AB133F-06-CN-0133 with the University of Washington for the continuation of research on salmon reproduction, imprinting, and genetics research. Via the proposed extension, the contract period of performance would be extended until May 31, 2008.  

There are three tasks required for this requirement:

1) Assist with determining the effects of natural and artificial light on timing of spawning and development of secondary sex characteristics in sockeye salmon and effects of body growth on age 3 maturation and ovarian development in spring Chinook salmon.  The following are required for this work: a) collection of tissues and plasma from experimental fish, b) measurement of plasma and pituitary gonadotropins, plasma sex steroids, and melatonin by radioimmunossay, c) measurement of pituitary ovarian gene transcripts  (e.g. genes in the apoptosis cascade, vitellogenin receptor, zona radiata proteins, gonadotropin and growth hormone receptors, steroidogenic enzymes) from experimental fish by real time PCR, d) suppression subtraction hybridization cloning of ovarian genes, e) quantification of body color and morphology using digital cameras, color meter and computer image analysis, f) computer image analysis of gonad development from histological sections of gonads from experimental fish, g) ultrasound to identify maturing fish, and h) statistical analyses and interpretation of data collected from experimental fish.  All analyses will be conducted at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center.   Sockeye rearing will be done at the University of Washington, Big Beef Creek facility.
2) Assist with laboratory, behavioral and field  assessments of olfactory imprinting by sockeye and Chinook salmon. To determine the critical period(s) for imprinting, juvenile salmon are being exposed to known odorants at key developmental stages and are being tested subsequently for development of long-term memories of these odorants.  Results of these experiments will be important to determine the critical periods for imprinting for the offspring of captively-reared fish destined for release into natal rivers or lakes. The following are required for this work: a) maintain odor exposure equipment and odorants, b) conduct routine sampling of fish for tissue and physiological assays to assess smolting and imprinting, c) assist with behavioral assessments of imprinting in experimental stream channel, d) conduct electro-olfactogram (EOG) assessments of imprinted sockeye salmon and e) assist with molecular assessments of imprinting f) assist with carcass and redd surveys to assess imprinting and homing success of Chinook salmon.
3) Assist with assessing the degree of early male maturation of salmon in hatcheries in the Columbia River basin and determining effects of growth and photoperiod on the rate of early male maturation in Chinook salmon.  This includes field trips to hatcheries and dams in Washington, Oregon and Idaho where fish are sampled for blood and gonads.  In addition, controlled laboratory experiments are conducted in a research hatchery in Seattle where the effects of photoperiod, temperature and feeding rate on early male maturation are assessed.  The following will be required for this work:  a) conduct routine sampling of fish for tissue and blood to assess male maturation, b) organize and assemple of field sampling gear, c) collect and organize data on fish size and culture conditions, d) assist with experimental set-up and fish culture in the experimental hatchery, e) assist with analysis of plasma hormone levels including androgens and insulin-like growth factor I.
Deliverables will be in the form of data collected from experiments and summarized in a FY08 annual report. The Government intends to negotiate a sole source extension to the existing contract with the University of Washington (UW), as it is believed that the UW is the only source with such unique expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the work. All interested concerns must submit documentation in writing demonstrating the capability, expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the necessary work to Contracting Officer Paul Reed at Paul.J.Reed@noaa.gov no later than May 18, 2007. It is requested that all submittals and inquiries be submitted via email to the stated address. See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement to determine interest and availability of 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, and Small Business concerns for hydraulic dredging at Westport  River & Harbor, Massachusetts.  The NAICS code for the work described below is 237990 with a size standard of $18,500.00.  The estimated cost range is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. The Westport River & Harbor is located in the Town of Westport, Massachusetts, on the shore of Buzzards Bay, bordering Rhode Island.  The harbor is a coastal estuary with an inlet opening south into Buzzards Bay between a barrier beach to the east and head land to the west.  The harbor has general depths of 8 to 15 feet below mean lower low water (mllw), while the entrance has a controlling depth of about 6 feet below mllw.  The proposed project consists of dredging an entrance channel, 9 feet mlw by 150 to 200 feet wide, through the inlet to Westport Harbor (from RN12 to GC-23).  The channel would connect deep water in Buzzards Bay with deep water in the harbor, a distance of about 9,700 feet, of which only three areas, totaling about 4,550 feet of channel r equire dredging.  Disposal site is a 2,400-foot long section of Horseneck Beach located between 1,600 and 4,000 feet east of the inlet.  The required approach is to place about 19,500 cubic yards of clean sand onto the Town-owned portion of Horseneck Beach , and working the material on the beach to establish appropriate beach profiles.  A one-foot allowable over depth and side slopes of one on three are included in the channel design and quantities.  Sediment Characteristics:  The results of grain size analy sis indicated that the proposed dredged material is composed of approximately 99% sand.   The sandy material is dominated by fine and medium grained sands.  Sea State Conditions:   from October through January, northerly winds result in calm waters inside marker RN-8.  Strong southerly winds may produce 5 foot swells.  Outgoing tide may produce currents up to 4 knots.  Storm events may result in swells greater than 5 feet.  The environmental dredging window for this project permits work from October 1, 2007  through January 31, 2008. Interested contractors should submit a capabilities package to include the following: business classification size (e.g. 8(a), HUBZone, etc.), projects similar to the work described above, and a list of equipment.  Responses should be limited to five pages .  This is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  Responses are required no later than 25 May 2007.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of En gineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN: David Dilks (CT-C).  Firms interested shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.  The government will not pay for any material provided in respons e to this market survey nor return the data provided.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.

<SOLNBR>W91YU00507DRPGWN
<RESPDATE>060507
<ARCHDATE>08042007
<CONTACT>Bill Kinney, 253-968-1869
<DESC>A.	General Information TRICARE Northwest and Pacific Regions, a military integrated delivery network comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announce a Request for Regional Incentive Agree ment Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Drapes and Gowns.  The major facilities in the area include, but are not limited to, Madigan Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Bremerton, Naval Hospital Oak Harbor, Bassett Army Community Hospital, Elmen dorf Air Force Base Hospital, Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB. The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.   This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, or be in pro cess of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor (Cardinal Healthcare).  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Pri me Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with the possibility of t hree (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is November 2007.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The award will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.     Point of Contact: Pat Cordier, RN, MSN, CNOR at (253) 968-0898; Email - Patricia.Cordier@us.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required The Northwest and Pacific Regions are seeking product line items in the category of Drapes and Gowns, such as gowns, general drape packs, barrier sheets, mayo covers, and table covers. The estimated total volume in both Regions for this product line is over $588K annually.  This forecast is based on historical Prime Vendor sales for a 12-month period. At the request of the Northwest and Pacific Regions Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, M SDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address), (3) product literature and your answers to the technical/company questions/crit eria below to Patricia.Cordier@us.army.mil and Cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil no later than 4:00 p.m. (Pacific Standard Time), June 5, 2007.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.   This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical/company criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POCs that their initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Regions via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.   D.	 Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Northwest and Pacific Regions. They are the deciding offici als for this initiative.  Phase I.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The CPT/TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  All technical/company criteria ar e weighted equally.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.   Phase II.  Clinical evaluation of vendor samples will proceed as follows: a.  The Lead TRBO will request a sample set from vendors to be sent directly to participating Phase II facilities.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities in a non-patient car e setting. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the designated MTFs.  Samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated MTFs by COB, 4PM local time, on the 30th business day after the notice to ship, which will be delivered via email. Vendors f ailing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   The evaluation could end at this stage based on industry response and clinician satisfaction that products meet the stated evaluation criter ia.    b.  If necessary, the CPT will down-select to the top two vendors and will proceed with an evaluation of samples on select patient care units using the same criteria used in the initial sample set evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the designated MTFs.  Samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated MTFs by COB, 4PM local time, on the 30th business day after the notice to ship, which will be delivered via email. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like format with a 1-7 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Slightly Disagree; 4 = Undecided; 5 = Slightly Agree; 6 = Agree; 7 = Strongly Agree). The CPT has set a threshold of 4.1 for acceptability of products for standardization. Clinical/performance results lower than 4.1 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration at each stage of the clinical evaluation.  All clinical cr iteria are weighted equally.  The results of the clinical evaluation of the products is the most important factor to the TPRB when making a best value decision.  The TPRB considers pricing a secondary factor.  Once the final phase of clinical evaluations is determined, those remaining vendors will be asked to submit best value pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northwest and Pacific Regions. Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods  (not to exceed a total of 5 years).  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.   Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purpose s of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables ; 2) based on the quoters responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has, or is obtaini ng a DAPA for the items; 4) the quoter has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal Healthcare, the Prime Vendor for the Northwest and Pacific Regions; 5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in t his standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the quoters information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration .) 1.

<SUBJECT>X -- Trailer Lease
<DESC>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The reprocurement will comprise of a base year and four-one year options.  

Description:  14 office trailer units, 1 guardhouse and 1 latrine.  Different sizes:  12FT x 56FT, 
24FT x 60FT, 56FT x 96FT and 12FT x 66FT.

Maintaining the incumbent prevents substantial non-recoverable duplication of cost (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A)).  Additional costs would be incurred due to the teardown and removal of the existing trailers, in addition to the installation and modifications of the new trailers to meet operational configuration objectives.  It is not reasonable to expect to recover these costs through competition and it is not reasonable to pay for requirements the Government has already paid (i.e. communication and security configuration modifications, delivery and set-up fees).  In addition, maintaining the incumbent precludes unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B)).  It is required that this procurement involves no disruption in continuity or cohesion.

All Contractors who may be interested in providing a quotation regarding a pending procurement for Hydraulic Power Units for the NIST Force Deadweight Machine are encouraged to attend.  If interested in providing an offer; however, are unable to attend the conference, the contract specialist should be notified via email at jennifer.lohmeier@nist.gov. 

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333995 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is 100 percent set-aside for small businesses.  Only interested small businesses may submit a quote.  In accordance with the Non-Manufacturer Rule, to qualify under a small business set-aside, the distributor and the manufacturer must qualify as a Small Business manufacturer under the NAICS code identified above. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for two (2) each, Hydraulic Power Units for the NIST Force Deadweight Machine to be used in the Manufacturing Metrology Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***

498 kN (112 klbf)-
The hydraulic power unit must be a turnkey replacement for the existing hydraulic power unit (HPU) that has powered the weight manipulation system in the NIST Force Lab at the 498 kN deadweight machine (DWM) for over 40 years.  The HPU must be designed and built to current hydraulic standards and to the requirements dictated by the remainder of the existing components that comprise the operational DWM.  The HPU will power a vertical single-acting hydraulic piston ram/cylinder that incrementally lifts up to 112000 lbs of steel weights under manual or automated control. 

The successful vendor is expected to demonstrate the ability to furnish a fully compatible, yet fully modernized replacement HPU that will integrate with the existing control panels or integrate with original electronic controls as shown on NIST drawings, whichever is more beneficial to the government. 

The HPU must:
?	Meet all requirements of a turnkey system for the 4.45 MN DWM and 
                  498 kN (112 klbf) DWM
?	Be compatible with the DWM operating pressures of up to 1200 psi
?	Be physically sized to fit through existing door frames of the mechanical rooms
?	Be compatible with existing seals in the main lifting ram
?	Retain cylinder return under gravity flow, with rate control and manual emergency unload valve
?	Be compatible with existing manual and automated control systems; careful examination of NIST drawings and hardware will dictate design of new HPU 
?	Include owner-serviceable filters
?	Be capable of controlling any oil leakage at ram piston rod end by allowing return to reservoir
?	Show operating capability over temperature range of approximately 10-35?C


Special Provisions:
Based upon market research, NIST has determined that the required hydraulic power units (HPU?s) are not available as off-the-shelf items but should be readily obtainable from qualified hydraulic engineering vendors as custom-assembled replacements for the existing HPU?s using various components that are readily available.  The HPU?s must meet the requirements noted in the Force Lab specification sheet and successfully integrate with the existing force deadweight machines.  

Pre-Bid:
The deadweight machines are available for examination to allow all potential vendors full access to the NIST deadweight machine installation points in order to resolve any technical details or other installation issues.  The conference will include the NIST COTR and the Force Lab engineer.  The successful vendor will provide a turn-key bid estimate to NIST based primarily upon the site visit and machine examination.   

A SITE VISIT shall take place on Wednesday, May 30, 2007 at 10:00:00am Eastern Standard Time.

Attendees shall convene at NIST, Engineering Mechanics Building 202, Room 221, 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, Maryland.

Potential Offerors are strongly encouraged to attend site visit.  

SITE VISIT REQUIREMENTS:

A.	BACKGROUND:  To reduce the threat of exotic pest introductions in the United States, a primary responsibility of APHIS is to manage pest risks at the point-of-origin, i.e., off-shore.  One of the most damaging agricultural pest groups threatening U.S. agriculture is the Tephritidae family of fruit flies. APHIS IS cooperates with foreign countries in surveillance and control programs of economically significant fruit flies including the Mediterranean fruit fly, Medfly, and the Mexican fruit fly.  Other exotic and destructive fruit flies of immediate risk to the U.S. from Latin America and the Caribbean include West Indian fruit fly, sapote fruit fly, guava fruit fly and South American fruit fly.  Because of increases in trade, the United States is also threatened by pests from the Old World.  The identification of sources and pathways of plant pests including these fruit flies is important for formulating efficient exclusion and mitigative strategies. 

To further safeguard U.S. agriculture, APHIS has implemented the Offshore Pest Information Program, OPIP, which involves the placement of safeguarding specialists overseas.  The primary task of these specialists is to gather relevant pest and disease information which is necessary to identify the risk potential of commodities exported to the United States.  

B.	OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE OF WORK:

To develop and provide training to safeguarding specialists and other IS personnel on emerging pest and disease situations; how to determine what information to report for the purpose of enhancing performance and ability to gather relevant pest information that will be useful for evaluating and mitigating the threat of invasive species entry into the United States; to help develop and maintain guidelines and areas of focus for the safeguarding specialists and other IS personnel on the safeguarding program; to provide input on the maintenance on the OPIS pest list.

Sole Source is based upon this vendor being the only manufacturer/vendor able to satisfy this requirement:

Sole Source also based upon the authority FAR 6.302-1(2)(C)(ii) which allows for sole source purchase if it is considered a follow-on contract for the continued development of a system when the award would result in duplication of cost. Interactive Northwest, Inc (INI) originally developed the specified software to provide client self service, automated call routing (customized for the JPPSO), call back messaging, expected wait time and proactive justifications that are currently running on three JPPSO servers.   The software is a combination of INI proprietary application software and customized application software developed specifically for this use.  An alternate contractor would need to be an Avaya (the telephone system provider) certified Independent Software Vendor (ISV) and be a business partner of Nuance Communications authorized to re-sell maintenance contracts for the underlying speech recognition and text-to-speech software used in the JPPSO system.  An alternate contractor would also need to procure rights to the source code for INI proprietary software and obtain and understand the custom software and speech recognition grammars developed specifically for the JPPSO system.  The cost for contracting with an alternate vendor that could meet these requirements would greatly exceed the cost of this maintenance contract.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format under Simplified Acquisition Procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items; and FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NLM-07-111-MJK.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis.  This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511.

It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate for professional Information Technology (IT) services to assist NIH in providing critical enhancements and support for NMS Imaging brand name software previously acquired by NIH to support the NIH System for Executive Records and Correspondence Handling (SERCH) and the NIH Enterprise Ethics System (NEES).  NIH conducted an extensive evaluation of the following alternative approaches in choosing the software platform for SERCH and NEES:  (1) Utilize commercially-available software products, (2) Perform in-house custom development of the required software applications, and (3) Utilize existing software applications developed by other Government agencies.  Following the evaluation of available commercial software products, cost, and system requirements, NIH selected NMS Imaging (formally National Micrographics Systems), 12041 Bournefield Way, Silver Spring, MD 20904 to provide its commercial products (including proprietary support services) as the software platform for both NIH enterprise systems.   

In 2003 NIH began developing SERCH as an integrated system to serve the NIH Executive Secretariat needs for records management and executive correspondence handling.  SERCH operates on NMS brand name software that enables document management, workflow, full text searching, format conversion, digital signatures, and records management.  SERCH represents the integration of 15 software applications across 22 servers.  The contractor will be required to review the SERCH process maps, work queues, permissions and integration between the 15 software applications.  To accomplish the work requirements for SERCH, NIH estimates that a total of approximately 1,000 labor hours will be required during a 12-month period beginning approximately June 1, 2007, and 1,000 labor hours during one successive 12-month option period.   NIH estimates that the effort will require expertise from the following labor categories:  Senior Systems Design Engineer, Systems Design Engineer Manager, and Executive Project Manager.  

In 2005 NIH began developing NEES as a secure web-based workflow management system using the NMS Imaging brand name software platform to support the NIH Ethics Program that assists NIH staff with meeting the required statutes and regulations governing the ethical behavior of Executive Branch employees of the Federal Government.  NEES is a comprehensive automation of the NIH Ethics Program that takes into account various business policies and processes at NIH through the utilization of numerous related applications and data stores.  NIH requires professional IT services to further develop the NMS Imaging software platform for NEES to include the following:  (1) Electronic submission of all ethics-related reports and requests along with supporting documentation; (2) electronic review and approval of all ethics-related reports and requests, along with supporting documentation; and (3) electronic tracking and reporting of all ethics-related reports and requests, submissions, reviews, and approvals as well as other related activities associated with the Ethics Program at NIH.  To accomplish the work requirements for NEES, NIH estimates that a total of approximately 480 labor hours will be required during a 12-month period beginning approximately June 1, 2007, and the following additional effort during three successive 12-month option periods:  Option Period 1 (approximately 600 labor hours), Option Period 2 (approximately 460 labor hours), and Option Period 3 (approximately 320 labor hours).  NIH estimates that the effort to support NEES will require expertise from the same labor categories required by SERCH.  

The purchase order term will be from approximately June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2008 followed by three successive 12-month option periods.  The following clauses and provisions cited herein are incorporated by reference into this solicitation and may be obtained from the web site http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/SAP/sap.htm:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial Items (September 2006), and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items (February 2007).  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation ? Commercial Items (January 1999), also applies with the following three evaluation criteria (listed in descending order of priority) to be included in paragraph (a) of the provision:  (1) Experience and expertise of the proposed staff in providing professional IT services to support integrated Federal enterprise systems similar to SERCH and NEES that utilize NMS Imaging software platforms, (2) Experience and expertise of  the company in providing professional IT services to support integrated Federal enterprise systems similar to SERCH and NEES that utilize NMS Imaging software platforms, and (3) Past performance in supporting Federal enterprise systems that utilized NMS Imaging software.  An award will be made to the offeror who represents the best value to the Government based upon the three technical evaluation criteria that are listed in descending order of priority and, when combined, are more important than price.  Offerors must submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications ? Commercial Items (November 2006), with their offers.  The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders ? Commercial Items (March 2007), applies to this acquisition as well as the following clauses cited therein:     FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (June 2003), and FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer ? Central Contractor Registration (October 2003).  Please contact the contracting office if you have any questions concerning this solicitation.

Sources having the ability to provide the professional IT services described above shall provide clear and comprehensive information supporting their experience and expertise, past performance, and pricing.  An offeror?s response should not exceed 25 pages.  Any questions can be submitted to Maxwell Kimpson, Contract Specialist, at (301) 496-6546.  All information received will be considered as part of a competitive acquisition.  RESPONSES ARE DUE BY 4:00 PM LOCAL PREVAILING TIME ON MAY 21, 2007, AND SHALL BE SENT VIA E-MAIL TO: kimpsonm@mail.nlm.nih.gov .

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS TO PROVIDE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED TO THIS SOLICITATION. 

Question 1:  Is there an existing program that has been offered within the last two years?  
Answer 1:  No

Question 2:  Paragraph 7.1.6 requires that each learning team (of up to 8 participants), be provided an assigned facilitator.  This implies that, with up to 25 students per cohort, three (3) or more contractor facilitators will be required for each course delivery.  Is this true? 
Answer 2:  Yes 

Question 3:  In addition, according to the provided schedule cohorts overlap for one week (two cohorts are being trained at the same time).  Does this mean that for those weeks, six (6) or more facilitators are required?  Or, can three facilitators be assigned to move between the two simultaneous cohorts?  
Answer 3:  Yes three facilitators can move between cohorts if this does not affect quality, efficiency and reduces costs to the Government.  Any time that small groups are working independent from the cohort a facilitator is required.

Question 4: Paragraph 7.1.3 specifies 8 cohorts, as does the period of performance and the provided cohort schedule.  However, paragraph 7.1.7 specifies ?Cohorts 4-10? as option periods.  Are there 3 base and 5 option cohorts, or 3 base and 7 option cohorts?
Answer 4:  There are 3 base cohorts and 5 optional cohorts.

Question 5:  Paragraph 14, PRICE PROPOSAL requests a firm fixed price ?per cohort.?  Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 are designated as base cohorts, and Cohorts 4 through 8 are designated as optional cohorts.  Paragraph 16 (b) states that the Government will evaluate option prices separate from base prices.  Therefore, is the Government seeking 8 separate prices (one for each of the 8 cohorts, separately priced), 1 price (same price for each of the eight cohorts), or 2 prices (one price for each of the base cohorts, and a 1 price for each of the optional cohorts)? 
Answer 5:  The Government requires that each Cohort be priced separately.  One price for each base and option cohort.
 
Question 6:  Paragraph 18 states that proposals are due electronically by 3:00 EST May 15, 2007, with a hard copy follow-up.  Is the hard copy also due to MSHA by 3:00 May 15, 2007, or may it arrive later?
Answer 6:  As long as the electronic proposal is received by the due date and time, the hard copy proposal can be delivered within 3 business days later.

 
Question 7:  Paragraph 7.1.9 states that the contractor shall administer an individual 360 degree feedback instrument to each participant.  360 feedback instruments require the participation of supervisees and supervisors of the participant.  Is our price to include the coordination of the assessment administration (i.e., coordination with the participant for the identification of supervisors and supervisees, administration of questionnaires to them, compilation of results, and so forth), or, will the contractor provide the instruments to the MSHA who will see that they are administered?   Please note that implementation of a 360 instrument will required considerable lead time before each Module 1 to conduct all the required 360 assessment activities. 
Answer 7:  The Government anticipates using an Internet based 360 degree assessment and including supervisors of participants. MSHA is not going to conduct or administer the questionnaires or the instrument.  Offerors should allow enough lead time to perform the 360 assessment prior to each cohort.

Question 8:  Can I mail my response rather than email?  Some of my documents are from sources that can't fit the 12 point font?
 Answer 8:  We recognize that some elements of a proposal can not meet the 12 point font request.  If there are elements of the proposal that are provided in a different font that enable you to better present your proposal, that will be acceptable.  
 
Question 9:  Will all documents have to meet the 12 point font?
Answer 9:  Only his written proposal that is created in WORD.  Other documents can be sent in the font they are created in.
 
Question 10:  Could you please clarify the term COHORT?
Answer 10:  A Group, in this case of participants that will complete the subject training as a unit. 

Question 11:  Are the participants already supervisors/Managers?
Answer 11:  Yes for the pilot and maybe for the rest of the groups.

Question 12:  How much time will be allowed for pre-assessment activities.
Answer 12:  For the first group that will depend on when the contract is finalized with respect to the June 24 start date.  In respect to the remainder of the cohorts, the proposal should address when and how the pre-assessment activities are to be conducted to meet the already established schedule.  

Question 13:  Is there flexibility in the timing of the response date and the start date of training?
Answer 13:  The start date at this point in time is set at June 24th.   Unless an amendment is issued the proposal shall comply with that date.


Question 14:  One of the 360 tools we are considering is the Office of Personnel Management?s (OPM) 360 tool.  If we go with this tool we can include it in our technical proposal but we understand MSHA will have to contract directly with OPM for use of the tool thus preventing us from including it in our price proposal.  Would this arrangement be acceptable to the government?  
Answer 14:  The proposals shall contain a 360 tool in which the contractor is able to obtain and administer.  MSHA will not be contracting with other agencies for the 360 tools.  MSHA is not providing Government Furnished Property for the 360 Tool.  


Question 15:  What specific 360 instrument does the agency want to use? 
Answer 15:  The agency does not have a specific 360 instrument designated.  It is the contractors responsibility to choose an instrument that complements the program they propose.

Question 16:  Are the training materials to be considered a deliverable?
Answer 16:  YES

Question 17:  Has MSHA contracted for or produced a leadership development program like this in the past? If so, who developed the program? 
Answer 17:  There have been other supervisor training and leadership classes but this is the first time that MSHA has contracted for a leadership development program.  
   
Question 18:  Has DOL selected an off the shelf LDP program they want to use?  
Answer 18:  NO 

Question 19:  Is there a firm that has already done an assessment to determine the leadership development needs of the organization? If yes, by whom? Are the results available for use in program development? 
Answer 19:  The agency has done it?s own needs assessment.

Question 20:  Are the dates for the cohort sessions firm? 
Answer 20:  YES 

Question 21:  Is there a customer review of the session content other than the pilot/cohort 1?

Answer 23:  Service Motivation, Conflict Management, Accountability, Decisiveness/Problem Solving, Organizational Awareness
Question 24:  Is the assigned facilitator referenced in 7.1.6. a member of the cohort program?or is the assigned facilitator someone provided by the vendor?  
Answer 24:  Provided by the Vendor
Question 25:   Can you please confirm our interpretation of item 7.1.7.  The intent is to have the first week or each cohort program overlap the week of another cohort which is in progress.  Does this mean that the vendor would be providing six facilitators that week?  Three for each cohort (as references in 7.1.6.). 
Answer 25:  Yes
Question 26:  Do you have an already designed 360 feedback instrument?  If not, would you preference to have the vendor design one?or to use on that is commercially available and aligned with the ECQs? 
Answer 26:  No, MSHA does not have a 360 feedback instrument.  It is the contractors responsibility to propose a tool that will be ready for implementation upon submission of their proposal and that complements the proposed training program.   
Question 27:  Are mentors already available or do you need a process for identifying them? 
Answer 27:  Mentors are available
Question 28:   What is your desired delivery for post session evaluations?  Item 7.1.15 states 5 days.  Item 9.2 suggests 10 days. 
Answer 28:  7.1.15 is referring to the evaluations that have been completed by participants 9.2 is referring to the evaluation form itself,  The form shall be provided within 10 days of the contract award for Agency review and approval.

Question 29:  Are the training days flexible?  Can we suggest alternative dates based on our availability?

Answer 31:  The first Cohort is the pilot.

Question 32:  What does MSHA intend to do in the May 15 (when proposals arrive) to June 3 timeframe (kickoff of the first cohort) to ensure the highest quality program? This time seems tight.  How will you get the vendor up to speed, ensure participants get adequate notice re: any pre-session correspondence/prep, ensure that a senior leader is available and that mentors are ready for their role, etc. 
Answer 32:  The start date has been moved to June 23.

Question 36:  While we can propose a design and content to meet MSHA?s needs we would prefer to modify what is proposed after some sort of needs assessment.  Should we propose a process for doing so or do MSHA have additional information re: training needs? 
Answer 36:   MSHA has identified needs through feedback from previous training and through skill gap assessment conducted by DOL.

Question 41:  What do you mean by "Total Small Business?"  
Answer 41:  The purpose of a Total Small Business Set Aside is to award certain acquisitions exclusively to small business concerns. A ?set-aside for small business? is the reserving of an acquisition exclusively for participation by small business concerns. A small business set-aside may be open to all small businesses. A small business set-aside of a single acquisition or a class of acquisitions may be total or partial.  More information can be found in FAR part 19 

Question 42:  What is the difference between "Total Small Business" and "Very Small Business?" 
Answer 42: The Very Small Business Set Aside used to be a program managed by SBA but expired in 2003.

Question 46:  Your solicitation states: "The contractor shall provide a one half day mentoring development session for the mentors that MSHA will identify and match to each participant. MSHA will schedule the mentors to receive their one half day training and work with their mentees the remaining one half day toward the later part of each participant?s 1st week of training. (i.e. interact with trainers/facilitators, work with mentee in the development of ILDP, develop a mentor/mentee agreement)" Please explain the "?" May we assume that in addition to the three facilitators we will need to provide a fourth facilitator to conduct the concurrent training for the mentors?  
Answer 46:  That would be your call.  If all facilitators are working with the small groups during the time you are training mentors the answer would be yes.  The reason for the ?, is that when FBO converts the information and post the solicitation if there are any characters that is does not recognize unfortunately it places a ?.  The information was clarified in the above question and written out in words instead of fractions.

AMENDMENT 1: (Technical Question)

Question 1: 

I am working on a bid for the above referenced RFQ, there is a technical issue with how the specs are written - the height of the shelter is taller than the overall allowed height of the tower shown (7 feet).  We manufacture XXXXXXX Units for the military already - can we quote something standard for this application?

Answer 1: 

In response to the question above the Government does not feel that the specs are incorrect. As stated in the posting, the trailer must have an integrated weather-proof, climate controlled full enclosure measuring approximately 60? (length) x 76? (height) x 84? (height) for the operator and rack equipment. Therefore, both the fold over and shelter have approximate heights of 7 feet. 

Please note: that the ? after the numeric measurements stands for inches.
