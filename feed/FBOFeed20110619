DoD dependent elementary, middle and high school complexes supporting a population of 1,430 students, and 48 additional facilities to include a Child Development Center and 2 Youth Centers. In order to meet the requirements of DoDI 6055.6, Enclosure 3, for response time/staffing and in order to safeguard DoD facilities against fire and to provide adequate response time on emergency calls, a one-company satellite fire station is necessary. The Fire Department's current operation does not meet DoDI 6055.6, Table E-3.T. "Minimum Level of Service Objectives". The HQ Department of Army approved implementation of the DoDI 6055.06 Manpower Model also drives the need for additional firefighter manpower as well as additional space to support this projected manpower increase.<br><br>POINT OF CONTACT:<br>Barbara Walker 817-886-1161<br><br>US Army Corps of Engineers  <br>819 Taylor Street, Room 2A19<br>Fort Worth, Texas 76102-0300<br>
