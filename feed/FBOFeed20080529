<DESC><p>This is a Pre-Solicitation Synopsis; not a request for competitive proposals. The purpose of this program is to establish a domestic production capacity for the production of light-weight ammunition cartridge casings using an ultra-high strength, melt-processable, isotropic, amorphous, rigid-rod, self-reinforcing, polyparaphenylene material. The final product must be capable of being deployed for use in conventional, already fielded weapons systems. An initial product line will establish light-weight casing production for the .50 caliber machine gun while subsequent lines will establish production capacity for the 7.62 mm and 5.56 mm light-weight ammunition casings. The Title III Program Office, Air Force Research Laboratory, Manufacturing Technology Division (AFRL/MLM) intends to award an Assistance Instrument or a contract, as appropriate, on the basis of less than full and open competition for this requirement to MAC, LLC, 13091 Road G, Pearlington, MS 39572. Under the authority of Title III Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office is contemplating this procurement to establish a domestic production capacity for the production of light-weight ammunition cartridge casings using an ultra-high strength, melt-processable, isotropic, amorphous, rigid-rod, self-reinforcing, polyparaphenylene material compatible with conventional weapon systems. This project requires a domestic, merchant-oriented supplier of light-weight ammunition casings. The definition of domestic source as defined in the Defense Production Act of 1950 is as follows: "A business concern that performs in the United States or Canada substantially all of the research and development, engineering, manufacturing, and production activities required of such business concern under a contract with the United States relating to a critical component or a critical technology item; and that procures from business concerns (described as above) substantially all of any components and assemblies required under a contract with the United States relating to a critical component or critical technology item." For the purposes of this contract, the Government defines a merchant supplier as a production source which manufactures, supplies, and supports the use of its products by customers who represent end users independent of either internal or sister organizations. In light of this requirement, a Title III merchant supplier of light-weight ammunition casings may not, as a matter of policy, place restrictions or limitations on which customers may buy or how they may subsequently use its products. The period of performance for this procurement is anticipated to be 21 months. The anticipated set of requirements for the development of light-weight ammunition casings under this effort will be: (1) A weight reduction, measured against traditional ammunition casings, in the range of 25% to 30%, (2) Acceptable performance of the finished ammunition casing products under Hot (120O to 125 O), Cold (-45 O to -50O) and Ambient (room temperature) conditions as well as the ability to withstand "cook-off"(rapid firing which may cause the polymer to melt) conditions at temperatures in the 300O to 400O range, (3) Optimization of the injection molded production process for light-weight ammunition casings production, (4) All other ammunition performance (range, lethality, rate of fire) criteria at least equal to, but preferably better than, comparable products, (5) Independent assessment, evaluation, validation and DoD acceptance of the final ammunition product and (6) delivery of a detailed strategic business plan that formally assesses and verifies the military and commercial demand for light-weight ammunition. To meet the government's cost and schedule requirements the contractor must have; established access to a raw material source capable of meeting all the characteristics for an ultra-high strength, melt-processable, isotropic, amorphous, rigid-rod, self-reinforcing, polyparaphenylene material; demonstrated leadership in the industry; existing merchant-oriented light-weight ammunition production capacity for light-weight ammunition; demonstrated experience in design, development, inspection, and testing of high performance light-weight ammunition; demonstrated acceptance and credibility among ammunition customers; demonstrated business viability. Additional phases may be awarded based on defense requirements, anticipated demand, and availability of funding. The government intends to issue an award for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR6.302-1(a)(1), "Only One Responsible Source." MAC, LLC is considered as a sole source provider for this effort due to the existence of patent rights and control of the raw material source by Solvay, LLC, of which this control is extended to MAC, LLC based upon their exclusive supplier agreement, making the basic raw material available from only one source (FAR 6.302-1(b)(2)). Offerors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. This documentation shall specify the offeror's area of expertise and experience. It shall include a demonstrated capability to produce light-weight ammunition cartridge casings using an ultra-high strength, melt-processable, isotropic, amorphous, rigid-rod, self-reinforcing, polyparaphenylene material capable of being deployed for use in conventional, already fielded weapons systems. The documentation shall demonstrate that the manufacturing capability is domestic as defined in the Defense Production Act, and that the company has a light-weight ammunition product merchant supplier orientation. In addition, the documentation shall include a listing of products and services currently offered as a light-weight ammunition product merchant supplier, along with market share in each area, including military customers. Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered. Direct all questions pertaining to this acquisition to the contracting point of contacts listed above in this announcement. Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). All responsible sources may submit information, which shall be considered by the agency. See Numbered Note 22. <br /><br />Other business opportunities for the Air Force Research Laboratory are also available at www.fedbizopps.gov and at http://www.wpafb.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=6790. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact or Program Manager identified in the announcement.</p>

A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other<br />restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Request for Written Quotation will be issued. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) intends to make multiple awards for the provision of residential re-entry programs for inmates at one or more pilot site institutions. .Proposals will be accepted from any Offeror.  Offerors are to submit proposals that include secular (i.e., non-religious) programming in nine life skills areas.  In the event that prisoners may prefer programs that include a religious perspective, an offeror, in carrying out the secular program objectives, may submit a proposal that contains religious programming, in addition to its independent secular programs.  The secular programming must be of equal quality to any programming with religious content that might be offered to the prisoner participants.  Failure to include a secular program that is of equal quality to any program with religious content will result in the proposal being ineligible for award.
The pilot sites are as follows:  Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Seagoville, Low Security; Federal Correctional Complex Beaumont, Low Security facility; United States Penitentiary Hazelton, Secure Female Unit; FCI Fort Dix, Low Security; FCI Edgfield, Medium Security; and FCI Tucson, Medium Security.  Prospective Offerors shall be permitted to submit separate proposals for any or all of the pilot site locations.  The BOP reserves the right to place contract award(s) for services at up to six of its designated pilot institutions based upon evaluation of proposals.   Each site will accommodate only one program.  

The purpose of the residential re-entry program shall be to facilitate personal behavioral and attitudinal change for the participating inmates, and thereby reduce recidivism through promoting the virtues of productive work, respect for others, self-discovery, responsibility and accountability.  In addition, it is expected that this program will also contribute to overall prison safety and management.  The program shall encourage re-connection with family and community, and the development of healthy and productive habits of living.  The program shall match inmates with community organizations or similar support groups at their release destination, for the purpose of personal mentoring and enhancement of participants opportunities for successful community reintegration (i.e., employment, housing, avoidance of recidivism, etc.).

There are nine interdependent program areas linked to the goals of community reintegration and reduction of recidivism: 1) daily living; 2) mental health; 3) wellness; 4) interpersonal skills; 
5) academic; 6) cognitive; 7) vocational; 8) leisure time; 9) character.  The goals/areas are intended to form a framework for a program that will foster successful rehabilitation and reduction of recidivism by reinforcing the skills necessary for integration or reintegration into the release-destination community.  The contractor shall develop a curriculum that demonstrates consistency with program goals and outlines how the contractor plans to incorporate program components that foster growth in the nine program goal areas.  The contractor shall provide sufficient staffing to cover a rigorous schedule, comprised of daytime and evening programming during the week and on weekends for up to 130 inmate participants per site.

The BOP intends to conduct pre-proposal site visits at each of the six pilot site institutions.  Finalized pre-proposal site visit dates and times will be set out in the cover letter of the  solicitation document when posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, or will be issued as an Amendment to the solicitation after it is posted to FBO.

The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 624190, and the requirement is issued on an unrestricted basis.  A Firm-Fixed Price type contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods is anticipated for each pilot site.  The BOP anticipates the following regarding the periods of performance: Base Period of performance shall be from date of Notice to Proceed through 12 months; Option Period One shall be from 13 months through 24 months; Option Period Two shall be from 25 months through 36 months; Option Period Three shall be from 37 months through 48 months; and Option Period Four shall be from 49 months through 60 months.

<DESC>The Bureau of Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center, on behalf of the United States Access Board, has the need for hotel rooms and a meeting room with accessibility requirements, audio visual equipment, and Food and Beverage Services in Washington, DC for its 2009 Board Meetings.    

The Access Board is a very small Federal agency with a governing Board of 25 people.  The President appoints thirteen members of the Board for four year terms.  By law 6 of these Public members must be people with disabilities.  There are 12 Federal members designated by statute.  These are assistant secretaries from major Federal agencies such as the Department of Justice, Department of Transportation, Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services and the General Services Administration.  The Board meets five times a year in Washington, DC.  It needs hotel meeting space and sleeping rooms for about 13 Board members from outside of Washington.  The meeting dates are set in the Boards regulations, and can only be changed with the consent of the Board under extreme circumstances.

2009 Access Board Meeting Dates - The Access Board needs to book a hotel for its meetings in 2009.  The meeting dates will be forthcoming.

Hotel Requirements -- The Access Board requires a hotel that the meeting dates, which will be forthcoming, can provide:

1.  Meeting Room.  A meeting room of approximately 1300 to 2000 square feet with will accommodate a U shaped meeting table seating approximately 25 people.  There must be room for additional seating of approximately 30 people around the perimeter of the room.  

2.  Audio Visual Equipment.  The Board will require the following items of equipment for audio visual support of all of its meetings; 
a.  computer projector, 
b.  speaker phone, 
c.  projection screen, 
d.  sound mixer, and speakers, 
e.  Approximately 25 table microphones.  

3.  Food and Beverage Service.  The Board desires to provide a continental breakfast, coffee service throughout the mornings, on the three meeting days.  The Board will have two buffet luncheon meetings. The food service will be for 40 people.  

4.  Sleeping Rooms.  The Board will need a total of 14 sleeping rooms for a period beginning the night before the scheduled meeting, and ending on the night of the last meeting.  Within the 14 rooms the Board requires a total of 6 wheelchair accessible rooms.  Of those 6 rooms, 3 rooms must be equipped with a roll-in shower, and 3 must be equipped with a bath tub with grab bars.  One of the rooms with a roll-in shower must have a door to an adjoining room (That adjoining room does not have to be accessible.)  The wheelchair accessible rooms must meet the ADA accessibility standards as closely as possible.  The ADA Accessibility Standards are located at the following web address:  http://www.ada.gov/reg3a.html#Anchor-11482

Locations and Access Requirements -- The Access Board has developed explicit guidelines for choosing a hotel for its meetings.  These are:

1.  The hotel, its public areas, meeting rooms, sleeping rooms, and public restrooms, must meet, as closely as possible, the current ADA accessibility Standards.  In addition, the hotel must have done an excellent job of integrating the access into the general design of the hotel.  For example, there cannot be a separate entrance that is accessible for people with disabilities but rarely used by people without disabilities.  Access Board staff will make a determination whether the hotel most closely meets the standards. 
2.  The hotel must have sleeping rooms that are accessible to people who are deaf, or the hotel must have the required portable equipment. 
3.  The hotel should be in the central business district of Washington, DC. 
4.  The hotel should be within 3 blocks of a METRO station. 
5.  The hotel should offer government per diem rates or be reasonably priced. 

The Access Board staff must be able to make a site visit to the hotel to determine whether or not it meets the accessibility criteria, design criteria, and other requirements. 

Consistency in Hotels -- The Board has found that it is easier to meet consistently in one or two hotels in the DC area.  The hotel staff becomes familiar with the Boards access needs.  

Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to set-aside for a small business concern the purchase of an updated patient education video describing the risk and benefits of ACAM2000 vaccine.   In the aftermath of the anthrax attacks of 2001, efforts were undertaken to prepare a response for various bioterrorism agents.  Because smallpox had been eradicated, the only vaccines available were no longer licensed and would have to be given as part of an Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol.  However, if there was a need to conduct mass vaccination clinics in a short time, videos would be required in order to more quickly impart the risks and benefits of the vaccine under the terms of the IND.  In 2003, a production company was hired to create these videos.  They were distributed to all public health agencies in the United States to be used in the event of a smallpox attack.  In 2007, a new smallpox vaccine was licensed.  While it will no longer require the amount of information as the IND product, public health agencies still need a way to easily explain the risks and benefits of the vaccine in the event mass vaccination is required. This contract is to hire a production company to create a new version of this patient education video.  The full solicitation document shall be uploaded within 24 hours and it is your responsibility to retrieve the solicitation from herein, thereafter.  The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at this site for downloading when issued. No telephone requests of the solicitation will be accepted or entertained. No questions will be questions will be answered via telephone.  No hard copy of the solicitation package will be mailed. All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to award to 8(A)  

10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a brand name only commercial purchase order in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14, 22 Nov 06. The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 423450 and the size standard is 500 employees. The government intends to award a name brand commercial delivery order to Goldbelt Raven LLC, using the existing ARMEC (Army Research Medical Equipment and Consumables) contract. The requirement is to purchase: 1 each FF450+R / W-Table, 1 each Visupac 481 W ZK-5&F2018, 1 each Review 4.2/Node Lock License and 1 each Gold Plan No PM Zeiss Visupac.  These items will require identification adhering to DFARS 252.211-7003 (http://farsite.hill.af.mil).  The justification for the brand name requirement is as follows:

 a. The Ophthalmology clinic has a requirement for a new Fundus camera in order to provide faster quality treatment to our patients with glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal disease, retinal detachment, macular disease, retinal vascular occlusion, and optic nerve disease.  

Carl Zeiss Meditec designs and manufactures the combo camera system.  After extensive research of available cameras it was clear that Zeiss represented the latest technology on the commercial market . The Zeiss FF450 Fundus Camera has outstanding optical components and operating convenience for both observation and documentation.  The highly corrected optical system of the universal 3-angle camera, reveals even the finest structures in a new light-an absolute must for reliable diagnosis. Carl Zeiss is the only maker of this camera system.  The camera system interfaces with the nine existing Zeiss diagnostic machines already located in the ophthalmology clinic.  When ophthalmology diagnostic equipment interfaces with other machines the very best diagnosis is rendered because those machines are talking to one another.  In order to increase our current patient load well into the future, the Zeiss camera system offers the only viable tool to meet government needs.

b. The manufacturer (Carl Zeiss attn:Mr. Guy Shultz 925-486-7473) states that no other camera system would work with existing equipment in the clinic.  The requiring activity has performed market research and looked at three other camera systems.  The Canon CR-DGi, the Topcon TRC 50 EX and the Nidek 3 DX. None of the cameras researched will interface with equipment already used in the clinic.  To do that the camera would need its own equipment.  If bought this equipment would increase new expenditures well over $100,000.00  The Zeiss camera has been thoroughly researched by our physicians for familiarity and interfacing capabilities. 

c. The commonality between the new Zeiss camera system and the existing equipment and doctors familiarity with Zeiss camera systems  made it the first choice  to meet the governments needs.  It met all requirements that the physicians were looking for.  The clinic will permanently save time and money by purchasing the Zeiss camera for its interfacing capabilities alone.  Also Carl Zeiss service staff would service all machines manufactured by them with factory trained service reps.

<DESC>Posting (Brief Abstract):  Market Survey Capability Assessment for FIRS.The FAA has a requirement for the continued operation, maintenance and support of the FAA Interfacility Radar Simulator (FIRS).  This is a continuation of effort currently performed by JVN Communications Inc.  Note: JVN owns the intellectual property rights to all the FIRS applications.  FIRS is a large complex integrated hardware system utilizing approximately two million lines of executable software code. FIRS is a digital recorder, scenario generator, analyzer, and playback system. It incorporates an application that compiles hardware and software products together using an operating system and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment onto an x86-based platform. FIRS can be transported to FAA and vendor facilities to thoroughly analyze air traffic control automation systems in all ATC domains. FIRS maintenance and enhancement requires detailed knowledge of the exact as-built construction of the hardware and software of both operational and support systems.   The specific objectives of this public announcement are as follows:	To inform interested industry of this planned FY08 FIRS support acquisition. 	To assess the feasibility of procuring FIRS support via a competitive acquisition. In order to determine if FIRS support can be acquired competitively, the FAA is interested in determining whether industry can satisfy this requirement without reliance on the existing supplier's proprietary data rights/processes. 	Should a competitive approach to award this requirement prove unfeasible the FAA will procure this requirement via a follow-on sole source award to the present supplier.	To assess the feasibility of competition limited to small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or 8(a) certified firms. 	To solicit industry feedback on the attached Statement of Work.Interested vendors are requested to provide the following:1.	Capability Statements not to exceed 20 pages that address the following: 	Type of services provided by your company,	Size and type of services provided by previous contracts. Elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance history, 	Number of years in business,	Capabilities to provide the services described in the referenced SOW without reliance on present supplier's proprietary data rights/processes.   This must address the following:A.	The FIRS product line includes the STARS Inter-facility and Radar Simulator (SIRS), Transportable FIRS (TFIRS), Portable FIRS (PFIRS), Rack Installed FIRS (RIFIRS), Radar Box (RBX), Graphical Scenario Generation Tool (GSGT), and Simulation Driver Radar Replacement (SDRR).   The contractor shall provide all necessary qualified personnel, services, and software tools to satisfy FIRS maintenance and enhancement requirements consisting of management, engineering, application software, firmware applicable to Input/Output hardware, design, production, installation, integration, testing, reporting and documentation.  B.	Develop and provide scenarios and scripts needed to support all  STARS (including STARS Light), CARTS platforms:  ARTS-IIIE, ARTS-IIE, ARTS-1E; ongoing upgrades: Terminal Automation Replacement Program(TAMR) at Minneapolis, Chicago, Denver and St. Louis Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), Automatic Dependent Surveillance- Broadcast (ADSB) at Louisville, KY,  and future CARTS and STARS product improvement TFOS activities.C.	Provide data extraction, data reduction and analysis tools for the FIRS product line as needed.D.	Provide FIRS the capabilities to exert dynamic message control (a.k.a. dynamic simulations) in support of Terminal Field Operations Support program activities and enhancements.E.	Provide the capability to simulate record and playback future surveillance sensors sources such as Multilateration for Airport System Detection Equipment (ASDE) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) to support TFOS activities. Enhance and modify JVN Communications' proprietary source code as necessary to support these capabilities.F.	Provide the capability to generate scenarios using Terminal adaptation such as radar and approach plate data using a graphical interface. These scenarios should be exportable to SDRR for use in TFOS activities. Provide enhancements as required by TFOS supported programs.
2.	Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc). Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses. 3.

The machines will be acquired by the VA National Acquisition Center (MAC), Hines, IL. One each is to be installed at the VAMC Minneapolis, MN, the VAMC Sioux Falls, SD, and VAMC Des Moines, IA. The new MRI at Minneapolis is intended to be placed in renovated space. The new MRIs at both Sioux Falls and Des Moines will be placed in new additions, with renovations to accommodate tie-in to and matching of historical existing buildings. The MRI units being purchased are Phillips 3.0 Tesla Achieva and it is the VA's intent to incorporate the patented Phillips "ambient experience". The delivery date for the equipment is still pending.  NAICS Codes 541310 or 236220 apply depending if the Prime Contractor is an A-E firm or a construction firm. THIS IS A 100% SET-ASIDE FOR SERVICE- DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS in accordance with the Veterans First Contracting Program (PL 109-461). It is in the intent of the government to publish all necessary Request for Proposal (RFP) documents on or about February 28, 2008. Solicitation documents will be available at www.fbo.gov.

The Government desires that offerors provide two (2) copies each required submission for each Phase.  In accordance with FAR 28.101 Phase II will require the submittal of a Bid Guarantee of 20% of the price bid. Only separate bid bonds are acceptable for this construction project.  NOTE: Plans are now underway to re-locate the VISN 23 Contracting Office in the near future.  An amendment will be issued if this re-location occurs before Phase II proposals are due (Phase II proposals are estimated due mid-June 2008). Any questions regarding this announcement must reference VA-263-08-RP-0123. The Government will not undertake extraordinary measures to identify responses without this reference.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the electric distribution system for the Duluth Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located at Duluth International Airport (IAP), to Minnesota Power.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. Minnesota Power (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The electric system being privatized is described as follows: The 148th Fighter Wing (FW) is located at Duluth International Airport in St. Louis County, Minnesota, seven miles northwest of downtown Duluth. The main base occupies approx 136 acres on the northeast corner of the airport. The base proper has a total of 40 buildings.  The Guard also has control on additional properties surrounding the airport.  These include POL/DRMO (21 acres, 10 buildings); BX (2 acres, 1 building); PMEL (2 acres, 2 buildings);Transient Quarters (2.7 acre, 1 building); WSA (16.7 acres plus 78.5 acres QD, 8 buildings); and ARFF (approx 10 acres, 1 building).  Normal base population is approximately 400 personnel but surges to approximately 1100 periodically each month during drill sessions.  The main base occupies approx 153 acres on the northeast corner of the airport.  The entire base has a total of 61 buildings.  Normal base population is approximately 320 personnel but surges to  approximately 1100 occur once each month during drill sessions.  The Duluth ANGB Electrical Distribution System is Y Delta configured 13,800 volts fed overhead from an H-frame through a three phase pole mounted disconnect.  The system then splits into two sets of cutouts.  After the cutouts, the high voltage lines run underground. One cutout feeds the aircraft parking facilities through a 480 volt pad mounted transformer with the high voltage line continuing underground to building 221 to feed a 208 volt pad mounted transformer. The other cutout feeds the rest of the base. This feed runs underground to two substations and 16 pad mounted transformers. The distribution system contains approximately 10,255 linear feet of wiring of which approximately 98% is underground in conduit or direct bury. Wiring was installed from the 1950s to the present with approximately 66% being installed between 1984 and 1995.  Overall condition of the distribution system is considered to be good with two projects planned, one to upgrade the system and one to increase capacity at one building. A majority of the high voltage system was upgraded in 2004 to complete with above ground termination pedestals.  There is one Off-Installation site that is maintained by Minnesota Air National Guard CE, the Weapons Storage area.  It is fed overhead into the compound to a 300KVA pad mounted transformer.. This off-installation system is also considered to be in good condition with no known deficiencies. Base (to include the Weapon Storage area) is metered for service from one master meter located on Haines Road at the entry section of Haines Road and Airport Cargo Road. Competitive proposals were requested in 2000 and no offers were received.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Normal base population is approximately 400 personnel but surges to approximately 1100 occur once each month during drill sessions.  The water system does have recognized deficiencies that were identified by the City of Duluth who supplies their water. In 1999 the base water system failed an overall hydrostatic test. One leak was repaired in the system, however a follow up hydrostatic test has not been performed.  The Duluth ANGB water distribution is a dead-end system design. The Base water service enters the main base from the south at one location using a 6-inch service line at approximately 45 psi and feeds a two 60,000-gallon underground water tanks.  A second water service line travels through the East and North side of the base serving a fire suppression system in B220, a domestic feed into B212, a domestic feed into B202, and 6 fire hydrants. This line is currently owned by the City of Duluth.  The distribution system contains approximately 6,560 linear feet of water piping which is mostly ductile iron pipe (76%) and some copper pipe (24%). Pipe sizes range from 1 inch to 8 inch in diameter and are buried approximately 7 feet underground and considered to be in average condition. The age of the system components range from 1950 to present.  The One of the underground water tanks was constructed in 1952, and the other in 2004.  The two are tied together and have common automatic water level controls.  There is one pump station in building 230 that was constructed in 1972 and is approximately 216 sq ft in size. The pump station contains 4 centrifugal pumps that are each rated at 250 gpm and each is driven with a 15 hp electric motor.  The station has automatic controls, with local audible alarms.  The pump house station was upgraded in 1992 to install pressure switches, and again in 2003 to relocate and upgrade the power control panel and replace the pressure vessels. The distribution system also contains 18 fire hydrants, 1 post indicator valve, 29 gate valves, and has a .80 MGD capacity operating on at 85 psi.  There are no backflow devices, wells, or meters associated with this system. Point of Demarcation will start at the down stream side of the City of Duluth Comfort Systems master water meter located 100 feet south of building 230 central heating plant current City of Duluth water line connection.  Ending Points of Demarcation will be within 5 feet of each building and will include the service shut-off valve.  The main base Wastewater Collection System is approximately 95% gravity feed collection with three lift stations with pumps and approximately 5% force mains fed through 2-3-inch mains. The force mains serve  with four lift stations with duplex pumpspumps.  There are four separate points where the base system connects to the city owned mains.  The city main collector line leaves the base at one central point on the south side of base. There is no treatment facility located on the Duluth ANGB. Wastewater is treated at the Western lake Superior Sanitary District treatment facility. The system contains approximately 5300 linear feet of active piping,  which ranges between 3 inch to 8 inches in diameter, is mostly PVC and vitrified clay, and is buried at an average depth of eight feet. There are 26 manholes with watertight covers with depths ranging from 8 feet to 15 feet and one that is 25 feet.  Manholes are constructed mostly of concrete (80%) and about (20%) are brick.  There is no treatment facility located on Duluth ANGB.  Lift stations are considered to be in good condition.  Lift stations were installed in 1982, 1985, 1992, and 2006 with automatic controls and with audible or visual local alarms.  Overall Condition of system is considered to be good.  There are no known sags and inflow/infiltration is minimal.  Age of the system components ranges from 1950 to the present.  There are currently no upgrades or additions to the system in progress.  Points of Demarcation are from the three manhole connections located on the last 1000 feet of the city collection main and from one Y connection on city main and within 5 feet of each serviced building or clean-outs, when available, or to point of connection on oil water separators.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2000 and no offers were received.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This requirement is for the procurement of a construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the masonry restoration of the Fa?ade of the William J. Nealon Federal Building at 235 N. Washington Avenue in Scranton, PA. The ornamental terra cotta cornice on the building is in disrepair and in need of some restoration.  Water has infiltrated the structure and caused the support steel to rust and expand causing cracks and irregularities in the cornice itself.  The cornice will be incrementally removed and if possible salvaged.  While removed, the support steel will be replaced and repaired where applicable.  Portions of the fa?ade will be repointed and some dutchman repairs are necessary.  Window lintels will be repaired or replaced as necessary.  Large cracks in the masonry will be repaired and associated masonry units will be replaced in kind.  Decorative metal flag poles attached to the fa?ade will be restored to their original appearance.  Sections of the fluting on the marble engaged columns have chipped away and also need some repairs.  The front entrance steps will need some repointing and the railings will be repaired.  Once everything is addressed, the exterior of the building will need a thorough cleaning.  A micro-abrasive cleaning system will be employed to achieve the level of cleanliness established in the mock-ups.  Where a biocide/antimicrobial agent indicated will also be utilized. The successful firm must have previous experience with similar size and scope of construction projects with particular emphasis on terra cotta cornice of the building.  GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: projects with masonry restoration and terra cotta replacement of an office building (Governmental, Courthouse, or Institutional) that have been completed in the last 10 years of approximately $1 million dollars or more.  The contractor's personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project. The approximate duration of the contract is 300 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed.  The estimated cost of this project is between $1,000,000.00 to $3,000,000.00. Award will be full and open competition.  The procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.  Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, current projects, Team Organization/Communication qualified/experienced personnel and on their price proposals  The acquisition process shall consist of two phases: Phase 1- Receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing selected drawings and a draft RFP with the technical evaluation factors.

This phase also consists of receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents (a competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer).  Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award without discussions.

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS RESERVED AS AN (Competitive 8A SET-ASIDE), ONLY ELIGIBLE COMPANIES SHOULD RESPOND TO THIS REQUEST.
This activity will build on Successful Investment in Knowledge Management & Communications and Training activities to promote adoption of good practice in microenterprise development activities. 

Specifically, whereas USAID?s Microenterprise Development office has successfully supported knowledge sharing, learning, communications and training activities through its Accelerated Microenterprise Advancement Project (AMAP) IQC.  This support will now be combined into a single contract that will coordinate learning across the entire office portfolio, including AMAP, the Implementation Grant Program and its associated learning networks, the FIELD-Support Leader With Associates, and the Grants Under Contract mechanism, as well as other current and future microenterprise investments. T

The intent is to extend current learning activities, expand into new areas of learning and knowledge sharing, and gain economies of scale and synergy by combining all microenterprise learning activities in a single contract covering the full range of microenterprise activities.

The Performance-Based Contract to be awarded will aim to increase the application of microenterprise good practice by engaging the global microenterprise community in capturing, disseminating and applying microenterprise knowledge, though web-enabled collaboration, in-person and distance/virtual training, seminars and conferences, learning networks and peer assistance among USAID partners, communications efforts aimed at broad dissemination of innovations, and other activities. 

As a result of this activity, USAID expects to see improved program design, implementation and results yielding improved performance of financial markets in extending financial services to poor and very poor clients; and programs that increase microenterprise productivity through policy reform that removes barriers to (and lowers costs of) entering the formal sector, and through enterprise initiatives that increase the competitiveness of small and microenterprises in productive value chains. The KMD activity is expected to work in tandem to the maximum extent feasible with other ongoing and planned USAID development activities.

<DESC><p>The Satellite Control and Network Systems Group intends to modify a contract for the following effort: a) development of a Unified S-band (USB) nominal HPA and associated National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) filtering/control and status software, b) procurement of five (5) nominal production USB HPAs, procurement of one (1) dual band HPA (enhanced Space-Ground Link Subsystem (SGLS) HPA and nominal USB HPA), c) up to five (5) nominal SGLS and USB dual band HPAs for the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN). The proposed action will be awarded under a cost plus award fee contract. The proposed action will be awarded to the existing Satellite Control Network Contract (SCNC) F04701-02-D-0006, which is a cost plus award fee contract for satellite and network control services and support. The reason for this notice is the original ordering period on the SCNC contract expired due to Government funding constraints and the complexity of the RBC HPA development.
<p>The RBC HPA is a key component in the RBC system design, allowing for amplification and transmission of AFSCN modulation formats in the L-band uplink frequency band of 1.755-1.850 Gigahertz (GHz) (SGLS Commanding, SGLS Ranging, Binary Subcarrier Commanding, and Pulse Code Modulation [PCM]/Phase Modulation [PM]), as well as modulation formats specific to USB in the S-band uplink frequency band of 2.025-2.110 GHz (USB Subcarrier Commanding and USB Tone Ranging). Both frequency bands must support an Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) of 104 dBm for nominal and 110 dBm for enhanced configurations. The AFSCN is the Department of Defense's (DoD) primary network for supporting launch and early orbit operations. The AFSCN provides telemetry, tracking, and commanding capability, mission data dissemination and processing, and is one of the nation's primary high-powered networks for emergency recovery of space vehicles.</p>
<p>The AFSCN currently consists of legacy Automatic Remote Tracking Stations (ARTS) and is undergoing a modernization to state-of-the-art tracking stations (known as the Remote Tracking Station (RTS) Block Change (RBC)). There are five (5) RBC projects currently on contract requiring new SGLS/USB HPAs. The new RBC HPA will replace the legacy ARTS SGLS HPA. The award of this contract action is vital to ensuring AFSCN compliance with dual band capability per DoD directive by January 2011. This new RBC HPA will include, but not be limited to, the following deliverables:</p>
<p>1. Development of a SGLS/USB Dual Band HPA Capability<br />2. Project Management<br />3. Project Systems Engineering<br />4. Configuration Management<br />5. Procurement<br />6. Production<br />7. System Integration, Assembly, Checkout, and Shipping<br />8. Test and Evaluation<br />9. NTIA Test<br />10. Data and Documentation<br />11. Integration Logistics Support<br />12. Installation<br />13. Environmental Engineering Compliance</p>
<p>The value for these supplies and services is limited to the acquisition of the following: USB nominal HPA and NTIA filtering/control and status software development, procurement of five (5) nominal production USB HPAs, one (1) enhanced SGLS/nominal USB HPA, and up to five (5) nominal dual band HPAs estimated at $35,000,000.00 combined total.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to determine whether potential offerors exist who are capable of achieving program objectives within acceptable cost, performance, and schedule parameters. Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc. (HTSI) was awarded the Satellite Control Network Contract in December 2001 and is presently on contract for the procurement of production SGLS RBC HPA units. The Government anticipates a sole source award to the incumbent contractor, HTSI, but all responsible sources may submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) that will be considered by the Government. The expected contract award date for the USB HPA development unit is the fourth quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2008. The expected contract award date for the follow-on procurement of the various HPA configurations is the first quarter of FY 2010.</p>
<p>Responsible sources interested in this notice may submit their SOC electronically, with documented evidence of their ability to meet all technical, performance, and schedule requirements, no later than 16 June 2008. Responses from small and small disadvantaged business are encouraged. Submit SOCs to:</p>

<p>Capt Gregory Smith, Government Project Officer, (310) 653-1399, gregory.smith@losangeles.af.mil.</p>
<p>Refer to the four (4) attached technical documents: RBC Requirements Document (RD), Performance Specifications for the Core Electronics (RNG-PRF-0004), Performance Specifications for the Antenna (RNG-PRF-0004), and Item Specification for the RBC HPA (SCNC-05-SEI-0893). The SOC package should provide a summary of capabilities and past experience with the following: 1) Cover Letter: Provide company name, mailing address, contracting and technical POCs, CAGE code, and statement of business size classification. Small business offers please note that NAICS 541712 (1,000 employees) applies. The cover letter must be signed and dated by an authorized officer of the organization; 2) Executive Summary: Describe the proposed program, objectives, and approach for the development of the USB pre-production unit and procurement of the various HPA configurations; 3) Program Plan: Describe in detail the planned technical approach and how the approach will be executed. Include a concept of products, techniques, methods, materials, and a milestone chart identifying capability to meet requirements; 4) Past Performance: Outline relevant and recent experience in HPA development and integration for both SGLS and USB at a nominal EIRP of 104 dBm and enhanced (SGLS only) at 110 dBm. Include a list of Points of Contact (POCs) with phone numbers and email addresses; 5) Personnel and Facilities: Describe ability to provide qualified personnel and facilities to work at the appropriate security level; 6) Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate: Explain cost savings expected due to realization of learning curve; 7) Provide a detailed description of how integration with the existing Honeywell RBCs and SGLS HPAs, without redesign of the RBC system, will be accomplished, performed, implemented, and tested.</p>
<p>All responses must be signed, scanned, and submitted by e-mail to the POCs listed below in MS Word or PDF format, conform to 8.5 x 11 inch pages, with no smaller than 12 point font. All responses are to be unclassified and should not exceed fifty (50) one-sided pages. The Government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation.</p>
<p>All submitted SOCs will be evaluated to establish a potential pool of sources capable of supporting this requirement; small businesses that submit a SOC should indicate if they are interested as a potential prime contractor and/or a subcontractor. The Government will then determine the extent of competition based on, but not limited to, availability of responsible qualified sources and their integration capabilities. This determination is solely within the discretion of the Government. The selection of one or more sources for determination of competition will be based on an evaluation of each offeror's SOC to determine the overall merit of capability. The SOCs will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 1) Ability to develop and deliver the nominal USB HPA and associated NTIA filtering/control and status software by November 2009 and integrate with a comparable SGLS HPA; 2) Ability to develop and deliver dual band (enhanced SGLS and nominal USB) HPA by January 2011; 3) Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV); and 4) Ability to meet requirements and performance parameters as listed in the attachments.</p>
<p>DECLARATION: Submit questions to the e-mail addresses below. This notice is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, or to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.</p>

<DESC>The US Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency is issuing this announcement on behalf of US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Risk Management Agency (RMA) to SEEK INFORMATION from sources that have the capability of demonstrating the following: 
The ability to perform an analysis of the potential long-term implications of climate change for the crop insurance program administered by the Risk Management Agency for the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) and delivered by authorized insurance providers (AIPs).  

This analysis would use the assessments from the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07285.pdf and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap4-3/sap4-3-draft3.pdf to establish sound estimates of expected future conditions.  Key components of such an analysis may include: (1) realistic scenarios of future losses under anticipated climatic conditions and expected exposure levels along with a baseline (no impact due to climate change or no climate change) scenario; (2) the potential budgetary implications and consequences of these scenarios for FCIC and AIPs; and (3) potential mitigation options that the FCIC might use to reduce exposure to loss. 

The development of a program impact model is required to express potential climate changes as changes in mean or variance of crop yields or shifts in production areas.  The model should have the capability to analyze the budgetary impacts climate change (or baseline) scenarios have on FCIC and on AIPs under current terms, or potential alternative terms, of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) between the FCIC and the AIPs.
Studies have indicated that global temperatures are increasing and are projected to continue increasing.  Warming is expected to change rainfall patterns.  Increased drought is possible in many regions of the U.S. while rainfall could increase in other areas.  The frequency and severity of extreme events are also expected to increase.  These factors could have a major impact on U.S. agriculture and consequently, FCIC and AIPs.

Interested firms must possess the following:

Skill and experience in conducting studies of climate change and how climate change will affect insurance.  Skill and experience in modeling climate change scenarios and their resulting impacts on an insurance industry.  The ability to quickly analyze the present crop insurance infrastructure, including the standard reinsurance agreement requirements, as well as, the information contained in the Synthesis and Assessment Product 4.3 The effects of climate change on agriculture, land resources, water resources, and biodiversity.  The ability to use this analysis to formulate a plan to conduct a study of climate change and how it affects the crop insurance infrastructure.  

Interested firms may provide proof of previous studies of climate change and it affects on insurance by providing copies or extracts of these studies.  Interested firms should also provide a sample plan of how they would approach a study of climate change using the information contained in SAP 4.3 and its affect on the crop insurance infrastructure. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS 
Interested vendors must submit in a separate cover page their point of contact information along with their Tax Identification Number (TIN), Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNS) and business size. Please ensure that your firm is currently registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov) and is currently certified in the Online Representation and Certification (ORCA) (https:// orca.bpn.gov). 

CLOSING DATE:                     TIME: 4PM Central Standard Time 
Interested vendor shall submit their information via email to Contract Officer Steven Prado at: steven.prado@kcc.usda.gov by the closing date of this RFI. If you have questions regarding this RFI, please submit your inquiries via email to steven.prado@kcc.usda.gov.

need to upgrade a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope system that is currently in our NIST laboratory. Only a microscope objective from Carl Zeiss microImaging will be fully compatible with this existing microscope system. The explanation for this is as follows: microscope objectives from different manufacturer such as Zeiss, Nikon, Olympus and Leica are often (and in this specific case) propriety to the microscope systems from that manufacture, and are not usually interchangeable between manufactures. While microscope objectives from these manufacturer may share many important primary specifications related to application and performance, a variety of secondary optical and mechanic parameters often do not match. These objective specifications are matched to the many proprietary parameters of the microscope systems from each manufacturer, and are essential for performing microscopy correctly. The specifications for the objectives needed are as follows:

 	
Magnification:  100X
Numerical Aperture:   1.4
Cover Glass Thickness:  0.17 mm
Thread Type:  M27 by 0.75
Immersion Medium:  Oil
Field of View:  25 mm
Parfocal Length:  45.06 mm
Tube Length:  Infinite
Reference Focal Length of Tube Lens:  Zeiss Infinity Color Corrected System
Flat Field Correction:  Plan
Aberration Correction:  Apochromat
Specialized Optical Properties:  DIC

Carl Ziess is the only source able to perform the entire work required.

The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order. This notice of intent is to a request for competitive quotations: however, companies that believe they can fulfill the requirement may provide a written response to this notice and provide evidence to substantiate that capability. A determinations by the government whether to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government, Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competition.

<CONTACT>Kelly A Rima, PURCHASING AGENT, Phone 303-497-3779, Fax 303-497-3163, Email kelly.rima@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). <br />The U.S. Dept. of Commerce National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) requires technical and pricing information pertaining to RF combiner/multicoupler systems for land mobile radio repeater stations that operate in the VHF range. The particular application for which the product would be used would be to combine a three-channel VHF trunked Project 25 radio repeater station onto a common single dipole antenna, or, optionally, to combine the transmitters of the trunked system onto a single dedicated transmit dipole antenna plus combine its receivers onto a separate single dedicated receive dipole antenna. Information pertaining to technical parameters, technical performance, post-purchase technical support, price, warranty, and delivery ARO is sought for a quantity of two RF combiner/multicoupler systems, each tuned to operate at the sets of frequencies listed below.
<p>The transmit and receive frequencies, in MHz, of each of the trunked radio repeaters' channels are:</p>
<p>System 1 System 2<br />Transmit Receive Transmit Receive<br />Channel 1: 172.0875 163.3125 172.1000 163.3000<br />Channel 2: 170.6000 166.0000 169.0500 162.0750<br />Channel 3: 168.6875 165.7500 166.8125 163.0000</p>
<p>A channel assignment on System 1 may be interchanged with a channel assignment on System 2, should the bidder determine that doing so will lead to an overall improvement in both RF combiner/multicoupler systems' RF performances. Bidders are encouraged to determine the best grouping of channels for their submitted design.</p>
<p>The maximum possible transmitter power from each repeater is 100 watts continuous duty cycle and all three repeaters of a system could be transmitting simultaneously. Emission designators are 8k10F1D and 8k10F1E (Project 25 Phase 1 narrowband, FDMA, C4FM, 12.5-kHz channel spacing). The minimum discernable signal of each repeater's receiver is -130 dBm.</p>
<p>The two VHF systems will be located in very close proximity to one another with 35 feet horizontal separation between the systems' antennas, hence, each system's design may need to account for additional suppression of unwanted transmissions from the other system.</p>
<p>The Institute requests that technical information for each VHF combiner/multicoupler system:<br />(1) include a block diagram of the design identifying the individual components and subassemblies that comprise it, <br />(2) identify the maximum transmitter power level, up to 500 watts, that the RF combiner/multicoupler system can sustain under long-term continuous duty cycle conditions when all three of its repeaters are simultaneously transmitting,<br />(3) include tabulated data and, optionally, graphs (minimum size 3" x 5") for each channel, prepared from either computer simulations or actual measured data, for "representative" operation at each channel's transmit and receive frequencies previously specified, showing:<br />(a) absolute magnitude of the transmitter bandpass response in dBc for each channel from repeater connection to antenna connection over a range of at least +2 MHz but not more than +5 MHz and also over a range of at least +25 kHz but not more than +100 kHz, of the channel's transmit frequency,<br />(b) transmitter bandpass phase response in degrees for each channel from repeater connection to antenna connection over a range of at least +10 kHz but not more than +50 kHz of the channel's transmit frequency,<br />(c) isolation in dBc between the transmitter ports, for each channel evaluated at the channel's transmit frequency,<br />(d) if the design combines the system's transmitters and receivers onto a single antenna, isolation in dBc between each transmitter port and every receiver port, evaluated over a range of at least +10 kHz but not more than +50 kHz of each channel's transmit frequency,<br />(e) absolute magnitude of the receiver bandpass response in dBc for each channel from antenna connection to repeater connection over a range of at least +2 MHz but not more than +5 MHz and also over a range of at least +25 kHz but not more than +100 kHz of the channel's receive frequency,<br />(f) receiver bandpass phase response in degrees for each channel from antenna connection to repeater connection over a range of at least +10 kHz but not more than +50 kHz of the channel's receive frequency,<br />(g) for receive multicoupler designs using active components, noise figure contribution of those devices in dB for each channel at the channel's receive frequency,<br />(h) isolation/selectivity in dBc between receiver ports, for each channel evaluated at the other channels' receive frequencies, and<br />(i) rejection in dBc of signals transmitted by the other companion VHF system from the antenna connection to the repeater connection<br />(4) an analysis and identification of undesired intermodulation products delivered to each channel's repeater receiver, arising from non-linear interactions between Project 25 modulated spectrum at<br />(a) each system's own transmitter frequencies,<br />(b) each system's own transmitter frequencies and the frequencies transmitted by the companion VHF system, and<br />(c) the companion system's VHF transmitter frequencies;<br />It is desired that the analysis identify what power levels in dBm of intermodulation products are delivered to each channel's receiver that exceeds the minimum discernable signal level, the source of each identified intermodulation product, and what mitigating strategies can be employed to eliminate it,<br />(5) provide for future expansion of up to five channels per system,<br />(6) for designs that recommend separate transmit and receive antennas, provide explanation as to why the bidder discourages a duplexed single antenna solution and the level of improvement that can be realized by adopting a two-antenna solution,<br />(7) 19" rack-mount mechanical design giving the overall package's physical size (HxWxD), number of equipment racks, weight, and form factor description (e.g., floor-standing 19" equipment rack(s), wall-mountable rack(s) that can be attached to unistrut affixed to concrete load-bearing walls (this is preferred), or other), and<br />(8) vendor technical point of contact in event that the Institute has questions of a technical nature about the submitted information.</p>

<p>Task 1: Otolith Analyses</p>
<p>
<p>Several investigators have documented the feasibility of distinguishing between juvenile salmonid progeny spawned by anadromous or resident maternal parents using strontium levels recorded in their embryonic otoliths (Kalish, 1990; Rieman et al., 1994, Volk et al., 2000). In salmonids, otoliths begin forming in embryos about the time a weak eye is evident, and the chemical composition of the otolith core is largely dependent upon the chemical make up of the yolk material. Since anadromous female salmon deposit yolk material in strontium rich seawater, and strontium easily substitutes for calcium in the otolith aragonite lattice, embryonic core otolith regions also show relatively high strontium levels. In contrast, assuming that the freshwater system does not have an unusually high strontium concentration, core otolith regions of resident female progeny generally have much lower strontium levels. <br />The object of this study is to determine the proportion of sampled Oncorhynchus mykiss that were spawned by anadromous or resident females by analysis of strontium abundance in their otoliths. The WDF&amp;W Otolith Lab will cast, section and prepare for analysis 220 juvenile rainbow/steelhead otoliths which will be analyzed for Sr/Ca ratios using Laser Ablation Inductively coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). A total of 220 otoliths from parr collected in 2008 will be provided by in September 2008. The otoliths from these parr will be analyzed by the following methods. <br />Analyses will take place at the Keck Collaboratory for Plasma Spectrometry at Oregon State University. Methodological details can be found in Volk et al., 2000 and unpublished reports. For each specimen transects with be conducted near the primordia and at the otolith edge to represent the maternal and freshwater signals respectively. Elevated primordia Sr/Ca values will be taken as evidence for maternal anadromy, while low values indicate resident parentage. Data will be transformed to Sr/Ca atomic ratios to make classifications of anadromous or resident maternal parentage. Results will be summarized and presented in excel spreadsheets and/or Power Point Slides and Sigmaplot graphics.</p>
<p>Task 2: Scale analyses</p>
<p>Scales collected from O. mykiss sampled from seven Hood Canal streams will be analyzed to determine age. NOAA will provide a total of 1,500 scales collected from O. mykiss parr collected during the summer of 2008 and smolts collected during the spring of 2009. Scales will be provided to&nbsp;be mounted on&nbsp; scale cards. Scale ages will be reported based on winter annulus formation in both fresh and saltwater. For example an adult spending two winters in freshwater and one full winter (two summers) in seawater would be recorded as 2.1+. The &lsquo;+' refers to rapid spring/summer growth.</p>
<p>Provide NOAA with a report that describes the methods used to generate age and maternity data and those data will be provided in electronic spreadsheets.</p>
<p>All interested parties must respond to this&nbsp;announcement by June 6, 2008. All responses must be in writing and may faxed to 206-526-6025 or email (<a href="mailto:melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov">melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov</a>) This is a simplifiued acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><p>TITLE: INDOOR POOL BULK HEAD
<p>A. General Information</p>
<p>THIS IS SYNOPSYS AND SOURCES SOUGHT for purchase titled items for Yokota AB, Japan. The purpose of this action is to synopsis to purchase INDOOR POOL BULK HEAD manufactured by NATARE CORPORATION. This is over simplified accquisition threshold, and the Government, 374 CONS/LGCBB, Yokota AB, Japan, intends to promote the full and open competition to the maximum extent possible, however, if no vendors are available in commercial open market meeting the Government requirements ( See following description), this will be a soloe source order with NATARE CORPORATION for POOL BULK HEAD under "Number Note 22". The Government will prepare a single source Justification and post it to GPE upon this synopsis.</p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required</p>
<p>Overview: Design, construct and install a moveable deck level bulkhead for a six lane 50 meter L shaped pool. The bulkhead will be used in the 50 meter competitive/lap swimming area of the pool. The bulkhead is used to separate the pool into two sections: a Federation International de Natation (FINA) sanctioned 25 meter course; an approximately 25-26 yard (non-sanctioned) course.</p>
<p>1. The bulkhead must be movable from a 25 meter mark at pool's midway point and transit to the pool's deep-end wall to allow a 50 yard course. The bulkhead WILL NOT run from the pool's midway point to the shallow end. The bulkhead will have variable buoyancy to lessen weight during movement for easy repositioning.</p>
<p>2. It is the intent of this specification to describe a swimming pool bulkhead designed to move within a pool to provide varying course lengths within the swimming pool facility to accommodate competitive swimming and related aquatics programs requirering different course lengths. Individual sections of the bulkhead shall be capable of be disconnected (disjoined) and course lengths and recreational areas. The bulkhead shall be a bilateral symmetrical dyadic truss type bridge that spans the width of the pool/ it shall be engineered to sustain the required loads to maintain the particular tolerances of the course length while providing a safe and stable platform for participants and officials. This Specification includes, but is not limited to, the following components:</p>
<p><br />1) Structure<br />2) Grating<br />3) Targets<br />4) Rope anchors<br />5) Carriage assembly<br />6) Buoyancy system<br />7) Starting platforms<br />8) Stainless steel handholds<br />9) Stainless steel nosing and bulkhead support<br />10) Timing system accessories</p>
<p><br />3. The bulkhead needs to submerge when a full 50 meter course in needed. The bulkhead should be able to re-float in less than 30 minutes from full submersion in the 11 feet depth of the pool.</p>
<p>4. The bulkhead must be able to separate into two movable sections. Each section, when separated) would equal three lane widths (approximately 27 feet long). The two sections need to interlock for positive connection when the requirement demands that a bulkhead extends the full width of the pool. When the bulkhead sections are separated a locking/anchoring mechanism will be employed to keep the free ends from moving.</p>
<p>5. The bulkhead will have a complete flow-through design for wave absorption.</p>
<p>6. The bulkhead will be made of stainless steel which shall be a 300 series stainless, intended specifically for use in a swimming pool environment and have a certified slip-resistant grating on the bulkhead's top and side surfaces for safety. The exterior cladding will be of an exterior grade PVC composite compound with an integrally machined surfacing that is ASTM 1028C slip resistant certified.</p>
<p>7. The bulkhead will be designed to eliminate entrapments from sides and underneath. Between the bulkhead on pool wall, a side tolerance of not more than 5/16 of an inch are required to keep hands and feet from entrapment or pinning. An adjustable skirt below the bulkhead is required when there is a depth of water 24 inches or less to prohibit swimming beneath the bulkhead.</p>
<p>8. The bulkhead will be designed to accommodate competitive racing lane lines for both the 25 meter and 26 yard courses.</p>
<p>9. The bulkhead will include competitive starting blocks supplied by the contractor for six lanes facing the 25 meter course.</p>
<p>10. FINA approved wall targets will be applied to the turning surfaces of both sides of the bulkhead.</p>
<p>11. The bulkhead will be designed with integral cable tray to easily accept the Natatorium's electronic timing system touch pads and to run all necessary cabling to connect the timing system for competitive events.</p>
<p>12. The designer will furnish all material, equipment, supervision, insurance, and other items necessary to provide a complete working bulkhead system.</p>
<p>13. All design drawing and specifications shall be submitted under the seal of a registered professional engineer for approval by the base civil engineer (BCE) architects.</p>
<p>14. The designer will coordinate all phases of the design and installation with the BCE.</p>
<p>15. The designer provides a ten (10) year Manufactures Warranty against defects in materials or workmanship for all components of the bulkhead. The stainless steel truss will be warranted for a period of fifteen (15) years.</p>
<p>16. Furnish all required materials for the complete installation of the bulkhead systems.</p>
<p>17. The bulkhead shall be shipped to the job site as an entire unit unless project site conditions require otherwise. Unloading and storage shall be coordinated between the Government and bulkhead manufacturer. The material shall not be stored or handled in any manner that could cause damage or deformity.</p>
<p>18. POOL Demensions</p>
</p>
<p>1) Nominal length inside pool: 50 meters + 2 centimeters<br />2) Width: 13 meters: 1 centimeter (six lane pool)<br />3) Overall Height: 1,670 millimeters<br />4) Height above water: 300 millimeters<br />5) Depth Below Water: 1,370 millimeters<br />6) Racing lane target markings: 6 per side at FINA Specifications (total of 12)<br />7) Racing lane anchors: 5 per side (total of 10)<br />8) Starting platform anchors: total 6 each Track Start Contender <br />9) Water polo goal anchors: none<br />10) Stanchion socket anchors: total 4 each (2 backstroke flag anchors on deck per FINA spec on both sides of bulk head for 25 meter course and 26 yard course)<br />11) Removable stainless steel safety guard rail: Yes, on shallow end edge of bulkhead spanning 13 meter</p>
<p>

<DESC>The CECOM LCMC Acquisition Center  Washington is seeking sources on behalf of the US Army RDECOM (Research Development and Engineering Command), CERDEC (Communications, Electronic Research, Development and Engineering Command), C2D(Command & Control Directorate), Army Power Division, Power Generation Branch, Fort Belvoir, VA and in support of the Project Manager-Mobile Electric Power, for commercial & military intelligent power management and distribution systems. The CERDEC Power Generation Branch is searching for a new family of power distribution equipment capable of transmitting electrical power between military power generating sources (see http://www.pm-mep.army.mil/for specs) and power consuming equipment.<BR><BR>The desired intelligent power management and distribution system must, at a minimum, distribute power from central power source(s) and be man-portable. In addition the intelligent power management and distribution system must operate in climatic conditions of 40 degrees to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, rain, humidity, salt spray, sand and dust, and fungus. It must be rugged enough to support field use, must be designed to be used with one and three phase generator sets rated at 120/208 VAC, 120/240 VAC, 50/60 Hz and 5 to 200 kW.<BR><BR>The intelligent power management and distribution system will be used to form a consolidated power network where the cable distance from generator set to load will be limited to 300 feet. In particular, the intelligent power management and distribution system must be capable of the functionality contained within the Armys current Power Distribution Illumination Systems Electrical (PDISE) (specifications can be found at http://www.pm-mep.army.mil/technicaldata/pdise.htm) at a minimum.  In addition, the intelligent power management and distribution system will be capable of automatic load balancing across the three phases of the input source and increased safety features to enable indication of improper grounding, and the ability to remove and replace cables without the risk of arching.  <BR><BR>The CERDEC Power Generation Branch is interested in obtaining white papers, not exceeding 10 pages in length, describing the contractors experience in design, development, fabrication, and testing of their power distribution systems, detailed specifications of their power distribution systems and organizational capabilities.  In addition, the CERDEC is interested in obtaining a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for Non-Recurring Engineering costs (Research & Development) as well as a unit cost (Procurement) for potential future government research & development contracts and procurements of intelligent power management and distribution systems containing the above mentioned functionalities.  <BR><BR>The data received in response to this RFI is for information purposes only and does not mandate or impose requirements. It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government. However, we recognize that proprietary data may be included with the information provided. If so, clearly mark such proprietary information and clearly separate it from the unrestricted information as an addendum. All responses to this market research shall be submitted no later than 14 July 2008. Extensions will not be granted due to time restrictions.

<DESC>The Southwestern Region of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is seeking information on the availability and capabilities of local small and other small business contractors who could provide supplemental assistance in handling mission requirements assigned to the Corps of Engineers in support of disaster relief efforts that could result from hurricanes hitting along the Gulf Cost and coming inland during the 2008 hurricane season. The Corps of Engineers has some pre-positioned contracts. However, this market research effort is sought to increase our awareness of, and opportunities for, local small and other small business resources that could assist in the event the existing emergency contract capacities/capabilities are exceeded, as well as to have a cadre of local small and other small business contractors who can respond to additional mission assignments in other relief areas. It is envisioned that due to the timeframe needed to respond to the emergency situations, limited competitive procurement procedures will need to be utilized for actions not issued under existing emergency contracts. Where opportunities for full and open competition exist, we will utilize that procurement process. Awards will be conducted in accordance with the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C., 5121 et seq.) and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 26.2 Disaster or Emergency Assistance Activities which provides preference to the extent feasible and practicable, to those organizations, firms, or individuals residing or doing business in the area affected by such major disasters or emergencies. As part of this process, we are seeking information about local small and other small businesses capable of providing the following services that could be required under a hurricane relief effort: (1)Blue Roofing; (2) Debris Removal, (3) Quality Assurance, (4)Mobile Home Installers. If interested, please register at http://www.swf.usace.army.mil/pubdata/hurricane/register.aspx providing the specific information requested. Failure to provide complete information will result in no further consideration of your firm. Information from other than local small or other small businesses will not be considered. Please note that this is a market survey for informational purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). There is no solicitation document available; no contract will be awarded based on this announcement; no reimbursement will be made for costs associated with responding to this announcement; and no telephone calls about this announcement will be accepted or acknowledged. All responses must be submitted to the website at http://www.swf.usace.army.mil/pubdata/hurricane/register.aspx in accordance with the instructions above. Please Note that if you registered for previous hurricane relief you will need to reregister as the database has been cleared.

<DESC>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>	Europe Region is initiating the standardization process for Orthopedic Soft Goods  Lower Back/Abdomen for its 55 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia.  Standardization for this product line, Orthopedic Soft Goods  Lower Back/Abdomen, represents new or first-time initiative for the Europe Region.  This product line includes the following products in the following sizes.<BR>1.	Lower Back Brace/Support - Sizes: Small/Short, Small/Tall, Large/Short, Small, Medium, Large, Xlarge. <BR>2.	Abdominal Support Binder - Sizes: SM/MED, MED/LG, Universal, Short, Long, 3XLong, 4XLong. <BR>Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all or comparable sizes listed.<BR><BR>	The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>	The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Hospital Heidelberg, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, 31st Medical Group Aviano, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U. S. Army CENTCOM.<BR><BR>	This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program, and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>	The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is September 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, phone: 011-49-6221-172109, and e-mail marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>	The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Orthopedic Soft Goods  Lower Back/Abdomen, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.   Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $81,613.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top ten high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR>Brace Lumbosacral w/Tall SM Side Panels	$26,860.14<BR>Support Back or Lumbar LG 36-42in Waist Elastic Posterior Foam Pad Velcro Front Closure	$15,178.50<BR>Support Back or Lumbar MED 30-36in Waist Elastic Posterior Foam Pad Velcro Front Closure	$12,885.44<BR>Support Back or Lumbar XL 42-50in Waist Elastic Posterior Foam Pad Velcro Front Closure	$8,014.42<BR>Brace Lumbrosacral w/Short LG Side Panels	$7,645.78<BR>Brace Lumbrosacral Shoulder Harness w/Short SM Side Panels	$2,220.44<BR>Support Lumbro-Sacral MED 32-42in Hip Elastic 9in Front 9in Back w/Stays Thermoplastic Insert Pocket Hook and Loop Closurex2	$1,595.88<BR>Support Lumbro-Sacral MED/LG Elastic Tapered Front 10in Back Crisscross Back & Compression Strap w/Stays Hook and Loop Closure	$1,472.80<BR>Support Lumbro-Sacral SM 32in Hip Elastic Tapered Front 11in Back 3-Buckle Cinch Straps w/Stays Posterior Pad Hook and Loop Closurex3	$1,448.40<BR>Support Abdominal Binder 4-Panel 12in 4XLong 82-94in Elastic Hook and Loop Closure	$1,184.84<BR><BR>	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>	DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address), and (3) all answers to the technical/company criteria to marcee.whisenant@us.army.mil.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well.  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>	This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. All email communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>	The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>	The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>	Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date.  Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.   After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a.  Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b.  The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any    misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.   <BR><BR>2.  Each technical/company criteria below require additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.   <BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Orthopedic Soft Goods  Lower Back/Abdomen products for single use.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined for this report as items used in the Europe Theater within a twelve month period at a minimum, a complete product line includes:<BR>a.   Usage Items:<BR>1)	Lower Back Brace/Support - Sizes: Small/Short, Small/Tall, Large/Short, Small, Medium, Large, XLarge<BR>2)	Abdominal Support Binder - Sizes: SM/MED, MED/LG, Universal, Short, Long, 3XLong, 4XLong<BR>b.   Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes (some of the sizes above within each product line may be similar or not applicable due to the item being available as a universal (one size fits all) category) and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Orthopedic Soft Goods - Lower Back/Abdomen product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) Your DAPA number is: __________________. <BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the PV Owens & Minor for distribution in the Europe Region.  (Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  <BR>4.	Vendors must provide contact information (Name, phone number, and e-mail address) for a local vendor representative in the Europe Region in response to this RFQ.<BR>5.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>6.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>7.	Vendors must provide a statement confirming their products meet the industry production and safety standards (i.e. meets OSHA Standard Industrial Classification {SIC} description for 3842: Orthopedic, Prosthetic, and Surgical Appliances and Supplies) used in manufacturing Orthopedic Soft Goods - Lower Back/Abdomen products in response to this RFQ. <BR>8.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the Orthopedic Soft Goods - Lower Back/Abdomen products including dates, duration, cause, and resolution in response to this RFQ.  Vendors will not have the opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>9.	Vendors, in response to this RFQ, must provide statement revealing all products containing synthesized polymer (plastic/rubber) are clearly labeled as latex free/safe.<BR>10.	Vendors must provide documentation of what type of securement devices your company uses for your Lower Back/Abdomen orthopedic soft goods in response to this RFQ.<BR>11.	Vendors must provide, in response to this RFQ, documentation of what type of lining your company uses for your Lower Back/Abdomen orthopedic soft goods product items.<BR>12.	Vendors must provide, in response to this RFQ, documentation that your products are designed to be worn over or under clothing.<BR>13.	Vendors must be able to ship samples necessary for evaluation via United States Parcel Service eliminating delays that occur with Europes Custom Offices.  Provide acknowledgement of this issue in response to this RFQ.  Samples required for this evaluation will be furnished by the vendors at no charge.<BR><BR>	Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using hands on evaluation of samples in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  As mentioned in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 5:00PM EST on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Vendors must forward verification (e-mail) of shipment to the TRBO.<BR><BR>	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to more acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.   <BR> <BR>	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR>1. Patient Safety - Product is durable.<BR>a. A splint or brace for the lower extremity needs to be durable due to the forces incurred with weight bearing and patient mobility.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will visually inspect the product, confirming the quality of the material used to construct the item is acceptable.<BR>2. Patient Comfort - Product is lightweight.<BR>a. The weight of the splint or brace is important for patient comfort due to the length of time the device will need to be applied.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the weight of the item is acceptable.<BR>3. Proper Fit - Product has adjustable securement devices.<BR>		a. This feature will allow proper fit to stabilize injured or diseased body <BR>                    part.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the adjustable closure device of the item is acceptable.<BR>4. Patient Comfort - Product has features to provide comfort to user.<BR>		a. The CPT will be looking for the different kinds of padding offered to 			allow for patient comfort.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will don the product, confirming the comfort of the item is acceptable.		<BR>5. Patient Safety - Product provides stability.<BR>a. This feature allows the stabilization of the body part protecting the body part from further injury.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the stability/function of the item is acceptable.		<BR><BR>	Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total  Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:<BR>1.	The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>2.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.<BR>3.	Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the government in this standardization initiative.<BR>

Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price quote submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. All email communications between vendors and the Europe Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria. <BR><BR>	The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>	The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>	Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date.  Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a.  Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b.  The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any    misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.   <BR><BR>2.  Each technical/company criteria below require additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.   <BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Orthopedic Soft Goods  Knee products for single use.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined for this report as items used in the Europe Theater within a twelve-month period. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:<BR>a.   Usage Items:<BR>1)	Knee Support Sleeve/Slip-on w/ open & closed patella - Sizes: Small, Medium, Large, XLarge. <BR>2)	Knee Support Hinged Slip-on - Sizes: Small, Medium, Large, XLarge. <BR>3)	Un-loader (Osteoarthritis) Knee Brace - Sizes; Small, Medium, Large XLarge, 2XLarge. <BR>4)	Knee Immobilizers - Sizes: Small, Medium, Large, Universal. <BR>5)	Hinged Range of Motion Knee Brace (with ability to lock in desired position)- Sizes: Short, Medium, Regular, Long, XLong, Large, Universal. <BR>b.   Vendor must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes (some of the sizes above within each product line may be similar or not applicable due to the item being available as a universal (one size fits all) category) and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR>2.	Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Orthopedic Soft Goods - Knee product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) Your DAPA number is: __________________. <BR>3.	Vendor must have a separate agreement with the PV Owens & Minor for distribution in the Europe Region.  (Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  <BR>4.	Vendor must provide contact information (Name, phone number, and e-mail address) for a local vendor representative in the Europe Region in response to this RFQ.<BR>5.	Vendor must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>6.	Vendor must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>7.	Vendor must provide a statement confirming their products meet the industry production and safety standards (i.e., meets OSHA Standard Industrial Classification {SIC} description for 3842: Orthopedic, Prosthetic, and Surgical Appliances and Supplies) used in manufacturing Orthopedic Soft Goods - Knee products in response to this RFQ. <BR>8.	Vendor must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the Orthopedic Soft Goods - Knee products including dates, duration, cause, and resolution in response to this RFQ.  Vendors will not have the opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>9.	Vendor, in response to this RFQ, must provide statement revealing all products containing synthesized polymer (plastic/rubber) are clearly labeled as latex free/safe.<BR>10.	Vendor must provide documentation of what type of securement devices your company uses for your knee orthopedic soft goods in response to this RFQ.<BR>11.	Vendor must provide, in response to this RFQ, documentation of what type of lining your company uses for your knee orthopedic soft goods product items.<BR>12.	Vendor must provide, in response to this RFQ, documentation for products that require bending to be customized to a patient and if the use of bending irons or a heat gun is necessary.<BR>13.	Vendor must provide, in response to this RFQ, documentation explaining any products (i.e., knee brace) with the added features of being static (allowing no range of motion) or dynamic (adjustable hinge capable of locking the body part in flexion or extension).<BR>14.	Vendor must provide, in response to this RFQ, documentation that your products are designed to be worn over or under clothing.<BR>15.	Vendor must be able to ship samples necessary for evaluation via United States Parcel Service eliminating delays that occur with Europes Custom Offices.  Provide acknowledgement of this issue in response to this RFQ.  Samples required for this evaluation will be furnished by the vendors at no charge.  <BR><BR>	Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using hands on evaluation of samples in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  As mentioned in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 5:00PM EST on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Vendors must forward verification (e-mail) of shipment to the TRBO.<BR><BR>	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to more acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.   <BR> <BR>	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR>1. Patient Safety - The product is durable.<BR>a. A splint or brace for the lower extremity needs to be durable due to the forces incurred with weight bearing and patient mobility.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will visually inspect the product, confirming the quality of the material used to construct the item is acceptable.<BR>2. Patient Comfort - Product is lightweight.<BR>a. The weight of the splint or brace is important for patient comfort due to the length of time the device will need to be applied.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the weight of the item is acceptable.<BR>3. Proper Fit - The product has adjustable securement devices.<BR>		a. Allows proper fit to stabilize injured or diseased body part.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the adjustable closure device of the item is acceptable.<BR>4. Patient Comfort - Product has features to provide comfort to user.<BR>		a. The CPT will be looking for the different kinds of padding offered to 			allow for patient comfort.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will don the product, confirming the comfort of the item is acceptable.		<BR>5. Patient Safety - Product provides stability.<BR>a. This feature allows the stabilization of the body part protecting the body part from further injury.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 2 times by each participating MTF 			using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical 				setting.<BR>c. Evaluator will visually inspect and don the product, confirming the stability/function of the item is acceptable.		<BR><BR>	Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total  Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:<BR>1.	The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>2.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.<BR>3.	Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the government in this standardization initiative.<BR>

<DESC><p>Sources Sought Synopsis
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Global Monitoring Division (GMD), (hereinafter referred to as the Government) is currently conducting market research to determine the availability of potential vendors to provide highly accurate measurements of trace gas species on the island of Barbados. NOAA's very sensitive measurements are necessary to monitor the threat of depletion of stratospheric ozone. This is not a solicitation; it is only a Request for Information (RFI). The Government anticipates award of a contract with a 1-year base period followed by four 1- year option periods on or before April 1, 2009. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541990 and the small business size standard is $6.5 million dollars. The Government's draft Statement of Work is included as Attachment 1.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Since 1978, measurements of the trace gas species CFC-11 (CCl3F), CFC-12 (CCl2F2), carbon tetrachloride (CC14,) methyl chlorform (CH3CC13), and nitrous oxide N2O (later, the following were added, methane (CH4) and CFC-113 (CClF2-CCl2F), since 1985, and chloroform (CHC13) since 1995) have been made at East Point, Barbados by contractors, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA makes similar measurements at five additional sites and is, therefore, keenly interested in obtaining comparable data from Barbados. NOAA has partially supported the Barbados measurements since 1984. The project will likely continue another 20 years or so, or as long as there is a threat of depletion of stratospheric ozone amounts from the species being monitored.</p>
<p>The Barbados site is one of four stations comprising the current Advanced Global Atmopheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) network beginning in the time frame of 1993-1996. This network originated from the Atmospheric Lifetime Experiment (ALE) in 1978 and transformed to Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (GAGE) with the addition of new instruments during the 1981-1985 time frame. These networks were established to monitor the long-term trends of several trace gas species that cause stratospheric ozone destruction. Aside from the NOAA program, there are no other such national organized networks; only one or two other sites are operated by foreign governments. Data from the network are analyzed for long-term trends, changes in sources, and global budgets and published jointly by the AGAGE research team. The species are key compounds in the issues of stratospheric ozone depletion and "greenhouse" climate warming. Thus, a fundamental scientific need exists to monitor the atmospheric concentrations of these species and document their long-term increase. To establish the long-term change with high precision, the measurements must be made with a frequency of at least several observations per day. There is a critical scientific requirement that the future measurements are directly linked to those of the past and to the other sites of the GAGE network. This requirement is completely inflexible and, without this link to the past, the future measurements would have minimal value.</p>
<p>RFI Instructions:</p>
<p>The purpose of this request for information is to determine (1) whether there are sources capable of satisfying the Government's requirements and (2) to determine whether these services are provided to the commercial market. No proposals are being requested or accepted under this synopsis.</p>
<p>Interested sources must provide information regarding their capabilities to perform these measurements. Their qualification statement should indicate past performance, quality of instrumentation to perform the required measurements, and infrastructure to support long-term monitoring of species gases. In addition, responders should demonstrate that they understand the Barbados measurement location, infrastructure, data reporting, and data linkage. Responders should also provide a rough cost estimate for the first year of performance.</p>
<p>NOAA will consider all comments, supportive or critical, but may or may not use these individual comments. Qualification Statements will be treated separately from, and will have no bearing on, any subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting future formal Request for Proposals. NOAA will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments. NOAA, as noted above, is assessing the existence of sources and is requesting written comments from industry on the attached requirements. Written comments or e-mail messages shall be received no later than 2:00 P.M. Mountain Time, June 20, 2008. Sources interested in providing comments shall respond in writing to Susan Labovitz, MC3, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305. Submittals may also be sent by e-mail to Susan.Labovitz@noaa.gov. Telephone responses are not acceptable. This notice is not a Request for Proposals, Invitation for Bids, or Request for Quotes. It is a RFI and is part of the Government's market research process.</p>

<CONTACT>Demetria Chunn, 256-895-1189

<a href="mailto:demetria.chunn@hnd01.usace.army.mil">US Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville</a>
<DESC>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC), intends to award a modification to its Integrated Modular Medical Support Systems (IMMSS) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract which will increase the programmatic capacity.  The IMMSS Program requirements are currently executed via Firm-Fixed Price Task Orders which are placed against one sole-source ID/IQ Contract in order to provide quick response for IMMSS systems requirements and related services at Army Medical installations and facilities.  The contract was awarded in Fiscal Year 2005.  The existing capacity of the contract will be fully utilized before the end of Fiscal Year 2008.  As a result, CEHNC has developed its acquisition strategy and is in the process of conducting pre-award functions for the follow-on IMMSS acquisitions.  The awards are scheduled to be made during the 2nd quarter of Fiscal Year 2009.<BR><BR>The programmatic capacity for the current IMMSS contract was awarded at $50,000,000.00 for a possible five (5) year ordering period (one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods).  This capacity was established prior to the award of the contract based on an analysis of the type of work required, anticipated workload, effects on competition, the capability of small businesses to compete for the required work and upon historical IMMSS contracts and program data.  The IMMSS customers have critical medical facility requirements that must be performed.  The patient care at many of these facilities is inadequate for their service members due to the failing and failed facilities, systems and equipment.  Many of these facilities support wounded and disabled service members returning from the Global War on Terrorism.  Patient care requirements at these facilities have increased due to the effects of the Global War on Terrorism and BRAC realignments.  Due to these unanticipated conditions, the original capacity was inadequate to complete the increase in requirements.  As a result, it is necessary that the contracts be modified to allow for additional capacity to cover the ordering period.  Based upon future anticipated requirements, it is necessary that the Government modify the current contract to increase the programmatic ceiling by $21,200,000, which would result in a total programmatic ceiling of $71,200,000.  Upon award of the follow-on acquisitions, new task orders will not be placed against the current contract despite any remaining capacity.  <BR><BR>The current contract which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows:  W912DY-05-D-0005, Herman Miller, Inc.  The original basic contract Scope of Work for this contract award will remain unchanged.<BR><BR>The Government intends to award the modification to this contract consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy.  Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements would result, given any other action due to current circumstances.  Due to the unique prior experience and involvement of the current contractor and the anticipated recurring need for IMMSS systems, the actions proposed within this announcement are justified.  The Government will support the proposed actions by written justifications and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after the publication of this Notice of Intent will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this Notice of Intent is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received would normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Capability Statements submitted should demonstrate the offerors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  The statement shall include business size; ability to provide the required IMMSS product and or associated services; layers of subcontracting; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet the specific requirements.  Statements should not exceed five pages in length and provided in electronic format via email in a Microsoft Office or Adobe file format. <BR><BR>Written inquiries may be directed to Ms. Julie Shaddock via e-mail at julie.a.shaddock@usace.army.mil or Ms. Demetria Chunn via e-mail at demetria.chunn@usace.army.mil.   <BR><BR>Response submission shall be no later than June 16, 2008.  Late responses will not be considered. <BR>

CONFLICT OF INTERESET: 
FDA 1338 Individual Conflict of Interest

As a regulatory agency charged with protection of public health, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must maintain public confidence in the integrity of its decisions.  The FDA has policies and procedures that safeguard against actual and apparent conflict of interest on the part of its employees.  In contracting for review and evaluation of scientific data and information submitted to the agency, it is critical that the FDA be assured that there is no actual or apparent conflict of interest on the part of the individual contractor.  Offers performing work under this contract must assure the protection of information and data they receive under this contract from unauthorized use or disclosure, and must avoid actions that would cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality of the contractor.

DEFINITION of Conflict of Interest

Conflict of interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons or organizations, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, that the person's objectivity in performing the contract is or might be otherwise impaired, or that the person has or might acquire an unfair competitive advantage (see FAR 9.501).

CONTRACTORS CONFLICT OF INTEREST RESPONSIBILITIES
The individual contractor must be free of interest prior to performing under this contract.
Anytime prior to or during the performance of the contract the individual contractor believes that a potential or actual conflict exists, the individual should notify the project officer. The project officer will determine whether or not a conflict of interest exists and how to resolve or mitigate it. The contractor should not commence or continue working on the contract until directed by the project officer.


CONFLICT OF INTERSET SCREENING

An individual offeror /contractor submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation must submit the following information (if no relevant information exists, please provide a statement to that effect).

1. A list of any stock holdings and investments for you, your spouse and minor children.

2. Any positions, either compensated or not, that you currently hold (or have under negotiation).

3. Any contracts, grants, or cooperative research and development assignments that you are working on or have under negotiation;

4. Any other sources of income (not mentioned above)

5. Any other relevant information concerning any past, present, or planned interests that may have a bearing on the responsibilities described in the Statement of Work.

The project officer shall conduct a review if the information submitted and determine if a conflict of interest exists prior to forwarding any documents to the contractor.  Prior to submitting new work assignments, the project officer will follow-up with the contractor to determine if any changes to his/her financial interest have occurred.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST AGREEMENT

In executing this contract, the individual contractor agrees:

1. To report to the proper authority within the FDA (the Project Officer), any situation or event that may constitute a conflict of interest, whether actual or potential.

2. To act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any individual or organization which has submitted applications, information, and or data.

3.

EVALUATION:
The major evaluation factors for this solicitation include technical, which encompasses experience and past performance factors, and cost/price factors.  Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, cost/price is also important to the overall decision.  All evaluation factors, other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

Offerors are advised that award will be made to that offeror whose proposal provides the combination of features that offers the best or greatest overall value to the Government. The Government is more concerned with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than lowest overall cost.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance.  Overall cost to the Government may become the ultimate determining factor for award of a contract as proposals become more equal based on the other factors.

The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFQ. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully.  Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFQ.  Offeror must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed criteria listed below.

POTENTIAL AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS

The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.

TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA

The evaluation criteria are used by the technical evaluation committee when reviewing the technical proposals. SEE ATTACHMENT

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration is seeking sources to provide consulting services collaborate for a research program entitled, Gene expression profiling as a tool for development of predictive biomarkers for mesenchymal stem cells and their differentiation to multiple progenitor cells.  This is a REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Mesenchymal Stem cells (MSC) are isolated mainly from bone marrow and adipose tissue but can be found in other tissues such as synovium, periosteum or placenta. They differentiate into three lineages; chondrocytes, osteoblasts and adipocytes.  These cells have been shown to inhibit immune responses meaning that MSCs from allogeneic donors can be used in recipients of many different HLA haplotypes. MSC may modulate the function of the major immune cell populations, including antigen-presenting cells, T cells, B cells and natural killer cells.   This project will use gene expression profiling of these two cell populations to identify some marker genes which could be responsible for adipocyte differentiation and also for maintaining proliferation capacity in small cell population. Similar studies will be also carried out on other lineages of mesenchymal calls such as bone, cartilage, muscles etc.  1) technical knowledge and experience in micro-array analysis of gene expression for human embryonic stem cells,  2) technical knowledge and practical experience in validating micro-array data by established and qualified assays, 3) demonstrated ability to perform bio-informatic analysis of micro-array results and data validation as evidenced by publications in peer-reviewed journals and scientific meeting presentations, 4) demonstrated ability to maintain mouse and human embryonic stem cells in tissue culture.  A monthly Deliverable with Biologic Research results will be required (6 total), The period of performance is 06/15/2008- 12/15/2008.  Proposals will be evaluated 80% on technical qualifications, 20% on price.  

REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services, which will be considered if received by the fifteenth (15th) calendar day following the appearance of this announcement.  A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Award will be made to the vendor(s) whose conforming quotation represents the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation.  The Government expects best value to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price in response to the RFQ.  Technical acceptability will be determined by the vendor's ability to meet the technical requirements of the Statement of Work/Specifications and to provide for on time delivery.  All qualified responsible and CCR registered business sources may submit a quotation for consideration by NARA.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:  Polyester film sleeves, sealed on one long side and one short side, according to the specifications listed below; film thickness: 4 mil; dimensions and sealed sides: to be specified in procurement document.  SPECIFICATIONS: 1. Composition:  Must be a clear, colorless, biaxially oriented/stressed/drawn polyethylene terephthalate film such as DuPont Teijin Melinex 516 or equivalent; and must not contain any plasticizers, surface coatings, or UV inhibitors.  The material must be guaranteed to be non-yellowing at ambient temperatures with natural aging, and dimensionally stable.  NARA reserves the right to test the material to ensure that these criteria are met.  2.  Seals:  Each sleeve is to be sealed on one long side and one short side using edge welding [heat].  NO ADHESIVES MAY BE USED.  All seals must be complete, clear, and continuous; and each item must be free of planar distortion [i.e. must rest flat on a flat surface].  Sealed edges must withstand moderate handling, as evaluated by the following three methods: By pulling the seal between two fingernails at a 45 angle; By running a finger along the inside of the seal; and By pulling slightly at the beginning of the cut end of a sealed edge.  If the seal cracks or splits during any of these manipulations, it is unacceptable.  3.  Thickness/Dimensions:  Unless otherwise specified in the procurement document, the polyester film thickness must be 4mil.  Dimensions [height and width] will be specified in the procurement document; the tolerance must not exceed +/- 0.0625 inch.  4.

In order to be considered for an award, prices must be submitted for each item.  Also, vendors must quote prices for the initial 12 month period as well as the option periods in order to be considered for an award.  Failure to fully comply with the stated requirement may be cause for rejection of the quotation.  The Government will evaluate alternate pricing based on a 5% or 50% guaranteed minimum quantity to the vendor(s).  Therefore, vendors must complete both TABLE A and TABLE B to be considered for award.  The Government guarantees that 5% or 50% (at the Governments option at time of award) of the Contract Maximum Quantities will be ordered during the base period and during each year the option is exercised.  For evaluation of pricing, only pricing from the same scheme will be compared.  The Government will choose only one of these schemes and any award(s) will be made from the same pricing scheme.  The vendor must provide film sleeves in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW)/Specifications.  Individual orders placed against this contract will indicate the respective item quantities and the shipping address for delivery.  The unit prices are fixed price.

Delivery must be undertaken during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, unless mutually agreed upon by NARA and the vendor.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for services in which the government intends to acquire in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) located in Monterey, CA require the services of a contractor to provide technical analyses and program coordination for the staff of the MBNMS on the topic of coastal erosion and armoring, as well as facilitation of the Southern Monterey Bay Coastal Erosion Workgroup (SMBCEW), and coordination of several studies and pilot projects. The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) provides resource protection through management, research, and education programs that foster public understanding and stewardship of this nationally significant marine ecosystem.  The Sanctuary coordinates and participates in resource protection initiatives on a broad array of issues, including ecosystem protection, water quality, coastal development, and wildlife disturbance. To assist in these efforts, the Sanctuary requires technical and policy services for evaluating and addressing coastal development issues focused on addressing coastal erosion and maintaining beach width. These activities will continue and build upon initiatives outlined in the Sanctuary's existing management plan and in the Sanctuary's Joint Management Plan Review (JMPR).  The MBNMS has other resource protection staff and contractors, so the contractor will be expected to interact with that existing team.  The level of expertise needed equates to a GS-11 if federally employed. Contractor will address the following issues related to coastal development: Coastal Erosion-- <br />a. Coordinate and oversee a regional pilot project to maintain and restore beach habitat in the Southern Monterey Bay littoral cell using Pressure Equalizing Modules (PEMs). PEM is a passive beach dewatering system that causes the beach to retain more sediments on the foreshore area (between the low water line and the high water line), forming a more erosion-resistant beach.  This regional project would draw on the existing efforts of the SMBCEW, and would fund the installation of PEMs along an 8,600-foot shoreline between 1,300 northeast of Tioga Avenue, Sand City, and 300 feet southwest of Ocean Harbor House condominiums.<br />and 300 feet southwest of Ocean Harbor House condominiums. Coordination and oversight will include: working with local jurisdictions and researchers to identify funding and experimental design to document the effects of the PEMs on coastal erosion; working with experts to assess potential issues (including environmental and socioeconomic impacts, effects on sand transport, etc.) associated with the placement of PEMs; reporting on the success of the pilot project; assessing regulatory considerations and acquiring permits; facilitating review by the SMBCEW of the PEM pilot study, and; reviewing progress and ensuring quality of work done by consultant(s).<br />b) Coordinate and oversee a Technical Evaluation of Alternative Approaches to Addressing Coastal Erosion in the Southern Monterey Bay Region and Littoral Cell to be conducted by a team of consultants funded by MBNMS. Responsibilities will include: assembling a selection committee to review proposals, interview applicants and select qualified consultant(s); providing overviews and background materials to consultants; conducting regular meetings with consultants and in certain cases with an advisory committee consisting of MBNMS, Association of Monterey bay Area Governments (AMBAG) and State of CA partners, to provide feedback on the project; conducting associated research about regulatory considerations of the various alternatives and providing to consultant; ensuring consistency with the Coastal Regional Sediment Management Plan for the southern Monterey Bay littoral cell; facilitating review by the Southern Monterey Bay Coastal Erosion Workgroup of draft documents produced by consultant(s); reviewing progress and quality of work done by consultant(s), and; conducting outreach on results of the technical evaluation. <br />c.) Coordinate with MBNMS staff and other stakeholders (including state, local and federal regulatory agencies and jurisdictions, conservation interests, scientific experts, etc.) on implementation of the MBNMS Coastal Armoring Action Plan, with a focus on the pilot study area of the beaches in the Southern Monterey Bay region.<br />d.)Coordinate and facilitate meetings of existing MBNMS Southern Monterey Bay Coastal Erosion workgroup including: development of meeting agendas; preparation and delivery of presentations; preparation of workgroup handouts; documentation of group decisions; facilitation of meetings and consensus-based decision making processes; inviting and coordinating guest speakers and participants, etc. <br />e.) Identify additional studies and evaluations needed for more detailed analyses of priority alternatives.  Coordinate with workgroup members and other experts to pursue additional evaluations needed and identify appropriate regulatory processes.  Assist in identifying staffing and funding alternatives to pursue additional studies and implementation projects.<br />f.) Conduct southern Monterey Bay coastal erosion-related investigations and research and prepare reports and presentations to SMBCEW and other audiences. Research methods include interviewing experts and other stakeholders, review of literature and other information, and site visits. Examples may include acquiring information on the existing sand mining operation in Marina, further investigation of emerging or proven coastal erosion response alternatives, or investigation of partnerships or projects/funding opportunities for coastal erosion response projects in southern Monterey Bay region.<br />g.) Continue ongoing analysis of coastal erosion patterns, land use, and existing developments susceptible to risk, drawing on existing documents and expertise of MBNMS coastal erosion workgroup group.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice in conjunction with procedures in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued. This is also notice that The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), intends to negotiate under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), a sole source contract with Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Inc. for the acquisition of the following requirement:
<p>A dual armed liquid handling system which is expandable. One arm must be a 96 tip head which can load 384 well plates; the other must be able to "cherry pick" individual samples from a 96 well plate. Platform must hold multiple plates.</p>
<p>The following specifications represent minimum acceptable criteria:</p>
<p>The system must be capable of using eight fixed washable or disposable tips at one time. It should also be capable of using any number of lesser tips independently. All tips will be located on a single arm for high throughput sample processing. Each sampling tip will be capable of independent motion in the Z-direction.</p>
<p>All systems must be configurable enabling a choice of methods for eliminating carry-over between samples. Must be able to use both disposable tips and fixed washable tips to be used on a single sample probe. No manual intervention is required to switch from one tip type to another. Changing from disposable tips to fixed washable tip processing can be done within a single operation step in a protocol.</p>
<p>The Instrument must be equipped with 8-tip pipetting arm.</p>
<p>The system must allow the user to utilize a variety of dispense heads to be automatically switched "on-the-fly" for optimal performance. Choices of dispense heads shall not be limited to: P235 and P50 96-channel dispense heads, P30 384-channel dispense head, and the P1 384-channel head capable of pipetting between 50 and 1000 nL.</p>
<p>Instruments shall also be able to utilize a variety of pin tool options that can be automatically switched "on-the-fly."</p>
<p>The Instrument should be able to aspirate greater than 1.5ml of solvent in a single aspiration step.</p>
<p>System must offer optional low volume sampling tip options to enable pipetting volumes below 10 &mu;L and down to 500 nL. Submicroliter pipetting must be available with both disposable tips and fixed washable tips.</p>
<p>The liquid handling system must be capable of providing independent liquid level sensing in a multi-tipped mode with fixed, washable sampling tips or disposable tips. The minimum volume to be detected should be 50 &mu;L in a microplate and 100 &mu;L in a test tube.</p>
<p>Liquid level sensing must be capable of detecting non-ionic and organic solvents such as deionized water, DMSO or methanol.</p>
<p>When utilizing fixed tips or conductive disposable tips, the system's liquid level sensing must be sensitive enough to detect sample volumes of less than 100 &mu;L in test tubes or 50 &mu;L in microplates with standard racks and in a multi-tipped configuration.</p>
<p>The liquid handling system must be equipped with variable tips for automatic computer-controlled variable sample probe spacing. This enables most formats of labware such as tubes, microplates, PCR plates, vials or reagent troughs to be processed in a multi-tipped mode.</p>
<p>Systems must be capable of probe-to-probe spacing from 9 to 20 mm with four-tip systems or 9 to 40 mm with eight-tip systems.</p>
<p>When equipped with variable tips, should be able to utilize both standard and conductive disposable tips. Conductive tips should enable liquid level sensing.</p>
<p>Multiple disposable tip sizes should be compatible on single sampling probe including 10 &mu;L, 20&mu;L, 200&mu;L, and 1000&mu;L tips. All disposable tips should be capable of being utilized in a multi-tip mode.</p>
<p>The system must include electrical sensors to verify disposable tip pick up and disposal. Sensors should be capable of being turned on or off at a users discretion.</p>
<p>Software should enable users to determine when to dispose of tips and when to reuse them. System should be capable of re-using a tip when performing duplicate transfers.</p>
<p>Disposable tips should be available in both robotic compatible tip boxes and hanging tip boxes.</p>
<p>The system must include the ability to operate at the user discretion with fewer than total tips configured on the system at one time.</p>
<p>The system should have a capacity of up to 32 microplates tiles.</p>
<p>The system must allow any combination of labware to be included on deck for use in processing within a single protocol. Labware should include but not be limited to test tubes, microplates, deep well plates, troughs, micro centrifuge vials, etc.</p>
<p>System should be compatible with a variety of automated temperature control options enabling both chilling and heating to occur on the deck. Multiple heating tiles can be operated automatically, simultaneously, and independently at different temperatures ranging from ambient to 100C.</p>
<p>The system software shall be built around a graphical user interface with mouse-driven pull-down menus and shall be compatible with Windows XP operating system. The software must allow 'drag and drop' functionality for definition of labware on the deck.</p>
<p>Software programs must be provided as standard to test accuracy and precision performance of each syringe pump, XYZ motions and liquid level sensing to satisfy GLP (Good Laboratory Practice). Hard copies of precision/accuracy performance should be generated when a printer is provided.</p>
<p>The system must be capable of demonstrating precision of better than 3.0% coefficient of variation at 5 &mu;L with a 20 &mu;L tip. Also precision of less than 1.0% should be seen at 50 &mu;L with a 200 &mu;L tip dispensing distilled water. In both cases accuracy of better than +/- 1.0% should be seen.</p>
<p>Software should enable users to define customized message boxes before or after protocols, or between tests allowing for easier user instructions and interfacing with other instrumentation.</p>
<p>Templates should be convertable to Read-only format to prevent user from modifying validated protocols.</p>

This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared under the authority of FAR 13.5 and Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included herein, and is a 100 percent Set-Aside for Small Business concerns. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

In accordance with FAR 19.5, this acquisition is identified under NAICS code 333415  Air Conditioning and Warm Air Heating Equipment and Commercial and Industrial Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturing.  The small business size standard under this NAICS code is 750 employees (or less).

The Naval Air Warfare Center  - Aircraft Division  (NAWCAD) has a requirement for a Conditioned Air System (CAS) to be used at the Propulsion System Evaluation Facility (PSEF).  The conditioned air system will be used for the Altitude Environmental Chamber (AEC) in the Propulsion Systems Evaluation Facility (PSEF) at the NAWCAD Patuxent River, MD for RDT&E testing of small air-breathing propulsion systems.  The Navy is seeking either a commercial off the shelf CAS or non-developmental items that can be modified by the contractor and integrated into a single system to meet the Navys requirement and install the system at PSEF, Patuxent River, MD.  Detailed requirements below. 
 
NOTE TO OFFERS:
The Government intends to award either CLIN 0001 or CLIN 0002 but not both.  

The Conditioned Air System must meet the following minimum requirements:

1.  CLIN 0001  Conditioned Air System (CAS) - Quantity  1 EA
The CAS shall operate outside in ambient conditions of 10F to 100F and 5% to 100% relative humidity.  The CAS equipment, components, and hardware shall be fabricated using corrosion resistant material.  The airflow path materials shall not shed any material that could flow downstream to the engine under test in the AEC.  The CAS shall be capable of delivering conditioned air to the AEC with the following specifications.  

Conditioned Air Requirements
	Heating/Cooling Design Point Air Flow (scfm)1	800
	Discharge Air Low Temperature (F)2		-65
	Discharge Air High Temperature (F)		160

Note 1 -  scfm =  standard cubic feet per minute

Note 2 - Facility air with a -40 Dew Point Temperature (F) will be supplied to the CAS.  The quantity of residual moisture in the air is very small and further reduction in the airs Dew Point Temperature is not required for the application intended. 

The CAS shall take-in facility supplied, oil free, compressed air (see Government Pad Site Facilities, below), expand the air, as necessary, to obtain set point flow rate, raise or lower the air temperature to meet the set point temperature, filter the air to remove particles down to 10 microns, and then discharge the conditioned air into the AECs 10 inch diameter insulated supply pipe.  The filter media shall be accessible and replaceable during routine maintenance.  The pressure in the AEC supply pipe can vary from 5.5 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) to 18 psia dependent upon the engine test conditions.  

The CAS shall include an overpressure protection device with automatic resetting  capability to prevent overpressure of the CAS when the discharge airflow path is completely blocked due to flow path conditions downstream.  The CAS shall have the capability to regulate the facility airflow rate into the CAS. The CASs airflow path shall be sized to handle up to 3000 scfm air (maximum available facility airflow rate).  The CAS cooling and heating requirements apply only at the Heating/Cooling Design Point Air Flow condition.  The CAS shall have the capability of controlling the discharge temperature to  2 oF of the set point.  The CAS shall have the capability of changing the discharge temperature from extreme set points ((maximum high to maximum low) or (maximum low to maximum high)) in less than 75 minutes.  

The system shall have two control panels, one mounted on the CAS and the other located remotely in the AEC control rooms, industry standard 19 wide x 25 deep, instrumentation rack.  The CAS shall have the capability for the operator to regulate airflow rate, change the temperature discharge air set point, and start and stop the CAS from either control panel.  It is estimated that 250 ft. of cable shall be required to tie in the CAS to the test cell control room instrumentation rack.  The control panels shall have separate digital displays for continuous display of each of the following parameters:  CAS inlet and outlet pressures (units - psia), inlet and outlet temperatures (units - F), inlet and outlet dew points (units-F), and air mass flowrate (units  scfm) through the CAS up to 3000 scfm. The CAS shall have an hour meter to log total CAS run time.  

The control panels shall have the capability for viewing CAS diagnostic, machine health and fault condition parameters.  The CAS shall have doors and internal passageways for ease of accessibility of personnel performing maintenance on equipment.  If the CAS uses facility cooling water, the CAS shall have the capability to be gravity drained of all its cooling water for maintenance actions and freeze protection.  The CAS shall be designed for a minimum of 120 hours of continuous operation between routine maintenance actions.

2.  CLIN 0002  Conditioned Air System (CAS) - Quantity 1 EA

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 02 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR VACUUMSYSTEMS PARTS AND FITTINGS.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote.This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a writtenamendment will not be issued.The purpose of this amendment is to respond to the question as follows:(Q) Lines 1 through 16 call for "Blank KF".  This does not appear to be an accuratedescription because it is contrary to standard nomenclature. Here's why:"Blank" is used to indicate no bore/through-hole in the flange or stub.It is common for lines 1 through 8 to be "Blank KF", but not lines 9 through 16.  So,this brings us to question which, if any, are actually "Blank" or non-bored?  I believeit is safe to assume that the conical reducers have bored holes, since it would beimpractical for them to be "Blank" on either end or both ends.(A) If the description says "blank" then there will not be any holes or ports in them. Asfar as the conical reducers they are thru ports with holes already in them depending onthe sizes asked for in the description, 25 to 16 and so forth. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on May 21, 2008.

The Advanced Technical Exploitation Programs (ATEP) Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) is comprised of the following four separate attachments: (1) Draft Performance Work Statement, (2) Draft Section H, (3) Draft Section L, and (4) Draft Section M.  Comments are due NLT 1500 local, 9 May 2008, and are to be sent to Ms. Joey Pence, ASC/PKESI, 2275 D St, Bldg 16, Rm 132, WPAFB, OH 45433-7228; e-mail:  joey.pence@wpafb.af.mil.




4 March 2008
Urgent Information concerning the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program (ATEP)follows:   Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) is not recognizing ATEP'ssolicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2560. Consequently, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS post toATEP did not post on FBO under said solicitation number. After numerous attemptsby PIXS and FBO administrators to resolve the issue, both concluded the onlysolution is to reissue ATEP information under a new solicitation number.Therefore to ensure you receive any and all updates to the ATEP, you must register/re-register under the new solicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2599. The name of theprogram has not changed, it is still the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program(ATEP).

Additionally, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS posting issuing a new sources sought synopsis isalso attached.   That posting issued a suspense date of 1500 local, 14 Mar 08 forsubmittal of capability statements.  Due to the posting difficulties, a new suspense date of 1500 local, 18 Mar 08 is established. There are no other changes to the requirements for submittals.


   For more information on "ADVANCED TECHNICAL EXPLOITATION PROGRAM (ATEP)", please refer to: https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=5549

<DESC>Amendment 0002 to the solicitation will be posted on or about June 3, 2008 due to computer system upgrades. The solicitation close date has changed from June 3, 2008 at 2:00 p.m. to June 9, 2008 at 2:00 p.m. This notice also provides answers to questions which have been submitted. The information provided within this notice will be available on or about May 29, 2008 at www.yuma.army.mil/contracting under solicitation number W9124R-08-R-0002.<BR><BR>Q1) Proposal Format Clarification: Do we need 3 binders  1 for each part number with the original and extra copies in it or 8 binders  one binder for each part plus a binder for each additional copy? It would also be helpful to find out if the tabs are intended to divide a, b, and c under each part plus tabs for the 5 or 6 parts under a, b or c.<BR><BR>A1) On page 61 of 71 of the solicitation under Proposal Submission Instructions, Proposal Format, paragraph 1 states that the overall proposal shall consist of three (3) physically separate and detachable parts, individually entitled for each part. Paragraph 2 of this section explains the number of copies to be submitted in additional to the original for each part. Paragraph 3 of the same section states that the separate sections of each binder shall be tabbed for ease of identification. For ease of reference, consecutive page numbering with tabs is required. <BR><BR>Q2) Schedule of Price Clarification: The description and SOW paragraphs referenced in the Exhibit Line Item Numbers do not correspond to the description and paragraphs used in the SOW.  Will this be corrected or should we bid IAW the matching SOW descriptions and ignore the paragraph numbers?<BR><BR>A2) Due to a computer glitch Attachment 01  Specification will be replaced with a corrected Attachment 01  Specification which will have corresponding description paragraphs for the Exhibit Line Item Numbers (ELINs) contained within the solicitation.<BR><BR>Q3) Wage Clarification: Only the General Decision for Residential was included as part of the bid package.  Does the Wage Decision for Building need to be added?<BR><BR>A3) The General Decision for Residential was included as part of the solicitation for roof work that will fall under that category.  The General Decision for Building was not provided as one is not available. <BR><BR>The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) issues wage determinations under the Davis-Bacon Act (DBA) using available statistical data on prevailing wages and benefits paid in a specific locality. On occasion, the data does not contain sufficient information to issue rates for a particular classification of worker needed in the performance of the contract. Because of this, DBA provisions contain a conformance procedure for the purpose of establishing an enforceable wage and benefit rate for the missing classification.<BR><BR>Contractors are responsible for determining the appropriate staffing necessary to perform the contract work. Contractors are also responsible for complying with the minimum wage and benefits requirements for each classification performing work on the contract. If a classification considered necessary by the contractor for performance of the work is not listed on the applicable wage determination, the contractor must initiate a request for approval of an additional classification along with the proposed wage and benefit rates for that classification.<BR><BR>The awarded Contractor initiates the request by preparing an SF-1444, Request for Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, at the time of employment of the unlisted classification. (Reference FAR 22.406-3 and 52.222-6(b), and Title 29 CFR Part 5, Section 5.5(a)). The contractor completes blocks 2 through 15 on the form. Request may be submitted to DOL without the form, but must contain the required information.<BR><BR>Employees, if present, or their designated representative must sign block 16 noting their concurrence or disagreement with the contractor's proposed wage and benefit rate. If the employee indicates disagreement with the contractor's proposal, he must provide a statement supporting a recommendation for different rates. (Designated representative is generally a union. It cannot be the contractor 's personnel officer or other contractor representative.)<BR><BR>The Contractor submits the request to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer reviews the request for completeness and signs the form designating the contracting agency's concurrence or disagreement with regard to the contractor's proposal. If the Contracting Officer indicates disagreement with the contractor's proposal, a statement must be attached supporting a recommendation for different rates. The Contracting Officer then submits the proposal with all attachments to DOL for approval. The Contractor is obligated to pay the proposed wage and benefit rates pending a response from DOL. <BR><BR>Q4) I am interested in submitting a proposal for the roofing IDIQ project at the Yuma Proving Ground.  I noticed that the Davis Bacon Wage Rates included in the solicitation are for residential projects.  I dont think that these rates will apply to the IDIQ when we are working on commercial buildings.  I looked up the wage rates on the Davis Bacon website for commercial projects and there is not a roofing wage rate included.  What wage rate will be required when working on commercial buildings completed during this project?<BR><BR>A4) Refer to the answer provided in A3.<BR><BR>Q5) On the Gray and White sheets page 20 of 71 line D0010U there is no Quantity or unit listed.  This is repeated on the subsequent E0010U line item as well. Please advise? <BR><BR>A5) For Exhibit Line Item Numbers (ELINs) A0010U, B0010U, C0010U, D0010U and E0010U the quantity is 200 and the unit of measurement is Lineal Foot (LF). Corrected ELINs will be provided when Amendment 0002 is posted.<BR><BR>Q6) on page 61 of 71 part 2 the second sentence calls out that Parts I and II shall be submitted as an original plus (2) sets of hard copies. Part II is the Past Performance Proposal which is submitted directly to you and thus not in our bid package.  Please clarify? <BR><BR>A6) The Past Performance Survey, Attachment 5, is to be submitted directly to us by the evaluating agency. Part II-Past Performance Proposal is to be submitted to the Government for evaluation and shall consist of items found within either paragraph a, b or c. Part II-Past Performance Proposal shall be submitted in accordance with the Proposal Submission Instructions found on page 61 of 71 of the solicitation.  Part II-Past Performance Proposal will not contain the Past Performance Survey, Attachment 5, as that will be submitted to the Government by the evaluating agency.<BR>

<DESC><p>This notification modification provides answers to questions received in response to the Request for Information (RFI), following the guidance therein. The date for receipt of responses to this RFI remains unchanged at 9:00am EST, June 2, 2008.
<p>NITAAC would like to take this opportunity to express its appreciation for the interest shown in this requirement and the responses provided.</p>
<p>1. Question:<br />When does the government anticipate acquisition planning to take place regarding CIO-SPNEW?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The acquisition planning is already taking place through the use of this RFI. After evaluating responses to the RFI, the government will develop a business case to the Office of Management and Budget. Upon approval, the government intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) at that time.</p>
<p>2. Question:<br />When does the government anticipate issuing an RFP? The RFI indicates a potential RFP release date of June 2008 for CIO-SP3. Can the government confirm this approximate date?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The government intends to issue an RFP as soon as possible, pending government approvals; however, the government will invest the time necessary to create an RFP that meets the needs of the customers, anticipate new technology over the next ten years, provide a quick and easy to use contracting vehicle for customers, provide fair opportunity to industry, and promote maximum participation of small and small disadvantaged business.</p>
<p>3. Question:<br />Has any press release been made to advertise the RFI to the public?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />No.</p>
<p>4. Question:<br />Can the GWAC be written as a hybrid contract to go beyond only IT?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />No.</p>
<p>5. Question:<br />What are the Clinger-Cohen restrictions on the contract?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The contract scope must be information technology and designed to serve the needs of federal agencies.</p>
<p>6. Question:<br />Has a final decision been made about combining CIO-SP2i and IW2nd?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />No. The government is looking to industry for pros and cons regarding the combination of these two GWACs. Please refer to question 5.1.1:</p>
<p>5.1.1 Currently, NIH is obtaining these services under two separate GWACs, the CIO-SP2i and IW2nd. Considering how imaging is being integrated throughout other IT systems, NIH is planning on combining these two contracts into one. Please describe any advantages or disadvantages and whether imaging should be a separate functional area in the contract or integrated with the other functional areas.</p>
<p>7. Question:<br />What influence, if any, will the RFI responses have on the RFP release and the ultimate award of CIO-SPNEW? For example, will RFI responses be scored in any manner?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />Responses to RFIs have no bearing on the evaluation of any individual future proposal responses to the planned RFI. Responses will not be scored, but will provide input into the RFP planning process.</p>
<p>8. Question:<br />Will RFI responses be utilized or considered as part of a down-select process?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />No.</p>
<p>9. Question:<br />Is there an industry day coming?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />There is no industry day planned in relation to the RFI.</p>
<p>10. Question:<br />Can the government please provide specifics for what the RFP process will involve?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The government will follow the normal process provided for in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. As stated in the RFI, the government will use the response from the RFI in helping develop the Statement of Work and acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>11. Question:<br />The existing CIO-SP2i contract is a Task Order service contract and the existing IW2nd contract includes Task Orders and Solutions and Services as well as Delivery Orders for products. If it is the government's intention to combine these two contracts into one, does the government envision that the contract will have both Task Orders and Delivery Orders?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The government is considering various options as to the structure if these two contracts are combined and welcomes any suggestions.</p>
<p>12. Question:<br />If the new contract will have both Task Orders and Delivery Orders, will the products be segregated as a separate CLIN or Task Area?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />The government is considering various options and welcomes any suggestions.</p>
<p>13. Question:<br />Would primes all be required to bid products on the contract?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />This decision will be made after consideration of all options.</p>
<p>14. Question:<br />Can the government describe the process for issuing orders under the new contracts?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />This is still to be determined. Any suggested refinements to the procedures currently used for the CIO-SP2i and the IW2nd GWACS would be welcome at this point.</p>
<p>15. Question:<br />Would the government identify advantages in using the GWAC over GSA ordering, open market commercial contracts, or other mechanisms available for ordering these services?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />a. Empowers government health providers and CIOs by offering a choice from a large number of pre-qualified vendors<br />b. Reduces costs by streamlining and automating the acquisition of health IT<br />c. Range of contract types and order terms to best suit customer unique needs<br />d. Broad IT scope, but with a focus on supporting research and health missions within the federal government.<br />e. Effective management controls.</p>
<p>16. Question:<br />Would the award strategy allow for a stable of contractors where government customers have the option to limit proposals to small businesses, service disabled veteran owned small business, etc.?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />NITAAC is exploring options to promote small and small disadvantaged businesses including the potential for systematic task order set asides for small and disadvantaged businesses. The RFI is also seeking ideas from industry and from the government as to the best ways of maximizing small and small disadvantaged business participation.</p>
<p>17. Question:<br />What will the invoice payment process be for NIH buyers?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />This is still to be determined but will be consistent with the new NIH business system guidelines.</p>
<p>18. Question:<br />What steps are in place to ensure timely payments?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />This is still to be determined but will be consistent with the new NIH business system guidelines.</p>
<p>19. Question:<br />Is a potential vendor excluded from receiving the RFP if they don't submit an RFI?</p>
<p>Answer: No. Response to the RFI is strictly optional and voluntary.</p>
<p>20. Question:<br />Is a potential vendor excluded from receiving the answers to the questions if they don't submit a response to the RFI?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />No.</p>
<p>21. Question:<br />Are there any page limitations?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />There is no page limitation to responses to the RFI.</p>
<p>22. Question:<br />Will contractor questions be released so that all interested offerors can review them?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />Questions received in response to the RFI and follow the guidelines therein are being released.</p>
<p>23. Question:<br />In Section 5 - Directed Topics for Reponses, the RFI states, "The government requests vendors respond to the RFI in the order specified in the sections below." None of these sections cover Section 2 - Scope. Because a contractor intends to demonstrate its qualifications in one or more of the "Scope" areas in Section 2, should the contractor include its "Scope" responses after the Section 5 responses, or should the contractor include its "Scope' responses according to the instructions in Section 4 that state, "A statement of qualifications for the firm including a brief description of the firm's quality control processes for deliverables"?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The RFI does not require an extensive demonstration of the contractor's qualifications for the scope areas described. It is only asking for a general description of corporate capabilities, which should be addressed as a response to topic number 3, statement of qualifications.</p>
<p>24. Question:<br />Is the government requesting information in regards to available technology under each Task Area or is it simply requesting contractors to provide responses to Sections 5.1 - 5.6.4.?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The focus of this RFI is to solicit feedback from customers and contractors on the questions is Sections 5.1 - 5.6.4. A general description of a firm's available technology can be included as a response to topic 3, statement of qualifications. This information would be helpful to the evaluation of a response to this RFI, but is not required.</p>
<p>25. Question:<br />Can the government provide clarification on the term "partial qualification"? Paragraph 5.1.9., the government states, "in the interest of attracting capable contractors who specialize in areas of interest to NIH, contractors may be qualified on a subset of the 10 task areas. What does the government envision as the advantages and disadvantages of partial qualification?" Is the government requesting commentary on structuring the vehicle such that vendors bid and subsequently be awarded specific task areas, or that vendors bid and subsequently awarded access to the vehicle based on qualification against a subset of the task areas - however - the vendors are still able to bid tasks across all functional areas, or is the government requesting commentary on both scenarios?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />The government's intention is to qualify contractors by task area. There will be contractors that qualify in all task areas, and there may be contractors that qualify in only one or several of the task areas. Depending on the specific needs of the customer, qualified contractors would choose whether to pursue the individual task orders.</p>
<p>26. Question:<br />Regarding Section 5.5., Security 5.5.2. Please clarify the question, "What risks exist and what mitigation steps can be taken?" What risks exist where and for what, e.g., organization/infrastructure/technology)?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />For health IT, there could be specific risks involved in protecting privacy information, etc. The government is interested in feedback regarding new risks being encountered in this field and the steps taken to mitigate these risks.</p>
<p>27. Question:<br />In sections 5.2. and 5.4., the RFI refers to the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA). Will the CIO-SP solicitation specify use of the Federal Healthcare Architecture (FHA)?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The government is interested in encouraging use of FHA. To what extent FHA is covered in the contract vice an individual task order is an item to be determined.</p>
<p>28. Question:<br />The Department of Health and Human Services has mandated the Troux Metis EA tool for department-wide use. Will the NIH, through the CIO-SP vehicle, be open to use of other EA products and tools?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />EA products and tool requirements would be provided within the scope of specific individual task orders, and not mandated as part of the GWAC contract scope. Other agencies may use this contract for enterprise architecture efforts that involve the use of EA tools other than Metis.</p>
<p>29. Question:<br />If a company's algorithm is proprietary and as such cannot be FIPS 140-2 validated through NIST for non-classified use, would this situation preclude the company's involvement in this project?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />No. However, an agency can require FIPS 140-2 validation in an individual task order. In such a case, the vendor will either have to seek validation or risk having its proposal disqualified during the task order source selection process.</p>
<p>30. Question:<br />Because the security questions in Sections 5.5.1. through 5.5.5. are fairly broad and responses can vary quite widely depending upon specific technologies, will the government please elaborate and provide guidance on the specifics and perspective of the information it is hoping to receive in response to these questions?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The government is looking at this only in broad terms in order to include the necessary requirements in the RFP.</p>
<p>31. Question:<br />There are several questions regarding Section 5.5. Security that are focused on how information is secured and authenticated on a company's database and during transmission (questions 5.5.2. - 5.5.5.). Is the intent of these questions to understand how the contractors' corporate security policies align with HHS/NIH or is HHS/NIH looking for technical alternatives to their own security policies and practices?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The intent of this question is to understand how the contractors' corporate security policies align with HHS/NIH. NITAAC does not intend to consider alternatives to HHS/NIH policies and procedures except possibly when alternatives are specified by a non-HHS/NIH customer. However, the government will consider including in the RFP the ability for HHS/NIH to consider alternatives and under what circumstances.</p>
<p>32. Question:<br />Does NIH anticipate that the contractor will control or take possession of PHI on behalf of the client?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />We are not clear what is being asked.</p>
<p>33. Question:<br />Does NIH anticipate that the contractor would become a "business associate" as defined by HIPAA regulations?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />If so, the requirement would be included in an individual task order.</p>
<p>34. Question:<br />The difference between Task Area #2 and #3 is not clear. Will the government please provide further guidance on what they expect in each of these areas?</p>
<p>Answer: Task Area #2, Outsourcing, supports the management and operations of government business functions, assuming that they are essentially IT functions. For instance, the outsourcing of an IT support call center would be within scope of Task Area #2. Task Area #3, IT Operations and Maintenance, focuses specifically on the maintenance and operations of computer systems. Work under Task Area #3 is not oriented towards the outsourcing of government function that the computer systems provide, but a more limited outsourcing of the labor required to operate and maintain a system that may be housed within a government facility.</p>
<p>35. Question:<br />Under Task 2, would the government provide further clarification as to what is meant by IT Business Functions?</p>
<p>Answer: IT business functions include any aspect of a government function, as defined in the Federal Enterprise Architecture Business Reference Model which is performed through the use of information technology.</p>
<p>36. Question:<br />Would the government please provide specific information regarding question 5.5.4., e.g., does this question refer to data and access from laptops, or is the data in an application, or in another location, e.g., an eRoom?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />The government is unclear as to this question.</p>
<p>37. Question:<br />Would the government please clarify sections 5.5.1, 5.5.2, and 5.5.3, e.g., can one assume that the government is interested in receiving a recommendation based on task orders performed at the contractor site rather than at the government site?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />Task orders performed at the contractor site.</p>
<p>38. Question:<br />How is the Small Business plan looking like?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The government intends to maximize opportunities for small and small disadvantaged businesses in the upcoming GWAC. In finalizing a small business approach to include in the RFP, the government, through this RFI, is looking to industry for ideas on ways to maximize such opportunities for small and small disadvantaged business. Two pertinent questions in the RFI follow:</p>
<p>5.1.3 To maximize opportunities for small (SB) and small disadvantaged business (SDB), NIH is considering the possibility of having a separate bidding category for task orders that are set aside for SB and SDB. Do you think this is a necessary feature to improve opportunities for small businesses? Are there other ways NIH can improve opportunities for SDBs?</p>
<p>5.1.4 How should NIH best incorporate small business into the sourcing strategy that will provide maximum opportunities for the various small business categories, such as woman-owned, service disabled veteran owned, small disadvantaged, HubZone, etc.?</p>
<p>39. Question:<br />Would the government please clarify section 5.1.5? Are you looking for incentives for Large Businesses to meet subcontracting goals, or incentives for Small Disadvantaged Businesses during competition such as a percentage pricing incentive?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />NITAAC is seeking recommendations on ways to maximize opportunities for small business and small disadvantaged business, both at the prime contract level and through subcontracting opportunities.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program produces and distributes water information through several outreach activities as a part of the Federal Advisory Committee Act-designated Advisory Committee on Water Information. NAWQA's technical assessments of the health of selected river systems and principal aquifers across our Nation yield valuable information on water resources to the public and private sector.

NAWQA has an existing active outreach effort, and seeks venues to communicate its findings as efficiently, effectively, and successfully as possible to the public and private sector. To meet these requirements, NAWQA draws upon its own staff and other Federal and non-Federal subject matter experts. USGS has a requirement for an experienced private sector subject matter expert to help NAWQA meet its directive to be relevant, to share information, and to incorporate ideas and outside input into future NAWQA assessments. The subject matter expert will be required to provide advice, and coordinate and conduct several meetings, briefings, and interactions between NAWQA and Federal, non-Federal, and private interest users of water-quality information. The contractor must have proven experience in all phases of planning and coordinating large technical meetings with diverse audiences. The contractor must have a specific and unique knowledge of past, present and future water quality issues and must possess an extensive understanding of the NAWQA program and its science activities. The contractor must also have extensive experience working with the National Liaison Committee and other national groups interested in and responsible for water quality issues. 

The Government anticipates award of a non-commercial, definite quantity, Firm Fixed Price type contract. The procurement is anticipated to be for a base year with four one-year option periods. This is a follow-on effort. The incumbent contractor is Judy Campbell Bird of Chevy Chase, MD. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 and the size standard is $6.5M. This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside. See Numbered Note 1 and 26.

All responsible sources meeting the Government's requirement are invited to submit a proposal under the resulting solicitation. A formal solicitation, to include the performance work statement, is not available for release at this time. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet on or about 23 June 2008. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments. No paper distribution of these documents will be provided. 

All questions and concerns may be submitted to the contracting officer via email only at jkelley@usgs.gov. This is not a request for proposals.
