The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain.

While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance. The required delivery is 90 days. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in US dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA).

The Naval Sea Systems Command plans to award delivery orders under Basic Ordering Agreement Number N00024-12-G-4329, on an other than full and open competition basis, to Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors (LM MS2), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for Post-Interim support for the LCS 1 and LCS 3.
 Efforts will include execution and advance planning of Continuous Maintenance Availabilities (CMAV), Continuous Maintenance (CM), Emergent Maintenance (EM), Planned Maintenance System (PMS) Planning and Execution, Facilities Maintenance (FM), Administration and Engineering Support Services (AESS), and class planning and support services. These delivery orders will bridge the gap between interim support services, currently being performed under contracts N00024-03-C-2311 and N00024-09-C-2303, and the competitive award of a Product Support Plan (PSP) contract.  As the shipbuilder of the LCS 1 variant, LM MS2 is the only known source with extensive previous experience necessary to perform these efforts and has developed unique and technical expertise for the design, engineering, construction, and maintenance of these ships.
  LM MS2 is the only known source capable of providing coverage in order to prevent possible disruption in services and unacceptable delays in mission critical efforts necessary to restore or maintain the ship to a fully operational level required to support the Fleet.

The statutory authority for the sole source is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

The subsequent revision to any specification or RFP based on comments received remains solely at the Government's discretion.

<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a non-commercial, sole source, firm-fixed Price (FFP), five year, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract with DRS Laurel Technologies, 246 Airport Road, Johnstown, PA 15904. The procurement will be for a minimum quantity of one (1) and a maximum quantity of 30 over the five year ordering period. The Government has a requirement for 7 DRS Laurel Technologies installation check out spares for the AN/SLQ-32(V)6, part numbers, drawing numbers: 1010211-1 _34EA9-1010211M_Common Electronic module, 1010295-1_5998-01-586-9405_Circuit Card Electronic Module, 1010295-2_5998-01586-9956_Storage Module,1010295-3_5998-01-586-9983_Media Module, 1010295-4_5998-01-586-9968_Central Processing unit Module, 1010295-5_5998-01-586-9980_Input/Output module, and 1010298-6_5998-01-586-9469_Power module. DRS Laurel Technologies parts are approved and required for use in the SEWIP 1B3 which is a key component in the assembly of the AN/SLQ-32(V) 6. They have been verified to meet the specification requirements through extensive engineering tests. The Government does not possess a complete technical data package to compete this action. A competitive procurement approach would require extensive cost duplication for non-recurring engineering and product validation and an unacceptable delay in schedule to meet requirement needs. The effort will not be set aside for small business concerns.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has a requirement to perform post-production modifications (missionization) on newly delivered C-130J aircraft. The Missionization effort involves nose-to-tail modifications to the aircraft to incorporate the next-generation Minotaur Mission System Suite (MSS+) as well as the radar, sensors, and remaining C4ISR equipment that will enable aircrew to gather and process surveillance information for transmission to other shore and surface operators. <br /><br />Additionally, existing HC-130J aircraft (already missionized) must undergo modifications to be retrofitted with the MSS+ solution. These aircraft currently contain a legacy Mission System Suite (MSS) that is no longer procurable in its current configuration and has become economically unsupportable due to diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) and material obsolescence. Removing the legacy MSS and incorporating the MSS+ on these aircraft will significantly mitigate the effects of both hardware and software obsolescence, plus offer an increase in Mission System performance over the legacy MSS. <br /><br />USCG plans to issue one competitive solicitation through FedBizOpps by the end of this calendar year 2014.

<p>Description:<br />The following program descriptions are offered to provide more in-depth information on STEM areas of interest to the Office of Environmental Management. Specific areas of research interest are identified in each Sub-Program Priority Areas and Research Needs list.</p>
<p>1. Site Restoration<br />Program Website: http://energy.gov/em/services/site-facility-restoration<br /><br />The mission of the Site Restoration program is to provide integration, planning and analysis for all soil and groundwater remediation, deactivation and decommissioning (D&amp;D) and facility engineering.</p>
<p>The Site Restoration subprograms and their objectives follow: <br /><br />Soil and Groundwater<br />The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) manages the largest groundwater and soil remediation effort in the world. The inventory at the DOE sites includes 6.5 trillion liters of contaminated groundwater, an amount equal to about four times the daily U.S. water consumption, and 40 million cubic meters of soil and debris contaminated with radionuclides, metals, and organics. At the large sites such as Hanford (Richland, WA), Savannah River (Aiken, SC), and Oak Ridge (Oak Ridge, TN), the Office of Soil and Groundwater Remediation has conducted research and demonstration projects to test new technologies and remediation approaches. These initiatives are developing remediation alternatives ranging from active engineered systems to natural attenuation to address a variety of DOE-EM contaminants. They are being integrated into a systems-based, risk-informed, remediation framework that is being applied across the DOE-EM complex.</p>
<p>R&amp;D can include characterization and monitoring; stabilization, remediation and processing; and modeling, visualization and analysis. The goal of research and technology development activities is to deliver approaches and technologies from highly leveraged and strategic investments that maximize the reduction of risk and life-cycle cleanup costs.</p>
<p>Sub-Program Priority Areas (PA), Research Needs (RN), and Conditions (C):</p>
<p>PA1: Attenuation Based Remedies for the Subsurface<br />RN1: R&amp;D leading to solutions to address subsurface metal and radionuclide contamination and recalcitrant organics<br />C1: Research should complement or extend the work of the Attenuation Based Remedies (ABRS) for the Subsurface Applied Field Research Initiative (AFRI), located at the Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina for (http://energy.gov/em/attenuation-based-remedies-subsurface-applied-field-research-initiative-abrs-afri)</p>
<p>PA2: Deep Vadose Zone<br />RN2: R&amp;D leading to improved characterization, remediation, monitoring, and prediction for the deep vadose zone<br />C2: Research should complement or extend the work of the Deep Vadose Zone AFRI, located on the Hanford Site in Richland, Washington (http://www.pnl.gov/arm-em32/)</p>
<p>PA3: Remediation of Mercury and Industrial Contaminants<br />RN3: R&amp;D leading to the control of the flux of contaminants in soil and water environments<br />C3: Research should complement or extend the work of the Remediation of Mercury and Industrial Contaminants (ROMIC) AFRI, based at the Oak Ridge Reservation in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that focuses on protecting surface water, groundwater, and ecological receptors (http://www.esd.ornl.gov/romic_afrc/index.shtml)</p>
<p>PA4: Advanced Simulation Capability for Environmental Management (ASCEM)<br />RN4: R&amp;D leading to modular and extensible modeling for multi-phase, multi-component, multi-scale subsurface flow and contaminant transport, and source-term degradation <br />C4: Research should support development of a modular and extensible open-source, high performance computing modeling system that enables robust and standardized future performance and risk assessments for EM cleanup and closure activities (http://esd.lbl.gov/research/projects/ascem/)</p>
<p><br />Deactivation &amp; Decommissioning<br />Deactivation and Decommissioning (D&amp;D) is the process of taking an active/excess/abandoned facility to a final disposition end state. Because of residual radioactivity, other hazardous constituents, and the physical condition of EM's facilities, D&amp;D presents unique hazards that must be addressed from a safety, programmatic, environmental, and technological standpoint. The general D&amp;D process applies to all facilities across the EM complex. The D&amp;D function with the Office of D&amp;D and Facility Engineering focusses on innovative applications and timely insertion of existing commercially available technologies, processes and hardware to identify and address D&amp;D risks and challenges. The program supports the development of informed facility D&amp;D strategy such as In-Situ Decommissioning, enhanced verifiability of the efficacy of D&amp;D operations, increased productivity and personnel safety of D&amp;D operation, facilitation of acceptable facility end-states, and independent verification.</p>
<p>Sub-Program Priority Areas (PA), Research Needs (RN), and Conditions (C):</p>
<p>PA1: Unique sensor networks for remote monitoring of entombed facilities and tanks<br />RN1: R&amp;D leading to the development and deployment of these networks<br />C1: Research should extend techniques already developed at DOE labs</p>
<p>PA2: Interactions between radiological and chemical contaminants of concern to DOE (e.g. plutonium, cesium, mercury, etc.) and facility materials (e.g. concrete, steel, nickel, etc.)<br />RN2: R&amp;D leading to a better scientific understanding of these interactions<br />C2: Scientific understanding should support the subsequent development of cost effective methods to decontaminate facility materials</p>
<p>PA3: Incombustible fixatives and decontamination agents<br />RN3: R&amp;D leading to the development of these fixatives and agents<br />C3: (None specified)</p>
<p>PA4: Acceptability of DeconGel and various contaminant mixtures<br />RN4: Testing protocols to demonstrate the acceptance <br />C4: Protocols should be applicable to various DOE facilities</p>
<p>PA5: Robotics and remote systems with plug-and-play interchangeable components<br />RN5: R&amp;D leading to the development of these components<br />C5: Research should support component development with application in highly radioactive environments</p>
<p>PA6: Models for facility decommissioning <br />RN6: R&amp;D leading to model development<br />C6: Research could include modeling of degradation and its effects on decommissioning scope and costs</p>
<p>2. Tank Waste<br />Program Website: http://energy.gov/em/services/waste-management/tank-waste-and-waste-processing</p>
<p>EM is dedicated to safely disposing of waste and seeks cost effective and environmentally responsible project execution methods. EM offices that focus on waste management provide leadership in planning and executing EM programs for the storage, retrieval, pretreatment, treatment, and final preparation of nuclear materials for disposal and tank closure planning.</p>
<p>Tank Waste and Waste Processing <br />The Department has approximately 88 million gallons of liquid waste stored in underground tanks and approximately 4,000 cubic meters of solid waste derived from the liquids stored in bins. The current DOE estimated cost for retrieval, treatment and disposal of this waste exceeds $50 billion to be spent over several decades. The highly radioactive portion of this waste, located at the Hanford Site, Idaho National Laboratory, and Savannah River Site, must be treated, immobilized, and prepared for shipment to a waste repository. Efforts currently focus on improving pre-treatment to reduce the amount of waste that must be disposed, retrieval technologies, vitrification performance, and breakthrough immobilization technologies.</p>
<p>Sub-Program Priority Areas (PA), Research Needs (RN), and Conditions (C):</p>
<p>PA1: Current DOE tank waste and waste processing approaches<br />RN1: R&amp;D leading to the development of technology improvements that address technology gaps or optimize the current DOE flow sheets<br />C1: Research should be in at least one of the following areas: Characterization of Physical and Chemical Properties; Improvement in Slurry Transport, Mixing, and Flammability Control; Refining the Separations Processes; and Optimizing Processing Facilities and Waste Forms</p>
<p>PA2: Alternative DOE tank waste processing options<br />RN2: R&amp;D leading to addressing challenges to alternative processes, to eliminate the need for new massive facilities, to start waste treatment operations sooner, and to accelerate reduction of hazards from materials stored in tanks<br />C2: Research should be in at least one of the following areas: Development of Alternative Separations Methods and Deployment Strategies, Development of Alternative Waste Forms and Processes</p>
<p>PA3: Tank Management and Closure<br />RN3: R&amp;D leading to improved tank integrity, and water intrusion detection and leak detection. Closure objectives include achieving retrieval goals, developing protocols for residual waste characterization and immobilization, establishing barriers to release of constituents of interest, and development of closure materials<br />C3: Research should be in at least one of the following areas: Improvement in tank leak and intrusion&nbsp; detection and mitigation; improvement in in situ sampling, analysis, characterization, and&nbsp;monitoring for tank closure; development of retrieval method alternatives (mechanical and chemical); and improvement in the technical basis for closure and performance assessments</p>

<DESC><p>Sources Sought Synopsis</p>
<p>F-16 Program Office<br />Fighter/Bomber Directorate<br />Air Force Life Cycle Management Center<br />Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</p>
<p>1. Description</p>
<p>1.1 The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Fighter/Bomber Directorate (WW), F-16 Program Contracting Office (WWMK), Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking information on a sustainment upgrade or replacement for the current United States Air Force (USAF) F-16 Blocks 40/42/50/52 Programmable Display Generator (PDG).</p>
<p>1.2 Specifically, the F-16 program office is requesting information on a PDG sustainment upgrade or replacement that can be retrofitted onto the existing USAF F-16 Blocks 40/42/50/52 aircraft without exceeding the current Size Weight and Power Cooling (SWaPC) capabilities. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this potential work is 334511: Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, size standard 750 employees.</p>
<p>2. This Is A Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) Only</p>
<p>2.1 This SSS is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This SSS does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.</p>
<p>2.2 The Air Force is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this SSS. All costs associated with responding to this SSS will be solely at the interested parties' expense.</p>
<p>2.3 Responders shall describe how they meet the requirements listed under the Requirements Description and must fully answer the Contractor Capability Survey portions - Part 1 and Part 2.</p>
<p>2.4 Contractors must be either U.S.-owned or a U.S.-owned subsidiary with valid security infrastructure and clearances to accomplish this effort. Large businesses are encouraged to indicate the extent to which they intend to use small businesses.</p>
<p>2.5 The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>3. If there is sufficient demonstrated interested and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a response as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>4. Note that, if this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentages.</p>
<p>5. If a company is capable of some, but not all of the consolidated requirements stated in this SSS, please provide a response that explains the requirements for which you are capable.</p>
<p>6. Not responding to this SSS does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website. It is the responsibility of the potential respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>7. Background</p>
<p>7.1 The PDG provides the ability to drive the displays on the F-16. The Government is investigating the possibility of initiating a USAF F-16 PDG sustainment upgrade or replacement program. The objective would be to develop, produce, and field an upgraded PDG system to address operational requirements and supportability issues, with development beginning in 2015 and production beginning in 2019.</p>
<p>7.2 F-16 combat capabilities have expanded to reach the video processing limits of the current PDG. This PDG upgrade supports future Operational Flight Program (OFP) software sustainment upgrades and will support displaying critical operational information. The current PDG cannot handle the volume of operational information in dynamic mission environments. As a result, it is unable to drive modern cockpit displays or support high definition video; due to memory, throughput, and interface limitations, displays routinely blank critical operational information during high track/data density mission scenarios. Critical components of the PDG are suffering Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, including memory components. Upgraded PDG is required to address the digital display/video processing limitations and support modern high definition displays with sufficient memory and throughput to provide properly functioning displays through the entire dynamic envelope of the aircraft to support future operational capabilities.</p>
<p>7.3 Due to security access, system attributes, and concept of operations, foreign contractor participation is not permitted at the prime contractor level. United States contractors must develop the PDG in the United States of America.</p>
<p>7.4 The planned production is estimated to be 700 PDGs, including spares and trainers.</p>
<p>8. Security requirements will be in accordance with the F-16 Security Classification Guide (SCG) and any other applicable classification guides. Please contact F-16 Program Office if you require a copy of the SCG.</p>
<p>9. Industry Discussions: AFLCMC/WWM representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential respondents. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements.</p>
<p>10. On the following pages is a description of the PDG upgrade requirements and a Contractor Capability Survey which allows you to provide your company's capability.<br />11. If, after reviewing this information, you desire to respond to the SSS, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability to meet these requirements. Companies may be contacted for further information or clarification; however, failure to provide documentation may result in the U.S. Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how your company would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.). Documentation should be provided in the form of a white paper.</p>
<p>12. Questions related to this market survey should be addressed to the Program Manager, John Weyrick, at 937-713-6515 or the Contracting Officer, Christopher Hampton, at 937-713-6996. Questions regarding classified communications shall be addressed by the Security Officer, Ms. Rachel Garcia at (unclassified) 937-904-7735, for directions to a classified phone line.</p>
<p>13. Please include two complete hard copies of the response, no longer than 25 pages each, along with one softcopy on compact disk-read only. In addition, please send one copy by e-mail no later than close of business 30 calendar days after posting date, to the Contracting Officer, Christopher Hampton, at christophe.hampton@us.af.mil, and to the Contracts Negotiator, Christopher Rittenhouse, at christopher.rittenhouse@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>13.1 AFLCMC / WWMK<br />Attn: Christopher Hampton <br />2725 C Street Bldg. 553<br />Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433</p>

<SUBJECT>58--Retrofit of the AN/TPQ-53 Initial Production (IP) Radar Systems - Sources Sought
<SOLNBR>W56KGY-15-R-KC02
<RESPDATE>122314
<ARCHDATE>02072015
<CONTACT>Kevin Cook, 443-861-5375

<a href="mailto:kevin.j.cook2.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Aberdeen Division C </a>
<DESC> <br> This SSA is being issued to obtain information from interested sources regarding their ability to satisfy the requirements for the retrofit of 19 AN/TPQ-53 IP Radar Systems, program management support, and the system and production acceptance testing (SAT and PAT) of each retrofitted system. <br>  <br> The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSA, or to otherwise pay for the information requested.  This SSA shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, or request for proposal.  It shall not be used as the basis for a proposal. <br>  <br> The Government anticipates retrofit will be accomplished under a firm fixed price (FFP) delivery order (DO) issued under the Global Tactical Advanced Communications System (GTACS) contract W15P7T-13-D-0010.  The draft PWS is attached to this announcement.  The AN/TPQ-53 Performance Specification (77A582901) is available upon request.  <br>  <br> Program Overview: <br>  <br> The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System will serve as the Army's replacement for the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Radar Systems.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System shall satisfy known, current, and future force concept requirements by interfacing with the global information grid and future force battle command systems.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System provides the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counter-battery target acquisition for all types and phases of military operations.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System is a highly mobile radar that will detect projectiles in-flight, as well as determine and communicate the firing point location of rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM).  It will be deployable and capable of operation in varying terrain and climatic conditions.  The system shall provide both 90 and 360 degree azimuth detection coverage against all threats at increased ranges, enhanced human machine interface, ease of programmability, and built-in capacity for growth.  It also will accurately locate and classify hostile weapon locations at greater ranges and coverage patterns to permit more effective detection and counter-battery fires.    <br>  <br> Current and future forces have a critical and immediate need for a RAM locating system that provides 360 degree detection coverage to mitigate capability gaps in force protection and target detection.  Current indirect fire detection systems lack the mobility and agility to meet the requirements of the supported force and are too large and slow to support units in all types of military operations.  Brigade combat teams and field artillery brigades must quickly secure the operational area and the current counter fire systems introduce unnecessary risk to operations.  <br>  <br> Request for Information: <br>  <br> In providing your response to this announcement, please ensure you address all of the following questions as well as provide any additional data/information you feel necessary for the Government to assess your capabilities in support of the retrofit. <br>  <br> 1)  Company name, cage code, point of contact and point of contact email address. <br>  <br> 2)   State whether your firm is interested in participating as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor on the AN/TPQ-53 radar contract.  Companies that intend to be a prime contractor should clearly demonstrate that they possess the technology, design and production capabilities to meet the specified requirements.  Any small business interested in participating as the prime contractor should clearly articulate their plan to satisfy the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  <br>  <br> 3)  State whether your company is considered a Large or Small Business in relation to North American Industry Classification System Code 334511-Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing.  Small businesses must identify any applicable socio-economic categories such as small disadvantaged business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, 8(a), woman owned small business, etc.  <br>  <br> 4)  Identify potential partner/teaming arrangements or joint ventures that may be pursued to meet AN/TPQ-53 IP Radar retrofit requirements.  <br>  <br> 5)  Summarize relevant experience with radar technologies.  Identify any systems in development, systems planned for development, or fielded systems that may be used or leveraged to satisfy the requirements of the AN/TPQ-53 Performance Specification (77A582901).   <br>  <br> 6)  Describe production and manufacturing capacity.  Identify the length of time after contract award that production representative IP retrofit systems will be available for acceptance testing.  Identify the minimum, maximum and optimal monthly production rate for the proposed system.  Identify the lead time required to achieve each of these production rates.  <br>  <br> 7)  Clearly identify assumptions on which your response is predicated.  As a minimum, identify any required GFE/GFI on which the approach is predicated, and all required Government support anticipated.  <br>  <br> 8)  Provide a milestone schedule for accomplishing the system retrofits. The period of performance in 36 months. <br>  <br> 9)  Identify major cost drivers for this action.  <br>  <br> 10)  Provide any other relevant information you wish to share regarding your ability to satisfy the AN/TPQ-53 IP requirements.  <br>  <br> Submittal: <br>  <br> Company information will be verified via the System for Award Management (SAM)  <br> data base.  Responses to this RFI/SSA must be unclassified, and must not exceed 12 pages in length (includes cover page, and table of contents) with fonts no smaller than 11 point, and one inch margins.

<DESC>Description(s): <br>  <br> A.  INTRODUCTION <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this RFI is to gain information leading to Government/Industry partnering to accelerate the development of technologies that will enable the Warfighter to be more effective, efficient and lethal.  <br>  <br> The Expeditionary-Adaptive Red Team /Technical Support and Operational Analysis (Ex-ART/TSOA) invites industry, academia, individuals, and labs to submit technology demonstration papers addressing innovative technologies and capabilities that can be used in challenging environments: <br>   Physical (Terrain -Natural and Urban) <br>   Electronic (frequency congestion & overload) <br>   Contested (electronic interference & cyber attacks)   <br>  <br> The Ex-ART team supports the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)) to improve Warfighter maneuver, survivability and lethality. The Ex-ART team indentifies potential vulnerabilities in emerging technologies including performance degradation in contested environments, interoperability, adaptability and training/ease of use through live experiment venues. <br>  <br> After reviewing the technology demonstration paper submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to demonstrate their capabilities in an Ex-ART/TSOA assessment venue in which we evaluate the capability as applied to the Warfighter, its technical limitations and vulnerabilities.  These assessments will be held quarterly at various venues to include, but not limited to, Camp Roberts Army National Guard Base, Playas Regional Training Center (PRTC), Camp Blanding, FL, Fort AP Hill, VA, Camp Atterbury, IN, Stennis, MS and Port Canaveral, FL through 31 December 2015.  These assessments will provide the submitter an opportunity to interact with the Warfighter, the DoD Science and Technology community, academia, Combatant Commands (COCOMS), Theatre Special Operations Commands (TSOCs)and Federal Agencies for the purpose of assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on missions and capabilities. <br>  <br> Technology Demonstration papers shall be submitted electronically to email address: john.p.klopfenstein.civ@mail.mil.  The subject line of the email must indicate  quote mark Ex-ART/TSOA, quote mark  followed by the submitting organization's name. This RFI is effective through 31 December 2015.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice
<p>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) is seeking sources to perform a research and development (R&amp;D) project in support of the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD. The research project will extend the existing capability of physicians to treat patients with life threatening traumatic brain injury (TBI) and possibly increase the threshold for the safe cerebral perfusion pressure. The University of Miami is the only entity to have conducted the prior, Office of Naval Research funded effort. This project is for an already approved FDA drug which has not yet been approved for the treatment of TBI or cerebral perfusion pressure. The objective of the project is to pursue a new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indication that will support the treatment of Marines and Sailors wounded in the field. The estimated period of performance of the project is 36 months.</p>
<p>If capable sources are not identified through this notice, then NMLC intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Kenneth G. Proctor, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine; Daughtry Department of Surgery; 1800 NW 10th Ave Ryder Trauma Center Miami, FL 33136 for the performance of the described requirement.</p>
<p>The research group at the University of Miami conducted the prior clinical study at a major trauma hospital and has the data to support advancement of this research effort into clinical practice. This project is an extension of an Office of Naval Research sponsored grant that has been conducted for the past 5 years. Over the course of five years, the University of Miami completed a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled non-inferiority clinical trial (Clinical Trial Identifier NCT00795366). In addition, the University of Miami also initiated a retrospective data analysis in non-randomized patient records. The purpose of this effort is to complete the review of both the prospective and retrospective data collection to support the FDA application.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 1 (8.5 x 11 inch) page using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 5:00 PM Eastern Time, 24 December, 2014. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: Ronald.Sanford@med.navy.mil.</p>

<p>&bull; Establishment and management of the Sustainable Pavements Technical Working Group (SP TWG). The SP TWG is composed of stakeholders in State DOT's, other government agencies, academia, and industry. The group provides technical input on the subject of pavement sustainability.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of a reference document on sustainable pavements and materials. The document titled "Towards Sustainable Pavements: A Reference Manual" (under final review) will provide guidelines for the design, construction, preservation, and maintenance of sustainable asphalt and concrete pavements.</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluation and assessment of sustainable tools. Currently developing a framework outlining how to conduct a pavement Life Cycle Assessment to quantify the environmental impacts of a pavement.</p>
<p>&bull; Technology transfer and deployment. Activities such as development of Tech Briefs, conducting workshops, presentations, webinars, and updating the FHWA pavement website with information pertaining to the Sustainable Pavements Program.</p>

<p>The TSE system is a web based program which permits users to dynamically generate and visualize U.S. international trade statistics over the Web. Visitors to the TSE website can select and extract U.S. trade data records tailored to their needs, view results in tables and on thematically color-shaded maps, download requested data, download map images, and print maps and tables as needed. The system uses MapInfo's MapXtreme<sup>TM</sup> software for Microsoft.Net, which displays interactive thematic maps on a .Net webpage using trade data stored in a Microsoft SQL Server database. The TSE system was expanded to include the following applications: TSE, TradeStats Express Plus (TSE+), the State Imports Database, Metropolitan Export Data series, Exporter Database, Export Related Employment.<br />TPIS is an Oracle database and web based retrieval system providing access to a number of (logical) trade and economic databases all open to government users via authentication and access to a number of dynamic data-driven web forms and pages open to the public without authentication. TPIS is built on an Oracle 11g database server platform with the bulk of the functionality for the retrieval system coded in Oracle's PL/SQL. Backups of the databases to disk are performed using Oracle's RMAN, and other data and files outside of the Oracle databases are backed up to tape using a commercial backup package. Structurally, TPIS utilizes two instances of Oracle 11g databases: one database instance, called TPISDB07, houses the bulk of the TPIS (logical) international databases, about 700 GB of data in a single Oracle instance; a smaller database instance of about 100GB, called TPISDB06, is used primarily to run the perl-cgi interface to the web-based code, to submit remote requests to the pl/sql procedures on TPISDB07. The primary government Web interfaces for TPIS for authenticated government users is a combination of 1) perl cgi data-driven web forms that submit requests for asynchronous "jobs" run on PL/SQL procedures on TPISDB07, and 2) some web forms coded primarily in C# from Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVS) 2010 to provide access to the public and the government via Oracle database content in data-driven dynamic web forms and pages. Most of the data in the TSE system are transferred through the TPIS system before loading into the TSE system. Both the Oracle database and web servers run on Windows 2008 Server platforms, using IIS as the web site.<br />The purpose of this sources sought is to obtain information on the following mission support services for the Office of Trade and Economic Analysis (OTEA) identified as the following: <br />(1) provision of on-going maintenance of the TSE system; <br />(2) additional services in support of the further development and enhancement of the TSE system; <br />(3) conduct an assessment of existing systems and create design plan for transition of systems to a vendor supplied and supported cloud environment; <br />4) move and maintain the TSE system (GIS software, custom software (C#, t-sql, etc), MS SQL Server 2008 or higher databases) to a vendor-supplied-and-supported cloud environment, the database being 200GB or less along with a good deal of raw data storage; and <br />(5) move and maintain the TPIS system and Oracle databases to a vendor-supplied-and-supported cloud environment, two oracle databases totaling a terabyte of storage, raw data of at least 2 terabytes and space to run RMAN backups to disk and to store database archive logs.</p>
<p>1. Maintenance: OTEA requires annual maintenance. Annual Maintenance support includes the following: <br />a. Application Software Support: Provide continuous engineering support for the TSE system so as to avert disruption of essential agency functions over the course of the contract. This includes but is not limited to modifying the TSE system applications as needed to cope with the evolution of operating system, database, web browser and web server software. It also includes implementing MapXtreme/Pitney Bowes patches to the TSE system applications where necessary and providing application support to ensure sustained system operations. The contractor shall perform additional as needed application and data management support during the contract performance period in order to facilitate updates to the TSE system applications content and ensure that all source data is processed into formats fully compatible with TSE and Emporio application code.</p>
<p>b. Troubleshooting: Provide diagnostic services and remedial assistance as needed to maintain system availability during normal business hours. Modify custom application programs in MS SQL Server, MS .NET, and MapXtreme for .Net as needed to ensure stable system operations and avert disruption of essential agency functions.</p>
<p>2. Additional Application and Data Management Services: These services are identified as upgrading existing functionality and adding new functionality. In addition, it may include services which are not included in the FFP for maintenance above. Services in support of new functionality may require future modifications of applications in MS SQL Server, MS .NET, and MapXtreme for .Net code. Services required under this area will be performed on a labor hour basis. <br />a. Support may include correcting errors discovered during validation testing requiring intervention caused by bad data (incorrect format, incorrect data, missing data that is expected), correcting errors discovered during validation testing that require intervention of third party (i.e. US Census) to correct, and make changes to the software application, outside of previously defined application design.</p>
<p>b. Application development services in support of additional components to be incorporated into the system may include; but is not limited to: functional design documents, optimization of system performance, load testing and the development and deployment of newly available trade data, and code changes to support source data format changes. Services are required to modify application programs in MS SQL Server, MS .NET, and MapXtreme for .Net when necessary to add new functionality to the TSE system.</p>
<p>c. All functional design documents shall at a minimum includes application functionality, application design, and screen mock-ups.</p>
<p>3. Assessment and Design: Conduct an assessment of existing systems and create design plan for transition of systems to a vendor supplied and supported cloud environment. OTEA requires technical documentation to be created for the TSE and TPIS systems:<br />a. A technical overview of the TSE and TPIS systems (including technical specifications of the existing systems, existing server infrastructure, dependencies on other agency resources, etc.).</p>
<p>b. Design of vendor supplied and supported cloud environment including a proposal for a cloud platform, technical design (including documentation of proposed server and network layout with diagrams), and an estimated cost structure to include both initial set-up costs as well as recurring annual costs for maintenance of the system.</p>
<p>c. Create a project plan for implementation including step-by-step procedures and timeline for cloud environment set-up, transition of systems to the cloud environment, migration of data, establishment of procedures for regular data maintenance, and conversion of the live site (including set-up of the .gov address, etc.).</p>
<p>4. Cloud Environment: Move and maintain the TSE System in the Cloud. Provide an appropriate "Cloud" Environment, per the approved design and project implementation plan, and move the TSE system from its current data center location to an equivalent cloud location and maintain the MS SQL Server Database Software and TSE system at the new location. Moving TSE would entail taking a copy of the MS SQL Server 2008 databases and the related C#, MAPXTREME, html and other files and software and moving them to "cloud" servers. Provide and Configure MS SQL SERVER database services and IIS Web servers and get the transferred TSE system to work in the new cloud environment. TSE is a highly customized system where maintenance of the customized software (C#, t-sql, javascript, css, maxextreme code, and related configuration and support files) will be maintained by the contractor once the contractor makes the transferred system fully operational. The contractor will be responsible at a minimum for the maintenance of 1) MS SQL SERVER Patches &amp; upgrades, 2) IIS and OS patches and upgrades, 3) performing backups of the Databases, 4) backing up all software and files not covered by the SQL SERVER database backups.<br />5. Cloud Environment: Move and maintain the TPIS System in the Cloud.<br />Provide an appropriate "Cloud" Environment, per the approved design and project implementation plan, and move the TPIS system from its current data center location to an equivalent cloud location and maintain the Oracle Database Software and TPIS system at the new location. Moving TPIS would entail taking a copy of the database instances (probably in RMAN) and the related perl, cgi or other files and software and moving them to "cloud" servers. Provide and configure Oracle database 11g or higher services and IIS Web servers and get the transferred system to work in the new cloud environment, including getting the perl cgi and MSVS C# *.aspx web pages to work in IIS or other web server. TPIS is a highly customized system where monthly data loading and maintenance of the customized software (PL/SQL, C#, perl cgi, ...) will be maintained by TPIS staff once the contractor makes the transferred system fully operational. The contractor will be responsible at a minimum for the maintenance of 1) Oracle Operation, Patches &amp; upgrades, 2) IIS web server and OS patches and upgrades, 3) performing or supporting RMAN backups of the Oracle databases to disk, 4) backing up all software and files not covered by the RMAN Oracle database backups, 5) periodically backing up the RMAN backups to disk to tape or other media and storing copies off-site for disaster recovery purposes.<br />The DOC is requesting that interested contractors provide a brief capability/information statement demonstrating their ability to provide this service and provide the following information:<br />The statement of capabilities should include:</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), is seeking capability statements from Small Business organizations to continue the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, a national longitudinal cohort study on tobacco use behavior and health designed to enhance the evidence base that informs the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulatory actions under the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (TCA). The TCA provides FDA authority to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products in the United States to protect public health. These regulatory changes are expected to influence tobacco product use patterns, attitudes and beliefs, and exposures, and to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality over time.
<p><br />This continuation of the PATH Study includes Wave 4, scheduled to launch on October 16, 2016, as well as Waves 5, 6, and 7. Each full wave of data collection will be conducted over a 1-year (12 months) period on a biennial basis (e.g., Wave 4 in 2016, Wave 5 in 2018, Wave 6 in 2020, and Wave 7 in 2022). Additional requirements of this continuation include, but are not limited to the following for Wave 4 and potentially for future waves: (1)  the probability-based replenishment of the cohort to equal at least the baseline sample size (i.e., an estimated 46,000 adults and youth); (2) the establishment and maintenance of  a shadow sample (i.e., at least 7,000 youth ages 9-to-11 years) from which to populate aged-up youth at each wave; (3) the collection of bio-specimens, including urine samples among youth and blood and urine samples among adults; (4) at least 50 Ad hoc studies; (5) cognitive testing and methodological studies to inform questionnaire development and to assess alternate modes of interview administration, such as web-based interview administration; and (6) the development of Information Collection Requests (ICRs) for review and approval by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p>This is a SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of ALL small businesses (e.g., 8(a), Veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled Veteran-owned small businesses, HUB Zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and other small businesses) having the in-house capability and multi-disciplinary knowledge, expertise, and experience required to continue the PATH Study, as described above.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 541712.</p>
<p>In addition to demonstrating the above capabilities, information sent should be relevant and specific in the technical area under consideration on each of the following qualifications: 1) Experience: An outline of previous similar projects, specifically the techniques employed in the areas described above, and 2) Personnel: name, professional qualifications, and specific experience in the work requested.

The purpose of this RFI is to accomplish market research regarding technical security equipment and systems pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, and to identify businesses capable of performing the functions described herein. The government is requesting information regarding the availability and feasibility of attracting new equipment providers to support the requirements of the Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), Office of Security Technology (ST), as described in this RFI. This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment on the part of the government to conduct a solicitation for the below-listed services in the future. Responders are advised that the government will not pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, nor will it compensate responders for any costs incurred in the development/furnishing of a response.
<p>Please note that a decision not to submit a response to this RFI will not preclude a vendor from participating in any future solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Background</strong></p>
<p>The Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) is the law enforcement and security arm of the U.S. Department of State (DoS). DS is responsible for providing a safe and secure environment for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy. All Foreign Service posts (embassies, consulates-general, consulates, et al.) operate with technical and physical security programs designed and maintained by DS. In general terms, DS is responsible for direct, recurring support for physical and technical security programs at some 270 overseas Foreign Service posts. The Office of Security Technology (ST) has the key role in ensuring that overseas technical and physical security systems are installed, maintained, repaired, upgraded, and monitored.</p>
<p>In support of these responsibilities, DS routinely uses a physical Intrusion Detection System (IDS), more commonly referred to as an "alarm system", to monitor offices and other areas inside DoS facilities. This monitoring is intended to detect unauthorized physical entry. For the purposes of this RFI, the IDS consists of a controller, keypad to arm/disarm, power supplies, alarm point inputs and relay outputs, all of which are installed in the monitored space. Sensors, such as motion detectors and magnetic switches, are NOT included in this RFI. Point-to-point encryption (between the controller and the associated sensors/keypad) is not required for this system, but is preferred.</p>
<p>DS is seeking commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products for this application. While potential vendors may suggest an item that is a modification of an existing product, the requirement of any future procurement will be a COTS product that is available for sale to the U.S. government or a U.S. government contractor or sub-contractor, in single-piece quantities.</p>
<p><strong>3.0	Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>At this time, there is no requirement for a facility security clearance or cleared staff under the National Industrial Security Program. However, if a respondent participates in the National Industrial Security Program and has facility and personnel clearances, that information should be provided in the response. The company must have a robust technical support group to support user, installation and repair documentation; technical and software updates/revisions; and training, as may be needed by the U.S. government.</p>
<p><strong>4.0 Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Diplomatic Security seeks an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to alert personnel, display, communicate, and maintain a record of security events.</p>
<p><strong>4.1 System Function</strong></p>
<p>The IDS must use passcodes for operations and programming features. All soft transactions must be recorded and time/date-stamped. The IDS must detect, log, and report unauthorized physical entry, duress alarms, and other events, such as system tampering.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Environment</strong></p>
<p>The IDS will be installed in individual offices, office suites, and other work areas. Controllers, monitors and printers will be installed in environmentally-conditioned spaces.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Hardware</strong></p>
<p>System hardware is expected to consist of a number of components including the controller, keypad, power supply, and ancillary equipment (such as a printer).</p>
<p>The controller, keypad, and power supply (and in some cases printer) are installed in the monitored (or "protected") spaces. Generic motion sensors, magnetic switches, etc., are required for an operational system, but these items are not included in this RFI.</p>
<p>The controller must be capable of recording, at a minimum, 5,000 time/date stamped events and must have the capability to sort and print these events.<br /> <br />The following salient characteristics are desired in the IDS:<br /><br /><strong>4.3.1 	Inside the Monitored/Protected Space:<br /></strong><br />a.	A software-controlled system controller of which the following is true:<br />i.	Includes programmable normally open/normally closed (NO/NC) relay outputs<br />ii.	Programming and data can be installed, updated, and backed-up/restored via either laptop computer or removable media<br />b.	Additionally, the system controller integrates the following sensors and features:<br />i.	Volumetric motion detection<br />ii.	Balanced magnetic contact switches<br />iii.	Mechanical switches<br />iv.	Signal line supervision<br />c.	The system controller must be capable of operating as an independently functioning system with the ability to activate other functions through the use of programmable relay contact closure outputs. At a minimum, these programmable outputs will indicate:<br />i.	Armed/Disarmed per partition<br />ii.	Alarm/Normal per partition<br />iii.	Tamper/Normal per system<br />d.	A user interface (keypad) that allows for:<br />i.	Arming/disarming of the system via personal identification number (PIN) of at least five digits, with a minimum of 200 user accounts<br />ii.	Display of alarm, trouble, and supervisory conditions <br />e.	Low voltage power distribution provided to control panels, sensors, keypads, and other ancillary system components.<br />f.	Ability to program the system into a minimum of four separate "partitions" from a single system controller (each partition will have a dedicated keypad).<br />g.	A "walk-test" mode to verify operation of all sensors and monitoring equipment.<br />h.	All events (e.g., systems status, sensor status, alarms) are logged in non-volatile memory by date and time for a minimum of 5000 events and remain viewable until manually deleted or overwritten due to event overflow.<br />i.	The controller must support an attached printer to record all system controller events (i.e. Arming/Disarming of each partition, alarm events, system programming changes, etc.).<br /><br /><strong>4.3.2	General System:</strong></p>
<p>a.	Can function as a "stand-alone" system.<br />b.	Should the system employ an encrypted data communication, this encryption should be a minimum of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). <br />c.	Accept a full range universal AC power (100-240 VAC &plusmn; 10%, 50 - 60 Hz &plusmn; 10%). <br />d.	Internal battery back-up power, capable of operating the system and attached peripherals independent of commercial power, for at least eight hours with an option of adding additional hours. <br />e.	Signal transmission must be completed by hard-wire; wireless is not an acceptable option. <br />f.	All enclosures and devices with removable covers must facilitate tamper protection. <br />g.	Use of lockable equipment cabinets, sized to accommodate the main system controller board and primary power supply. <br />h.	All system components (e.g., sensor zone input modules, relay output modules, keypads, etc.) must interface directly with conduit or have the ability to be mounted on/in an enclosure that can interface directly with conduit.<br />i.	A minimum mean time between failures (MTBF) of 10,000 hours.</p>

<a href="mailto:matthew.p.hancsarik@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Sacramento</a>
<DESC>Location <br> Folsom Dam is located at the confluence of the North and South Forks of the American <br> River, approximately 29 miles upstream from the city of Sacramento, near the town of Folsom, CA.  Sheet G-002 is a location, vicinity and site map of the Folsom Dam auxiliary spillway project.  The location of this bank stabilization work is on the right bank side of the American River about 1,000 feet downstream from the main dam (Sheet B-101). <br>  <br> Background <br> The convergence of flows from the main Folsom Dam and new auxiliary spillway could destabilize the existing slope where the flows converge.  After the auxiliary spillway becomes operational changes in river hydraulics downstream of the stilling basin will occur that have not been experienced to date.  Because of the orientation of the auxiliary spillway, an approximately 400 foot reach of the American River right bank area will become more vulnerable to erosion and scour. <br>  <br> Summary of Work <br> The primary objective of this project is to ensure the increment of the slope between about elevations 125 feet  and 160 feet  (NAVD 88) remains stable during future operations of the auxiliary spillway.  To achieve this, the lower bank slopes below about elevation 160 will be reinforced with 32' long, post tensioned, rock bolts based on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineer Manual (EM) 1110-1-2907.  Bolts will generally be installed on a 20-foot by 20-foot diamond pattern as shown on Sheet B-101; however, additional bolts may be installed at up to ten (10) locations at the direction of the Government.   <br>  <br> In addition to the installation of rock bolts as described above, it is anticipated that some dental concrete may be required to fill reentrant joint cavities to prevent the potential dislodging of several large rock blocks in the vicinity of Sta. 14+90 (see Sheet B-101).   <br>  <br> Site accessibility and the steep topography of the American River right bank site are a challenge to the planning, design and construction of the right bank stabilization effort.  The access ramp or temporary access route to the midslope work area will be steep with a grade as much as 30%.  Rock bolts will be installed on the lower vertical slopes and as such will require limited access drilling capability in order to install the bolts while suspended alongside the vertical slopes. <br>  <br> Desired Contractor Capabilities <br> USACE requests that interested contractors' demonstrate their capabilities to perform the Right Bank Stabilization effort as follows: <br>  	Access to  quote mark wagon quote mark  drills or other limited access drilling equipment <br>  	Ability to work suspended over water by ropes, climbing harnesses, or a platform <br>  	Ability to contain all drill cuttings and fluids while suspended over the river  <br>  	Ability to safely work with limited access and staging areas <br>  	Ability to work in close proximity of protected habitat and protected species <br>  	Limited construction duration (June 15 -  December 15; construction expected to be completed in 2015) <br>  <br> Information to be Submitted by Potential Contractors:  The Government is seeking sources with the above capabilities for the work outlined in the summary and provided drawings.  The Government will utilize the submitted information to determine the type of small business set aside for this acquisition.   <br>  <br> Thus, contractors interested in this project should submit a statement of capabilities, of no more than 10 pages, that: <br>  	States the contractors business size (small or large) and subcategory (i.e. 8A, HUBZone, Women Owned, etc.);  <br>  	Demonstrates the contractors experience and capability with similar types of work; and <br>  	Outlines the types of and access to equipment that will be used in performance of the work. <br>  <br> Information received in response to this Sources Sought will help determine the Government's acquisition planning including but not limited to Socio-Economic Set Asides (i.e. Small Business or Large Business), solicitation method (i.e. Sealed Bid or Best Value Tradeoff), and Evaluation Criteria should the solicitation become a Best Value Tradeoff. <br>  <br> Statements of Capability are due to the Government no later than 1630 PST on Monday December 22, 2014.   <br>  <br>  <br>

The VA Northern California Health Care System will be issuing an Invitation for Bids (IFB) to award a construction contract to a General Contractor for Project 612A4-14-006, High Efficiency Water Cooled Chiller. The project will be located at the VA Northern Health Care System on the Mather campus, CA.  The High Efficiency Water Cooled Chiller project consists of: 
Balance multiple building chilled water hydronic loops by replacing cooling coil control and balance valve with pressure-independent type control valves selected for design flow specific to each cooling coil. After building chilled water hydronic loops are balanced, replace 430 Ton chillers No. 1 and 2 with new 700 Ton high efficiency chillers, per drawings 612A4-14-006, by Hilliard Architects, dated 10/27/2014. Increase size of the primary chilled water and condenser water loop pumps and piping to accommodate larger 700 Ton chiller No. 1 and No. 2 flow rates. Increase size of secondary chilled water pumps and piping to accommodate future increase in chilled water demand.  
This project shall be done in two phases per drawings. Phase 0: Prior to removing chillers 1 and 2 from service, systematically replace every cooling coil control and balance valve with scheduled pressure-independent control valve. Integrate the dedicated surgery loop Air-Cooled chillers with the engineering control center. Install temporary constant primary loop from chiller No. 3 and temporary air -cooled chiller to building distributions with phasing valves.  This phase shall be completed end of April 2015.
Phase 1: Balance temporary constant primary loop from chiller No. 3 and temporary Air-Cooled chiller to building distribution loops and isolate from chillers No. 1 and 2 and secondary chilled water pumps.  Remove chiller No. 1 and 2 from service and replace with new 700 Ton high efficiency chillers, along with associated pumps, piping, and controls. This work must be done during the winter months between October 2015 and March 2016, or provide supplement temporary cooling.
It is anticipated an IFB will be released on/about January 15, 2015.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.0 GENERAL INFORMATION</span></strong></p>
<p>Title: Request for Information (RFI) for Next Generation Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) Training Waveform</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2.0 FEDERAL AGENCY NAME</strong></span></p>
<p>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></span></p>
<p>This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry before receipt of Proposals, Requests for Information". Respondents should note that no funding has been specifically reserved for this announcement. We are soliciting Requests for Information abstracts only. Do not submit a white paper or proposal at this time.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.1 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</span></strong></p>
<p>This announcement is not a request for proposals; therefore, responses to the RFI are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. NO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE RFI RESPONSE. Refer to Section 5 of this announcement for instructions on submitting an RFI abstract.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.2 SYNOPSIS</span></strong></p>
<p>Submission of an abstract is voluntary. Respondents are advised that AFRL is under no obligation to provide feedback with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.0 TECHNICAL BACKGROUND:</span></strong><br /><br />US Air Force organizations and officials have embraced Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) training as a viable method to adequately fulfill service readiness requirements. LVC training is a key element to reducing the time required to create combat readiness and operational proficiency, in a cost-effective manner. Real-time virtual and/or constructive entities will be injected into live aircraft to allow for the refinement and validation of the underlying scenarios to dramatically improve training effectiveness and efficiency, as well as overall mission readiness.<br /><br />Key to the success of the next generation LVC is the waveform choice. The waveform should be chosen based on how well it can meet future requirements of the LVC training community. It is imperative to come up with a long-term solution that fulfills the needs of the LVC communities for many years to come. This RFI seeks next generation LVC waveform capabilities.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.1 Introduction:</span></strong><br /><br />The Air Force needs to integrate live aircraft and virtual training assets through constructive elements that allow participants, whether live, virtual, or constructive to seamlessly engage with all training elements successfully. This capability will require bi-directional, secure communication between live and virtual players, as well as storing essential data during live missions that can be used during simultaneous debriefing of LVC sorties with the same level of fidelity. Among the information to be exchanged across data links is Time, Space and Position Information (TSPI). <br /><br />The current system that is used to exchange TSPI between training assets is called the Advance Range Data Systems (ARDS). The ARDS was originally fielded in the early 1990's with an expected lifespan of just eight to ten years. Almost twenty years past its designed usefulness, the need has arisen for a more up-to-date data link that can handle next generation requirements.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.2 Requirements:</span></strong><br /><br />Link security and encryption are critical. The requirement should include a provision that the waveform must be able to carry unclassified data as well as multiple levels of classified data. Therefore, it is desired that the next generation LVC waveform should have an MILS (Multiple Independent Layers of Security) feature to be able to move data up to TS/SCI level.<br /><br />The system as a whole should also be flexible to accommodate future upgrades while still fitting into form factor requirements. On fourth generation platforms, the system has a requirement to fit in the Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pod. On fifth generation platforms, the requirement must be able to fit in a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU).<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.3 LVC Waveform:<br /></span></strong><br />The respondent should provide enough technical description of the proposed waveform and how it will satisfy the requirements of the next generation LVC system. Respondents can propose either existing or to-be-designed waveforms.<br /><br />For each proposed waveform, the respondent should indicate its current Technology Readiness Level (TRL). For the to-be-designed waveforms, the respondent should provide the timeframe and rough cost estimate (non-binding) needed for the waveform to reach TRL-6 and its implementation on hardware.<br /><br />In addition, the respondent should provide technical details of how the proposed waveform is compared to existing solutions in terms of the next generation requirements. For example, a table may compare TRL level, MLS capability, form factor, use of open standards, common interfaces, low latency messaging, and node joining/rejoining/departure, and other relevant attributes across the proposed <br />waveform and existing waveforms. <br /><br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACRONYMS</strong></p>

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source - Per Department of Army (DA) Memorandum dated 19 Sep 2006, Subject: NETCOM Technical Authority (TA) Implementation Memorandum 2003-005c, Army Enterprise Desktop Standardization, Department of the Army is directing the implementation of a uniform desktop- computing environment for all organizations through the use of the consolidated buy contracts. This will cause a cost reduction for the Sierra Army Depot {SIAD) through the use of consolidated procurements of personal computer and server configurations. Dell standardization allows us to standardize on product lines and benefit from decreased hardware costs by providing consistent integration, installation and setup processes. We can maintain a single Operating System {OS) image for all hardware models, using multiple vendors would require maintaining multiple build images, or at least updating the build image to work with multiple models from multiple vendors. Having multi-platform certified technicians and parts inventory adds to the SIAD costs. If multiple platforms are used, it would be necessary to have vendor specific parts on hand for each of the approved vendors to facilitate quicker user repairs resulting in less time the user is non-functional. SIAD has been Dell server, desktops, and laptops specific since the direction for standardization sited above. Dell will also be able to supply the technical expertise to make our vSphere environment DIACAP compliantThe equipment and technical help to be purchased are Dell brand items as listed below. The purchases are to upgrade equipment and reconfigure software we currently use such as: Memory modules for Dell Servers, Dell Thin Client devices, Dell Precision workstations, Dell iDRAC6 Enterprise modules, and Technical Assistance to reconfigure Dell VMware environment.

<DESC>DARPA-SN-15-07 Sole Source Notice for KMel Robotics
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Contracts Management Office (CMO), on behalf of the Defense Sciences Office (DSO), intends to award a sole source contract to KMel Robotics (KMel) of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>This is a sole source synopsis for the acquisition of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) platforms in anticipation of a new DARPA/DSO program called Fast Lightweight Autonomy (FLA).  The program intends to develop novel representations and algorithms to enable small air platforms to fly fast (e.g., at least 20 m/s) in cluttered environments (e.g., indoors) using on-board autonomy with small size, weight, and power components.  To enable quantitative comparisons between different approaches to autonomy, the FLA program will require the use of identical platforms.  DARPA will provide a platform as GFE to FLA performers selected under an anticipated FLA broad agency announcement (BAA).</p>
<p>The source will be required to develop a platform with the following characteristics:  (1) a high-performance autopilot with bi-directional communication to custom closed-loop motor controllers, integrated low-level calibration software, and built-in sensor error detection and redundancy features; (2) an open interface that enables manual piloted control, autonomous control through an onboard computer or wireless communication module, vehicle configuration and tuning, and user customizable feedback of various sensor data from the autopilot; (3) modular design enabling rapid replacement of components after a crash; (4) modular design enabling the anticipated FLA performer teams to easily add their own processors, sensors, and other equipment to the platform; (5) employ electric propulsion using multiple rotors in order to hover; (6) produce 3,600 g of thrust in order to achieve high speeds; (7) exhibit a thrust to weight ratio above 3:1 with a 300 g battery in order to achieve high maneuvering agility; and (8) measure under 28 in. from end to end with propeller guards in order to fit with at least 8 in. of margin through 36 in. windows.  Further, the source will be required to deliver multiple copies of the platform, with documentation and an open application programmer interface, no later than May 1, 2015.  In addition, the source will be required to provide support to the anticipated FLA program performers using the platform; maintain the platforms; upgrade the platforms at least annually; and develop a baseline autonomous system to gain first-hand experience with the problem domain and apply that experience to platform improvements.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the only synopsis for this requirement and is issued for notification purposes only.  It is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements of this effort by submitting a white paper and past performance data no later than 4:00 p.m. (ET), December 24, 2014 to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Attn: Mr. Michael Mutty, Contracts Management Office (CMO), 675 N. Randolph Street, Arlington, VA 22203 or via email to michael.mutty@darpa.mil.  Questions shall be submitted to the above email address.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact KMel directly.</p>
<p>The Government will consider all information received before 4:00 p.m. (ET), December 24, 2014.  Information received will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Senior Aerospace Metal Bellows of Sharon, Massachusetts to provide the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (NOAA) Office of Atmospheric Research (OAR) a specialized stainless steel bellows compressor.</p>
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the NOAA's Office of Atmospheric Research requirement for a specialized stainless steel bellows compressor. This compressor will serve as a spare sampling pump for an existing air sampling-gas chromatography system for measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere. High quality measurements of VOCs are essential for NOAA's mission to study the radioactive forcing of climate and air quality - climate interactions. The compressor will be used onboard NOAA's WP-3D aircraft during the 2015 SONGNEX mission in the Western U.S. serving as a drop in replacement to allow continued operation during the field mission in case of failure of the main system compressor. Senior Aerospace Metal Bellows has offered to modify one of their existing aircraft bellows compressors specifically for NOAA. At this time, Senior Aerospace Metal Bellows is the only known vendor who is able to modify a bellows compressor in this manner.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The National Park Service, North Cascades National Park Service Complex, Sedro-Woolley, Washington, intends to award a sole source modification to TCC-NLC JV of Fife, Washington valued at $67,654 for additional within scope work related to the renovation of the Hoh Visitor Center near Forks, Washington.
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals and is announced for the purpose of compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, the justification follows:</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>1. Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity: Department of Interior, National Park Service, North Cascades National Park, 810 State Route 20, Sedro-Woolley, WA 98284.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: Modification of contract P14PC00411 for additional within scope work.</p>
<p>3. A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value: Modification, addresses safety concerns, improved access, improved visitor experience, improved energy efficiency, and unexpected contingencies occurring during contract performance. Proposed actions include pathway lighting, added roof insulation, drinking fountain in shelter, plumbing changes, extra floor preparation, remove root ball and hazard trees, remove phone booth, sewer lift station redesign and over excavation. Net increase $67,654(original award $1,145,293).</p>
<p>4. An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: NPS COTI 1443.06-02, DIAPR 2008-10, and FAR 6.302-1</p>
<p>5. A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: This was a competitive project that was properly synopsized and awarded. TCC-NLC JV was selected as the Best Value in accordance with the solicitation requirements and Federal Acquisition Regulations. The Contractor has performed quality work throughout the duration of the project and has completed construction per the construction documents (drawings and specifications). The contractor is presently actively mobilized and working at the Hoh Visitor Center which is located in a very remote part of Washington State and within a Rain Forest. Many of the identified changes will need to be performed during construction as it would not be possible or practical to stop work. The Government has requested and agreed upon a fair and reasonable price to perform the additional within scope requirements. It would be significantly more expensive to mobilize and demobilize new personnel and equipment needed to make the changes identified herein if this were part of a separate contract.</p>
<p>6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice Was or Will Be Publicized as Required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, If Not, Which Exception Under FAR 5.202 Applies: The Notice of Intent modification will be properly synopsized.</p>
<p>7. A Determination By the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable: Pricing for the additional work has been reviewed by the Program Manager and the Contracting Officer, documentation is on file.</p>
<p>8. A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market Research was conducted for the original contract. This added work is directly related to the original scope of work, it would not be practical to try and obtain a second contractor to do a small part of the additional work required.</p>
<p>9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (see FAR 6.302-2 (9) (i) - (iii) for some examples): N/A</p>
<p>10. A Listing of the Sources, If Any, That Expressed in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: N/A</p>
<p>11. A Statement of the Actions, If Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required: N/A, based upon the facts stated above.</p>
<p>12. Certification: I certify that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (i.e. verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate:</p>
<p>Required signatures pending final review and approval. Fully approved documents will be maintained on file at North Cascades Procurement Office.</p>
<p>Questions related to this notice shall be submitted in writing and directed to Barry Fetzer Contracting Officer, North Cascades National Park Service Complex, 810 State Route 20, Sedro-Woolley, WA 98284</p>

<DESC> <br> The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Constructive Simulations (PM ConSIM) is conducting market research to assist in developing an Acquisition Strategy (AS) for the Intelligence & Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT) contract to support the Product Manager (PdM) Warrior Training Integration (WTI) mission. <br>  <br> This effort is for continued analysis, design, development, integration, testing, security accreditation, installation, fielding, modifications, system support, and training support of the IEWTPT training capability - including associated simulation interfaces to complementary programs - and the Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Control Cell (HCC) configuration of IEWTPT.  The current Technical Control Cell (TCC) is a processor  quote mark server stack quote mark  that creates a realistic, relevant target environment for high-fidelity training on Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems supporting training in multiple intelligence disciplines such as: All Source, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), including Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronics Intelligence (ELINT); Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT);  Counterintelligence/Human Intelligence (CI/HUMINT); and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).   <br>  <br> The TCC has three (3) enclaves: the Lower Enclave (LE) (SECRET collateral), the Cross Domain Solution (CDS) (a.k.a. Data Diode), and the Upper Enclave (UE) (Top SECRET (TS)/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information (SCI).  In addition to realistic simulation data, it provides exercise control and support tools, authoring tools and scenario development capabilities, and AAR functions. The TCC has the capability to distribute the exercise simulations/ stimulation information to local/ closed networks and, in some instances, remote training locations via secure Joint/ Army networks.  The current HCC is an interactive, avatar based simulator created for HUMINT Soldiers and used by multiple Army disciplines to sustain tactical questioning skills.  The soldier can run through any number of multiple scenarios available, questioning virtual humans in a free flowing (non-scripted), realistic virtual environment in an attempt to extract mission-essential information.   <br>  <br> IEWTPT supports individual and/ or collective intelligence sustainment training by leveraging the Live, Virtual, Constructive - Gaming training environment capabilities and generating and/or augmenting and providing simulation-born data feeds to  quote mark real world quote mark  systems. IEWTPT is expected to transition to a cloud-based solution in the near future.  The planning and prototyping has begun for a cloud-based HCC capability. The IEWTPT system is fielded to multiple CONUS and OCONUS locations. <br>  <br> Additional information describing the IEWTPT programs can be found on the U.S. Army PEO STRI PM ConSim website, http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/IEWTPT/ <br>  <br> An Industry Day-Market Research Meeting is scheduled for 09:00.A.M - 5:00 P.M. on 9 January, 2015 to provide information about this requirement. <br>  <br> The meeting will be held in Partnership III (P3), Room 321 A/B, located at 3039 Technology Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826.  <br>  <br> To ensure adequate space is available, organizations are limited to three (3) representatives (3 representatives inclusive of prime and sub per team).

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to increase the ceiling of Contract N66001-11-C-4147 to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), awarded by SSC Pacific on behalf of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency Defense Sciences Office (DARPA/DSO) on 30 September 2011 for a performance period of four (4) years as a result of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 11-05 Pharmaceuticals On Demand (PoD).  The effort under the contract is to develop an automated desktop system capable of manufacturing small batches of several different pharmaceuticals daily using a shared set of starting materials.  The system combines every necessary step of manufacture including synthesis, separation, analysis and formulation into final dosage form.  The outcome of work performed under this modified contract will ultimately enable forward-deployed medical personnel to have immediate access to a wide variety of pharmaceuticals by producing needed medicines on demand in a form that is easier to carry in a pocket or medical field pack, a form that is preferable in a field environment.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541712.  Due to the nature of Research and Development efforts, DARPA could not have reasonably estimated the results of the research from this program, which has seen breakthroughs that will benefit from continued development to produce a solid dosage form under this current contract.  It is expected that the technology will transition for use by medical personnel in the field and will ultimately benefit the warfighter. This action includes a ceiling increase of approximately $860,000.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes and will be posted for 15 days.  A determination by the Government not to compete based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested parties may submit comments in writing to the Contract Specialist, Mrs. Lynn Biedermann, Code 22530, SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific who may be reached by telephone at (619) 553-4479 or via email to lynn.biedermann@navy.mil

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition
St Jude Heart Valve Consignment Agreement


1.	Contracting Activity:  The contracting activity responsible for this acquisition is Network Contracting Office (NCO) 19 on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 19, VA Salt Lake City Health Care System (VASLCHCS) located at 500 Foothill Drive, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84148 and the Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VAECHCS) located at 1055 Clermont St, Denver CO 80220.
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved:  This proposed contracting action is for a consignment agreement with St Jude for their Trifecta heart valves. The term for this acquisition is one base year plus four option years. The consignment source is St. Jude: 1 Lillehei Plaza, St Paul, MN 55117-9983.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:   St Jude will provide varying sizes of Trifecta heart valves for patients of the George E. Wahlen VA Salt Lake City Health Care System  and the Eastern Colorado Health Care System on a consignment basis. These heart valves will be used in aortic valve surgeries. The anticipated term of this consignment agreement will be for one base year and four option years beginning on or around January 1, 2015. It is estimated that the VA should have two of each size heart valve available to ensure optimal patient care. The cost for the duration of this agreement is estimated at $650,000.00 for five years. The medical center included a 3% increase in each years estimate.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
( )   (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
(X)  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5; see also 38 U.S.C. 8123
(  )   (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
(  )   (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;


5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  Surgically implanted products are specified by the clinical team to meet the unique and comprehensive needs of each Veteran with an identified medical indication. The specific product described above has been determined by the clinical team to be the best product to treat the Veteran patient's medical condition and functional limitations.  Substituting an implant with other than that specifically prescribed is beyond the role, competency and professional functions of the Contract Specialist and would be detrimental to the treatment of the Veteran patient. Full and open competition for the above described implant negates the clinician's subject matter expertise as related  to the medical treatment  for the individual Veteran as outlined in VAAR 806.302-5. In this case the by-name device(s) is/are the specific prescription and method of treatment for the Veteran-patient.  

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  This product is only available from one source. St Jude is the sole manufacturer and provider of these heart valves. St Jude does not authorize these products to be purchased by any vendors or small business distributors.
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:   The total value of the current requirement is $650,000.00.  The cost is determined to be fair and reasonable based on comparison with other heart valve products. Our anticipation is that when a consignment contract is achieved, use of products will limit costs to only those used and avoid expired product inventory. This is in contrast to maintaining a large inventory of variable sized products, which leads to product expiration and wasted capital. 
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:   Market research was performed on August 27, 2014 to explore other possible vendors that can provide the Trifecta heart valve products. The required products for this acquisition cannot be purchased through any other source. The detailed Market Research Report is included in the contract file.  
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:   Based on the medical judgment of the Chiefs of Surgery at the Salt Lake City VA Medical Center and Eastern Colorado Health Care System in Denver, Colorado, an alternative product would not meet all of the intraprocedural requirements to allow a safe and efficient use, nor do several competitive products have FDA approval.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section 6 above.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:   The Requesting Service will continue working with the RMAC in conducting Market Research for similar technology for the treatment of aortic diseases.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<CONTACT>Mr. Jim Quinn, MMESO South Clinical Analyst, Phone 210-292-3295, Email james.e.quinn28.ctr@mail.mil - Ms. Sarah Allen, MMESO South Clinical Analyst, Phone 210-292-3287, Email Sarah.L.Allen24.ctr@mail.mil
<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Hypothermia Prevention, Heating Blanket-Air Activated. Vendors who qualified for the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MS-1403-08_Hypothermia Prevention, Heating Blanket-Air Activated are eligible for participation. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Hypothermia Prevention, Heating Blanket-Air Activated products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the subject QSL. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<strong> Anticipated selection date is January 2015. Among vendors who are on the subject QSL, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Hypothermia Prevention, Heating Blanket-Air Activated.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Hypothermia Prevention, Heating Blanket-Air Activated. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $453,304.00 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the subject QSL who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO South via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification.<strong> Vendor pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.</strong></p>
<p>1. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.</p>
<p>Required Products / Annual Usage in Units<br />1. HYPOTHERMIA PREVENTION HEATING BLANKET-AIR ACTIVATED 4 PANEL, with an open size of 34" x 48" 12816<br />2. HYPOTHERMIA PREVENTION HEATING BLANKET-AIR ACTIVATED 6 PANEL, with an open size of 34" x 60" 3408</p>
<p>2. Vendor may provide any or all of the additional items listed below, following the same format as for requirement number 1. Pricing for these additional items will not be part of the pricing computation for vendor selection. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>OPTIONAL ITEM DESCRIPTION<br />1. HYPOTHERMIA PREVENTION HEATING BLANKET-AIR ACTIVATED 1 PANEL, with an open size of 16" x 18"<br />2. HYPOTHERMIA PREVENTION HEATING BLANKET-AIR ACTIVATED 12 PANEL, with an open size of 34" x 48"</p>
<p>3. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by the terms of the DAPA to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the SA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.</p>

<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a CCTV/PACS upgrade project at the Philadelphia P&amp;DC located at 7500 Lindbergh Blvd in Philadelphia, PA 19176. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost of the project is between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000 with construction completion within 365 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement and a Management Plan with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1) Contractors must be licensed, as required by the State of PA, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation.<br />(2) Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3) Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4) Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification.<br />(5) Company must submit information for a minimum of three and a maximum of five comparable projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as plumbing projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $300,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated: experience/performance and capabilities. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2, of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</p>
<p>Prequalified contractors will be placed on a list for inclusion in future solicitations in this area with similar scopes of work. There is no guarantee that a specific number of solicitations will be issued to these prequalified contractors.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE SITE ON DECEMBER 16, 2014, AT 10:00 A.M. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>The SOLICITATION PACKAGE is attached to this posting.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO Bob Ramba, Robert.c.ramba@usps.gov or Paige Lyne, Jacquelyn.p.lyne@usps.gov. Deadline for questions is noon on December 22, 2014.</p>
<p>There will be no public opening of offers. All proposal information received is CONFIDENTIAL until award of a contract. Upon award, the name of the successful offeror and the amount of the contract will be released as public information. The names of offerors and the amount of their offers will not be released as public information. This information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, Exception 4.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The procurement is conducted using Simplified Acquisition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 2305 and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) and 253a and 253b); FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items (Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355)), and FAR 37.104, Personal Services Contracts (Public Law 103-332, Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, Title II, September 30, 1994, 108 Stat. 2530 as implemented by 25 U.S.C. 1638c). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; therefore, a written solicitation will not be issued. The Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a fixed-price commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ)-10-15-012-REL. The solicitation is restricted to 100% Small Business concerns. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 561320 and the small business size standard is $27.5 million.<br /><br />PRICE SCHEDULE: MID-LEVEL PROVIDER (NURSE PRACTITIONER OR PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT: 1560 hours @ $_______________ per hour = $____________________.<br /><br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: January 1, 2015, through September 30, 2015.<br /><br />WORK SCHEDULE: 8 hour shifts, 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., every weekday, except holidays and weekends.<br /><br />BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The Mid-Level Provider Services are located at the Northern Cheyenne Service Unit, PHS Indian Health Center, 100 Cheyenne Avenue, Lame Deer, Montana. The Service Unit's access was recently cut below demand when a physician left to take a job in another State. The Service Unit has two female medical providers who do most of the women's health care but one of the providers also covers the Emergency Room. The Service Unit would like to contract with a provider who can work in the Outpatient Clinic so additional coverage can be provided to the female and prenatal patients. PURPOSE OF THE CONTRACT: The current goals at the Service Unit are to maximize the continuity of care provided to the patients in the Clinic. To achieve this, the Service Unit would like to provide better access to the patients by adding another provider in the Clinic until a permanent provider is hired full-time. The contract will help the Service Unit meet the needs of the patient population and increase the Women's Health coverage. STATEMENT OF WORK: Examines and diagnoses health related conditions of individuals presenting themselves for care; refers individuals for consultation when appropriate; prescribes and carries out therapy in conformance with approved clinical privileges and Billings Area/Indian Health Service policy. The mid-level provider educates individuals in the nature of health-related conditions, recommended therapy, and the general promotion of health and prevention of illness/diseases. Conducts initial and periodic health examinations for finding physical defects in need of correction, and prescribes and implements remedial treatments required to correct these defects. Orders immunizations to patients in compliance with established Indian Health Service and Billings Area policy. Makes necessary arrangements and authorizes admission of patients to the appropriate hospital. This includes authorization for admission to contract facilities for emergency medical care and surgery. Keeps the Service Unit Director or designee informed of Contract Health Service/Purchase Referred Care (CHS/PRC) admissions. Records patient-provider transactions in the problem oriented Electronic Health Record and completes required data collection instruments, referrals, and medical records as required. Refers patients and their families to Community Health Services personnel as appropriate for their continued care and follow up. Participates, as required, in Service Unit/Area meetings to develop new, modify existing, and evaluate medical procedures and processes relative to assurance of quality patient care. KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: The mid-level provider will see and provide medical care to all persons presenting to the clinic for medical care. The provider will possess a physician assistant degree or Advanced Practice Nursing license and be able to care for, in an appropriate manner, all patients who present to the clinic. These skills are outlined but not necessarily limited to the skills outlined in the clinic privileges packet. The provider will make an accurate, readable, and complete record of all patient encounters in the Electronic Health Record. SUPERVISION: The Supervisor defines the continuing assignment with procedures and methods to be used, priorities and deadlines. The Supervisor helps the provider with difficult or controversial aspects of the job requirement. The provider uses initiative in planning and carrying out the day-to-day workload. Final work is reviewed for conformance to policies and regulations, timeliness and satisfaction of the Supervisor. The Supervisor or his/her designee will assist the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) in monitoring the contract. The responsibility of the Supervisor is to supervise, monitor and ensure the provider is adequately performing the requested services, deliverables, duties and responsibilities in accordance with the work statement and performance standards. The Supervisor will monitor workload, completeness of charts, timeliness of the provider, and peer review of the provider's work output. Failure to maintain a positive working relationship with the Northern Cheyenne Service Unit staff and patients; maintain good readable records in a timely fashion; and work within the scope of standard medical practice for a physician assistant/nurse practitioner will result in termination of the contract. SUPERVISOR: Chief Medical Officer; ALTERNATE: Medical Officer. GUIDELINES: The guidelines the mid-level provider will follow are provided in the Medical Staff by-laws and the orientation book containing our standard operating procedures in the clinic for common situations that arise with patients in our unique situation. Otherwise, the provider will care for patients in a professional and competent manner of any licensed physician assistant or nurse practitioner. COMPLEXITY: The job will consist of managing a panel of assigned patients and working with a Primary Care Team to provide caring, consistent and standardized medical care. The job could possibly become very complex with the provider caring for patients with multiple chronic health problems and many difficult to manage prenatal patients. The job will require coordinating care for patients with in-house ancillary departments and between outlying facilities and also between Patient Referred Care Services and other third party billing companies for revenue reasons. SCOPE AND EFFECT: The mid-level provider will be fulfilling the mission of the Indian Health Service in providing medical care to the Native American population on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. PERSONAL CONTACTS: The mid-level provider will be working with an assigned Primary Care Team and other medical providers in the Clinic and in the Emergency Room for coordination of care. At times, the provider will be making contact with the BIA police, EMS staff, tribal social workers and Public Health Nurses. There will be interactions with lab and x-ray personnel, tribal behavioral health, general clinic staff, and administrative personnel as well as the janitorial and security staff, and just about anybody else who works in the building. PURPOSE OF CONTACTS: With the appropriate personnel, the mid-level provider will be sharing medical information about the patient so as to provide excellent medical care for the patient. Otherwise, the provider will be maintaining a positive working environment with the other staff. PHYSICAL DEMANDS: The mid-level provider will need to be able to care for several patients that will be presenting through an appointment system or Walk-In Clinic system. The provider must be able to do the physical skills as requested on the clinic privilege form, and to do these things without endangering the patient in any way. WORK ENVIRONMENT: The Service Unit will provide the mid-level provider with a neat and clean emergency room equipped to handle routine treatment of the patients who present. The Service Unit will also provide the necessary forms and medical records for the provider to document the visits. The Service Unit will provide computer use with Internet access to be used for work related searches. The nursing staff and x-ray and lab are provided during their routine work shifts. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: The IHS shall provide all necessary equipment and supplies. The Northern Cheyenne Service Unit will be responsible for getting the Contractor access and clearance to all computer services necessary to carry out his/her duties. COMPUTER SECURITY: Pursuant to the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), the contractor will be required to complete a course in Computer Security Awareness Training (CSAT). This training must be completed annually by all employees including all contractors, volunteers, students, and summer externs. The Contractor will be required to comply with the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, "Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors" and the associated Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implementation guidance for personal identity verification for all affected contractor and subcontractor personnel. Access/clearance to all pertinent computer systems, including completing the Security Checklist, Rules of Behavior form, Security training; and if necessary, a Business Partner Interconnection Security Agreement (BPISA), should be coordinated with the Service Unit. CONTRACTING OFFICER AUTHORITY: Authority to negotiate changes in the terms, conditions or amounts cited in this contract is reserved for the Contracting Officer. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S REPRESENTATIVE (COR): The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) shall be responsible for: (1) Monitoring the Contractor's technical progress, including surveillance and assessment of performance and recommending technical changes; (2) Interpreting the Statement of Work; (3) Technical evaluation as required; (4) Technical inspections and acceptance; and (5) Assisting the Contractor in the resolution of technical problems encountered during performance of this contract. INVOICE SUBMISSION AND PAYMENT: The Contractor shall submit its invoice to the Supervisor at the Northern Cheyenne Service Unit, PHS Indian Health Center, P.O. Box 70, Lame Deer, Montana 59043. The Contractor agrees to include the following information on each invoice: (1) Contractor's name and address; (2) Contact name, title, and telephone number; (3) Contract Number; (4) Invoice number and date; (5) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended price of supplies delivered or services performed; (6) Remit to Address; (7) Taxpayer Identification Number (Employer Identification Number or Social Security Number); and (8) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number (to ensure payment is made to the correct bank account) and vendor mailing address, as provided in the System for Award Management (SAM), formerly known as the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Payment shall be made by the Billings Area Financial Management Branch, P.O. Box 36600, Billings, Montana 59107. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer with evidence that payment of employment taxes has been made 15 days after each quarter. PRO-CHILDREN ACT OF 1994: The Contractor certifies that it will comply with the provisions of Public Law 103-227, Pro-Children Act of 1994, which imposes restrictions on smoking where federally funded children's services are provided. CHILD CARE NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK AND INVESTIGATION (CNACI). A CNACI must be completed for all Indian Health Service (IHS) contractor personnel within the Billings Area. Public Law (P.L.) 101-630, Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act and P.L. 101-647, Crime Control Act of 1990, require the IHS to conduct a character and criminal history background investigation on all contractors performing services in IHS facilities. The character and background investigations will be conducted by the Northern Cheyenne Service Unit. Fingerprints must also be taken as part of the pre-employment process and must be completed before the nurse is allowed to work. SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government. Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation, therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that the Contractor maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical and personnel records, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge. The Privacy Act carries both civil and criminal penalties for unlawful disclosure of records. Violation of such confidentiality shall be cause for adverse action. All IHS regulations and policies applicable to these Acts shall be enforced. The Contractor shall comply with IHS facility infection control and safety procedures, practices, and standards. Federal Tort Claims Act coverage for medical related claims is extended to the individual providing the services. However, the services must have been performed within the scope of the personal services contract. PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition. The FAR provision 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; and 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items are incorporated by reference. The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>

Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>In this study, the objective is to identify any salivary gland abnormalities that may predispose to Salivary Gland dysfunction in Sjogren's Syndrome patients, to explore if the striking female predominance of SS can be explained by intrinsic differences in salivary glands, to identify initiators of disease, and compare the gene expression profiles of healthy men and women as well as mouse models of the disease. This approach may identify abnormalities that are either intrinsic to the salivary gland (male to female and normal to SS comparison) or are important in the chronic inflammatory process (viral infection). These studies are covered under protocols 84-D-0056, 94-D-0018 and 99-D-0070.</p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Prepare and analyze cells and tissue from Sjogren's patients and controls</p>

<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Normalize signal from arrays and extract data on differentially expressed transcripts using multiple bioinformatics software packages.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Rank order differentially expressed transcripts based on statistical probability analysis, validate candidate differentially expressed transcripts by PCR, immuno, or hybridization techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Develop and test animal models to validate phenotypic effect of differentially expressed transcripts.</p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Develop models to test induction of differential expression of transcripts.</p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Isolate and characterize particles associated with viral transcripts.</p>
<p><strong>Task 8:</strong> The contractor maybe asked to attend specific conferences to present findings from this study.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC><p>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Southeast Sunbelt Region 4 announces the opportunity for a Design-Bid-Build Construction Contract for Renovation of VSR Resident Judge's Chambers in the Donald S. Russell Federal Building and Courthouse, 201 Magnolia Street, Spartanburg, South Carolina 29306.</p>
<p>The work includes the renovation of 3,040 square feet of office space for the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge's Chambers on the Third Floor of the Donald S. Russell Federal Building and Courthouse in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Renovations include the abatement of hazardous materials and a complete redesign of interior spaces and installation of new finishes. New millwork will be installed. The space will have a new sprinkler system extended into the tenant area. Mechanical and electrical systems will be renovated with new installation for this tenant. Sound attenuation is important in this project and design features shall be carefully followed to protect. The end product of construction must exhibit a very high level of finishes and workmanship. In general without force in the contract, the following items are included:</p>
<p>1. New wall, floor, and ceiling finishes<br />2. Some new plumbing fixtures<br />3. New lighting/power and data<br />4. Rework mechanical systems<br />5. New door systems<br />6. New toilet and break area<br />7. New custom millwork<br />8. Signage<br />9. Sprinkler renovation</p>
<p>The estimated price range is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The contract duration is 180 calendar days from the start date on the Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>The Small Business Size Standard for NAICS Code 236220 is $36,500,000.00 in average receipts over the past three (3) years.</p>
<p>Award will be based on the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Process.</p>
<p>GSA anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price contract to the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable contractor.</p>
<p>The Government would rank proposals based on price, and then evaluate the lowest-priced proposal for technical acceptability. If the lowest-priced proposal was determined to be unacceptable, the new lowest-priced proposal would be evaluated. This would continue until an award is made to the lowest-priced propoasl found technically acceptable. <br /><br />FAR 15.101-2 describes the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection process as follows:<br />(a) The lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. <br />(b) When using the lowest price technically acceptable process, the following apply: <br />(1) The evaluation factors and significant subfactors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth in the solicitation. Solicitations shall specify that award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. If the contracting officer documents the file pursuant to 15.304(c)(3)(iii), past performance need not be an evaluation factor in lowest price technically acceptable source selections. If the contracting officer elects to consider past performance as an evaluation factor, it shall be evaluated in accordance with 15.305. However, the comparative assessment in 15.305(a)(2)(i) does not apply. If the contracting officer determines that a small business' past performance is not acceptable, the matter shall be referred to the Small Business Administration for a Certificate of Competency determination, in accordance with the procedures contained in Subpart 19.6 and 15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)). <br />(2) Tradeoffs are not permitted. <br />(3) Proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors. <br />(4) Exchanges may occur (see 15.306).</p>
<p>A selection will be made off of the following solicitation factors:</p>

The drilling unit must be a tracked drilling rig and all supplies necessary to drill approximately 12-15 holes.  The results from the holes will be used for stability analysis. The borings will average 30 feet in depth, but may be as deep as 90 feet.   A Government inspector, on site, will determine the final field location and depth of each boring.   The borings will be taken on a mixture of private property and Government owned land.  A minimum of 90 feet of at least 3 1/4-inch I.D. hollow stem auger will be required, and bentonite mud with rotary drilling may be necessary to advance the boring below the water table.  <br> Water levels are important for stability analysis, and may be somewhat slow to obtain in the soils anticipated.	Short auger borings (approx. 20-25 feet), offset from the pilot holes, and allowed to stand open overnight may be necessary to obtain water levels.  The Government inspector will make that determination in the field.     <br> All holes will be sampled continuously, unless directed otherwise by the Government  <br> Inspector.  Standard penetration equipment (SPT) will be used in combination with a 2-  inch  <br> O.D. by 3-foot long split spoon sampler. Auger cuttings for Proctor analysis may also be collected.  An automatic hammer will be required for standard penetration testing.   5-inch diameter undisturbed samples (Shelby-type and/or piston-type) will be required.  The government inspector will make that determination in the field.  Soils expected to be encountered include interbedded alluvial sands, silts, and clays as well as glacial clays and tills.  <br> Jar samples will be taken by a Government inspector every 5 feet or change in material.  The Government representative will take care of all samples; prepare the boring log, coordinate rights-of-entries, and utility checks. <br> The boring crew should be prepared to tremie cement-bentonite grout to backfill borings and instrumentation clusters. <br> The work will be performed between 05 January and 06 February, 2015  <br> Upon award of this delivery order, field coordination POC is Kevin Nelson at  <br> (651)  290-5844 or Terry Jorgenson at 651-290-5598.  <br>  <br>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

    (i) Relevant Past Performance shall be evaluated.  
    (ii) Price.  Price will be evaluated using one or more of the price analysis techniques in FAR 13.106-3.
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
As part of price evaluation, the government will evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR clause 52.217-8) by adding one-half of the offeror?s final option period price to the offeror?s total price.  Thus, the offeror?s total price for the purpose of evaluation will include the base period, 1st option, 2nd option, 3rd option, 4th option, and one-half of the 4th option.  Offerors are not required to enter a price for the six month period.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities.

The drilling unit must be a tracked drilling rig and all supplies necessary to drill approximately 12-15 holes. The results from the holes will be used for stability analysis. The borings will average 30 feet in depth, but may be as deep as 90 feet. A Government inspector, on site, will determine the final field location and depth of each boring. The borings will be taken on a mixture of private property and Government owned land. A minimum of 90 feet of at least 3 1/4-inch I.D. hollow stem auger will be required, and bentonite mud with rotary drilling may be necessary to advance the boring below the water table. <br />Water levels are important for stability analysis, and may be somewhat slow to obtain in the soils anticipated. Short auger borings (approx. 20-25 feet), offset from the pilot holes, and allowed to stand open overnight may be necessary to obtain water levels. The Government inspector will make that determination in the field. <br />All holes will be sampled continuously, unless directed otherwise by the Government <br />Inspector. Standard penetration equipment (SPT) will be used in combination with a 2- inch <br />O.D. by 3-foot long split spoon sampler. Auger cuttings for Proctor analysis may also be collected. An automatic hammer will be required for standard penetration testing. 5-inch diameter undisturbed samples (Shelby-type and/or piston-type) will be required. The government inspector will make that determination in the field. Soils expected to be encountered include interbedded alluvial sands, silts, and clays as well as glacial clays and tills. <br />Jar samples will be taken by a Government inspector every 5 feet or change in material. The Government representative will take care of all samples; prepare the boring log, coordinate rights-of-entries, and utility checks. <br />The boring crew should be prepared to tremie cement-bentonite grout to backfill borings and instrumentation clusters. <br />The work will be performed between 05 January and 06 February, 2015 <br />Upon award of this delivery order, field coordination POC is Kevin Nelson at <br />(651) 290-5844 or Terry Jorgenson at 651-290-5598. <br /><br />

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<SUBJECT>Philippines - Security Vulnerability Assessments for Airports

<NTYPE>COMBINE  
<RESPDATE>010715
<CONTACT>Jennifer Van Renterghem, USTDA - 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600 Arlington, VA 22209, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email RFPQuestions@ustda.gov
<DESC>USTDA has received inquiries as to whether the RFP is open to consulting firms.  In response, per RFP section 2.11, only U.S. firms are eligible to participate in the tenders.  As stated in RFP section 2.19, Offerors shall submit evidence that they have relevant past experience and have previously delivered advisory, feasibility study, technical assistance and/or other services similar to those required in the TOR, as applicable.
<p><br />USTDA has received inquiries pertaining to Section O: Export Licensing of Annex II (USTDA Mandatory Contract Clauses):</p>
<p>1)	Some security technologies require export licenses, and some may not be permitted to be exported. Are potential Offerors to include such a determination in Tasks 3,4 &amp; 5 ?  <br />2)	An early deliverable in the project is the "training workshop" which includes best practices for airport security vulnerability assessments. Will selection of these practices also be subject to the requirements of this section?</p>
<p>In response, Section O of Annex II (USTDA Mandatory Contract Clauses) pertains only to the U.S. Contractor and all subcontractors related to the performance and delivery of the technical assistance.  Section O does not apply to the potential solution that would be implemented after the technical assistance is completed.  So, during the implementation of the project, if the potential solution includes technology that requires a license, then it is up to the ultimate provider of that technology to obtain the license.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries regarding the level of sophistication of the analysis for Task 8 in the Terms of Reference to be performed and whether it will be based only on statistics provided by CAAP or also involve additional research.  The answer is the analysis for this task need be sophisticated enough to assist the Grantee in determining if current revenues collected from passenger facility charges are sufficient to fund the required and recommended improvements, or if fees will need to be raised to generate the necessary funds for security investments.  It is anticipated that the benchmark analysis would require additional research.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries regarding whether the preliminary environmental impact analysis in Task 10 of the Terms of Reference will include a review of full life cycle issues or just deployment in the Philippines.  In response, the preliminary environmental impact analysis would focus on the potential environmental impacts associated with the implementation of the recommended investments in the Philippines.</p>
<p>USTDA has received inquiries regarding whether U.S. publicly traded firms are able to participate.  The answer is yes, eligible and interested U.S. publicly or privately held firms, or other U.S.-incorporated entities such as a non-profit, may participate.</p>
<p>USTDA is making this information available for the benefit of all prospective bidders. The response date for this RFP remains 4:00 PM local (Manila) time on January 7, 2015.</p>

<p>Sources Sought Synopsis</p>
<p>F-16 Program Office<br />Fighter/Bomber Directorate<br />Air Force Life Cycle Management Center<br />Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</p>
<p>1. Description</p>
<p>1.1 The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Fighter/Bomber Directorate (WW), F-16 Program Contracting Office (WWMK), Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking information on a sustainment upgrade or replacement for the current United States Air Force (USAF) F-16 Blocks 40/42/50/52 Programmable Display Generator (PDG).</p>
<p>1.2 Specifically, the F-16 program office is requesting information on a PDG sustainment upgrade or replacement that can be retrofitted onto the existing USAF F-16 Blocks 40/42/50/52 aircraft without exceeding the current Size Weight and Power Cooling (SWaPC) capabilities. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this potential work is 334511: Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, size standard 750 employees.</p>
<p>2. This Is A Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) Only</p>
<p>2.1 This SSS is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This SSS does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.</p>
<p>2.2 The Air Force is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this SSS. All costs associated with responding to this SSS will be solely at the interested parties' expense.</p>
<p>2.3 Responders shall describe how they meet the requirements listed under the Requirements Description and must fully answer the Contractor Capability Survey portions - Part 1 and Part 2.</p>
<p>2.4 Contractors must be either U.S.-owned or a U.S.-owned subsidiary with valid security infrastructure and clearances to accomplish this effort. Large businesses are encouraged to indicate the extent to which they intend to use small businesses.</p>
<p>2.5 The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>3. If there is sufficient demonstrated interested and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a response as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>4. Note that, if this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentages.</p>
<p>5. If a company is capable of some, but not all of the consolidated requirements stated in this SSS, please provide a response that explains the requirements for which you are capable.</p>
<p>6. Not responding to this SSS does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website. It is the responsibility of the potential respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>7. Background</p>
<p>7.1 The PDG provides the ability to drive the displays on the F-16. The Government is investigating the possibility of initiating a USAF F-16 PDG sustainment upgrade or replacement program. The objective would be to develop, produce, and field an upgraded PDG system to address operational requirements and supportability issues, with development beginning in 2015 and production beginning in 2019.</p>
<p>7.2 F-16 combat capabilities have expanded to reach the video processing limits of the current PDG. This PDG upgrade supports future Operational Flight Program (OFP) software sustainment upgrades and will support displaying critical operational information. The current PDG cannot handle the volume of operational information in dynamic mission environments. As a result, it is unable to drive modern cockpit displays or support high definition video; due to memory, throughput, and interface limitations, displays routinely blank critical operational information during high track/data density mission scenarios. Critical components of the PDG are suffering Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, including memory components. Upgraded PDG is required to address the digital display/video processing limitations and support modern high definition displays with sufficient memory and throughput to provide properly functioning displays through the entire dynamic envelope of the aircraft to support future operational capabilities.</p>
<p>7.3 Due to security access, system attributes, and concept of operations, foreign contractor participation is not permitted at the prime contractor level. United States contractors must develop the PDG in the United States of America.</p>
<p>7.4 The planned production is estimated to be 700 PDGs, including spares and trainers.</p>
<p>8. Security requirements will be in accordance with the F-16 Security Classification Guide (SCG) and any other applicable classification guides. Please contact F-16 Program Office if you require a copy of the SCG.</p>
<p>9. Industry Discussions: AFLCMC/WWM representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential respondents. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements.</p>
<p>10. On the following pages is a description of the PDG upgrade requirements and a Contractor Capability Survey which allows you to provide your company's capability.<br />11. If, after reviewing this information, you desire to respond to the SSS, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability to meet these requirements. Companies may be contacted for further information or clarification; however, failure to provide documentation may result in the U.S. Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how your company would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.). Documentation should be provided in the form of a white paper.</p>
<p>12. Questions related to this market survey should be addressed to the Program Manager, John Weyrick, at 937-713-6515 or the Contracting Officer, Christopher Hampton, at 937-713-6996. Questions regarding classified communications shall be addressed by the Security Officer, Ms. Rachel Garcia at (unclassified) 937-904-7735, for directions to a classified phone line.</p>
<p>13. Please include two complete hard copies of the response, no longer than 25 pages each, along with one softcopy on compact disk-read only. In addition, please send one copy by e-mail no later than close of business 30 calendar days after posting date, to the Contracting Officer, Christopher Hampton, at christophe.hampton@us.af.mil, and to the Contracts Negotiator, Christopher Rittenhouse, at christopher.rittenhouse@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC> <br>  This SSA is being issued to obtain information from interested sources regarding their ability to satisfy the requirements for the retrofit of 19 AN/TPQ-53 IP Radar Systems, program management support, and the system and production acceptance testing (SAT and PAT) of each retrofitted system.  <br>    <br>  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSA, or to otherwise pay for the information requested.  This SSA shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, or request for proposal.  It shall not be used as the basis for a proposal.  <br>    <br>  The Government anticipates retrofit will be accomplished under a firm fixed price (FFP) delivery order (DO) issued under the Global Tactical Advanced Communications System (GTACS) contract W15P7T-13-D-0010.  The draft PWS is attached to this announcement.  The AN/TPQ-53 Performance Specification (77A582901) is available upon request.   <br>    <br>  Program Overview:  <br>    <br>  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System will serve as the Army's replacement for the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Radar Systems.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System shall satisfy known, current, and future force concept requirements by interfacing with the global information grid and future force battle command systems.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System provides the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counter-battery target acquisition for all types and phases of military operations.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System is a highly mobile radar that will detect projectiles in-flight, as well as determine and communicate the firing point location of rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM).  It will be deployable and capable of operation in varying terrain and climatic conditions.  The system shall provide both 90 and 360 degree azimuth detection coverage against all threats at increased ranges, enhanced human machine interface, ease of programmability, and built-in capacity for growth.  It also will accurately locate and classify hostile weapon locations at greater ranges and coverage patterns to permit more effective detection and counter-battery fires.     <br>    <br>  Current and future forces have a critical and immediate need for a RAM locating system that provides 360 degree detection coverage to mitigate capability gaps in force protection and target detection.  Current indirect fire detection systems lack the mobility and agility to meet the requirements of the supported force and are too large and slow to support units in all types of military operations.  Brigade combat teams and field artillery brigades must quickly secure the operational area and the current counter fire systems introduce unnecessary risk to operations.   <br>    <br>  Request for Information:  <br>    <br>  In providing your response to this announcement, please ensure you address all of the following questions as well as provide any additional data/information you feel necessary for the Government to assess your capabilities in support of the retrofit.  <br>    <br>  1)  Company name, cage code, point of contact and point of contact email address.  <br>    <br>  2)   State whether your firm is interested in participating as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor on the AN/TPQ-53 radar contract.  Companies that intend to be a prime contractor should clearly demonstrate that they possess the technology, design and production capabilities to meet the specified requirements.  Any small business interested in participating as the prime contractor should clearly articulate their plan to satisfy the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.   <br>    <br> 3)  State whether your company is considered a Large or Small Business in relation to North American Industry Classification System Code 334511-Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing.  Small businesses must identify any applicable socio-economic categories such as small disadvantaged business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, 8(a), woman owned small business, etc.   <br>    <br> 4)  Identify potential partner/teaming arrangements or joint ventures that may be pursued to meet AN/TPQ-53 IP Radar retrofit requirements.   <br>    <br> 5)  Summarize relevant experience with radar technologies.  Identify any systems in development, systems planned for development, or fielded systems that may be used or leveraged to satisfy the requirements of the AN/TPQ-53 Performance Specification (77A582901).    <br>    <br> 6)  Describe production and manufacturing capacity.  Identify the length of time after contract award that production representative IP retrofit systems will be available for acceptance testing.  Identify the minimum, maximum and optimal monthly production rate for the proposed system.  Identify the lead time required to achieve each of these production rates.   <br>    <br> 7)  Clearly identify assumptions on which your response is predicated.  As a minimum, identify any required GFE/GFI on which the approach is predicated, and all required Government support anticipated.   <br>    <br> 8)  Provide a milestone schedule for accomplishing the system retrofits. The period of performance in 36 months.  <br>    <br> 9)  Identify major cost drivers for this action.   <br>    <br> 10)  Provide any other relevant information you wish to share regarding your ability to satisfy the AN/TPQ-53 IP requirements.   <br>    <br> Submittal:  <br>    <br> Company information will be verified via the System for Award Management (SAM) data base. Responses to this RFI/SSA must be unclassified, and must not exceed 12 pages in length (includes cover page, and table of contents) with fonts no smaller than 11 point, and one inch margins.  Each page of the submission shall contain the document identifier in the document header.  Information is to be received in one continuous Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint or .pdf document.

<DESC>Amendment 1, Include in special notice NAICS code 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)<br /><br />The US Forest Service (FS), Superior National Forest, intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order, as authorized by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 (13.106-1 (b) (1)), to Western Ecosystems Technology, Inc., 415 W 17th St STE 200, Cheyenne WY 82001-4303.<br /><br />The Chippewa National Forest has been collecting bat acoustic transect data using full spectrum recorders since 2011. The Superior National Forest has been collecting bat acoustic transect data using zero-crossing recorders since 2009. The Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest has been collecting bat acoustic transect data since 2009. The principal objectives of the proposed analyses will be to: 1) characterize the summer bat community within each Forest, 2) determine summer distribution patterns of sensitive bat species like the northern long-eared bat (proposed federally endangered) within the Chippewa National Forest, the Superior National Forest and the Chequamegon-Nicolett National Forest, and 3) to provide a direct comparison of various acoustic identification techniques including both quantitative (automated programs) and qualitative (manual examination by experienced personnel) analysis methods. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data to be Analyzed<br /></span>&nbsp; &bull; The Chippewa National Forest has been collecting acoustic transect data (driving routes) since 2011 using the Binary Acoustics AR-125. Call files are full spectrum in .wav format. There has been no screening of files to filter out noise files or other non-bat recordings.<br />&nbsp; &bull; The Superior National Forest has been collecting acoustic transect data (driving routes) since 2009 using the Anabat SD-1 and SD-2 acoustic detectors. Call files are zero-crossing and in typical Anabat format. There has been screening of files to filter out noise and other non-bat recordings.<br />&nbsp; &bull; The Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest has been collecting acoustic transect data (driving routes) since 2009 using the Anabat SD-1 and SD-2 acoustic detectors. Call files are zero-crossing and in typical Anabat format. There has been screening of files to filter out noise and other non-bat recordings.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acoustic Analysis<br /></span>Full spectrum bat echolocation calls will be identified using the four quantitative identification methods currently under evaluation by USDI Fish and Wildlife Service: Bat Call Identification Program (BCID, www.batcallid.com), EchoClass (Eric Britzke, ERCD), Kaleidoscope Pro (www.wildlifeacoustics.com), and SonoBat (www.sonobat.com) (See http://www.fws.gov/midwest/Endangered/mammals/inba/<br />surveys/inbaAcousticSoftware.html. BCID and EchoClass will only identify zero-crossing (ZC) data so full spectrum call files are required to be converted to ZC data files using Kaleidoscope Pro. The resulting ZC data files will then be run through BCID and EchoClass for identification.<br /><br />Zero crossing calls will be identified using three of the quantitative identification methods: Bat Call Identification Program (BCID, www.batcallid.com), EchoClass (Eric Britzke, ERCD), and Kaleidoscope Pro (www.wildlifeacoustics.com)<br />&nbsp;<br />Qualitative call analyses will be conducted on all bat calls. Qualitative call analysis will be conducted by an experienced biologist with expertise in acoustic identification of bats in the eastern United States.<br /><br />All bat call files will be examined and identified to species, species group (e.g. big brown/silver-haired bat) or as unknown.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Findings Report</span><br />A findings report will be required for each Forest upon completion of the analysis. Each report will present data on the number of bat calls recorded and identified and compare the species identification results of each program. Project deliverables include the report, all acoustic identification program output files, summary spreadsheets, and labeled echolocation call files.<br /><br />This requirement is not expected to exceed $25,000. However, companies that feel they can provide equal services may submit a statement of capability, past performance information, price and delivery time for satisfying this requirement no later than 2 pm, Central Time, on 18 Dec 2014. The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is: 518210. The expected period of performance is approximately 6 months after issuance of a contract. Point of contact for this requirement is Paul Nephew, pnephew@fs.fed.us or (218)-626-4360.

<DESC>Title of Project: JEFF-199869 CITYARCHRIVER 2015 RENOVATE ARCH VISITOR CENTER
<p>GENERAL:<br />The National Park Service (NPS), Department of Interior (DOI), Denver Service Center (DSC), is soliciting proposals on a full and open basis from all interested businesses having the capability to perform the work described below. The solicitation will be issued electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov. The Proposal documents will be available for download in Microsoft Word, HTML, Microsoft Excel, and Adobe PDF; Specifications will be available in Adobe PDF format; and drawings will be available in PDF format. (A single file format is not possible due to the types of files) Plan holders will be required to visit the website periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents. No other notifications will be sent. Please Note: Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available. Prospective offerors desiring to conduct business with the DOI are requested to be registered in the Systems for Awards Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov. It is important to note, award cannot be made to a prospective until that firm is registered in SAM.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this requirement is 236220.</p>
<p>This proposed project is the fifth phase of the larger City Arch River (CAR) program that will upgrade and enhance the visitor experience at the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial in St. Louis, Missouri. The Renovate Arch Visitor Center project is one of 7 projects planned for the Park.</p>
<p>This proposed project includes a new accessible west entrance and 45,183 square foot, multi-level addition to the existing 103,546 square foot subterranean Museum of Westward Expansion and Visitor Center.</p>
<p>The proposed project includes a museum addition consisting of a concrete, glass, and stainless steel structure creating the new main entrance and upper level lobby. The new main entrance will be located to the west side of the existing underground museum, facing the Old Courthouse and the new Park over Highway to the west. The new upper level Lobby includes security screening, information, ticketing, a public gathering area, restrooms and circulation areas. From the new Lobby, visitors will descend via elevators or stairs to mezzanine level or the lower, main level of the Museum/Visitor Center. The mezzanine level includes space for educational activities and special events and will introduce visitors to themes presented in the new exhibits. On the lower level, below the mezzanine, is the education area that includes a multi-purpose room, a distance learning facility, resource and administrative staff areas. Also on the lower level, at the base of the stairways and escalators, is the new exhibit gallery that will connect to the larger new exhibit gallery area in the renovated existing building. New mechanical, electrical, plumbing, IT, security, and communication systems will be connected to support areas in the existing building. There will be a new waterproofing system over and around the new addition.</p>
<p>The proposed contract will see work in the existing underground building, to remove and reconfigure the museum gallery and administrative office areas. A new exhibit gallery area will be constructed with new infrastructure and finishes. Administrative and work areas for Park and Staff will be reconfigured around the perimeter of the new exhibit gallery areas. A new office area for Metro, operators of the Arch Tram, will be constructed in the current location of the Museum Store. The Museum Store will move to the space formerly occupied by the Odyssey Theater and a limited Food Service Concession will be located in the current area of the Levee Mercantile store. The new Museum Store and Food Concession areas will be completed to a "white-box" level finish. The existing Public Bathrooms will be upgraded with new fixtures, accessories, and finishes. New finishes, ramps, and other accessibility improvements will be made to the exits leading to the Arch legs. The existing Visitor Center Lobby space will improved with new finishes, lighting and acoustical treatments. The Lobby's terrazzo floor will be removed and replaced. New mechanical, electrical, plumbing, IT, security, and communication systems will be installed throughout the existing building. The existing subterranean waterproofing system over the roof structure and upper walls will be removed and replaced.</p>
<p>The entire site in this proposed project's contract area, including the areas directly above the new entrance addition and the existing museum, will require re-grading, new landscaping, a new irrigation system, and installation of amended soil and sod. The entire project has been designed and will be constructed to achieve Silver LEED certification. The project site is part of a National Historic Landmark and is subject to related requirements including, but not limited to, archaeological monitoring, protection of and documentation of existing historic elements. The anticipated construction period is between Spring of 2015 and Spring 2017, with no mandated seasonal shutdowns. The Contractor shall coordinate with the Park and adjacent work site contractors to not impede Park operations and public visitation of the Arch tram, Museum Store, Tucker Theater, and Levee Mercantile. The facility will remain open to the public and critical utility systems may not be interrupted. Effort must be taken to limit any conflict between other adjacent construction activities, Park visitors, and Park operations.</p>
<p>Staging areas and site access are extremely limited. The site is located in an urban area surrounded by roadways and interstate highways. Visitor access to the existing Arch must be maintained throughout construction. The project site is part of a National Historic Landmark and is subject to related requirements including, but not limited to, archaeological monitoring, seismic monitoring, protection of and documentation of existing historic elements. The North and South Park Grounds, North Gateway, Luther Ely Smith Square, and Ranger Station work will be underway simultaneously to the construction. Coordination with other General Contractors will be necessary to connect utilities between the contract areas and to coordinate installation of structures and materials along the limits of work lines between contract areas.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the project is approximately $85,500,000 to $100,500,000 including all labor, materials, equipment and expertise necessary to perform all operations required for the successful completion of the above named project.</p>
<p>Type of Procurement: It is anticipated that a negotiated, firm-fixed price contract will be awarded resulting from a full and open competition, requiring submission of both a technical and price proposal. The government will consider an Offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which, if submitted in a timely manner, will be considered. It is the policy of the government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All Offerors are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration Office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors at http://www.sba.gov. <br />Responses from Bidders will be accepted at the address listed in the solicitation in hard copy with the manual signature of the authorized company official. Facsimile offers shall NOT be accepted. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation. This announcement does NOT constitute the solicitation</p>

<DESC>***TIME FOR PROVIDING COMMENTS EXTENDED TO JANUARY 9, 2015***

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic is seeking input for a possible industry forum in 2015. With current budget considerations, we are unable to host an on-site, conference-type industry forum in 2015, but we are considering returning to an on-line webinar industry forum, similar to the format we used in 2012. NAVFAC workload data for construction, environmental, planning, design, and IDIQ contracts is being updated now on the NAVFAC public website and will be current for FY15 prior to 31 December 2014.

Our point-of-contact is Mr. Thomas E. Barstow, Deputy Operations Officer, tom.barstow@navy.mil. Please respond to Mr.
 Barstow with answers to the following questions:
- Is a webinar industry forum of value to you? 
- Would you participate, or not, in a webinar industry forum?
- If interested in a webinar industry forum, what is the desired length of the webinar and what topics should be included?
- In which quarter of our fiscal year (1 October - 30 September) would you prefer an industry forum?

We would appreciate receiving comments on or before January 9, 2015.

<DESC>TB-29X Synopsis on issuance of RFP N00024-15-R-6263
<p>The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a Full and Open Competitive solicitation for the development of a First Article Unit and production of up to sixty-eight (68) TB-29X Thin Line Towed Array Assemblies (TAAs) under a performance specification. This requirement includes Array Receiver Units, Test Sets, Shipping Reels, Engineering Services and Provisional Item Orders. The resultant contract will include one (1) base year and four (4) option years. The RFP is expected to include a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) First Article in the base period with production units being procured on a Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF) basis for option year 1 and a Fixed-Price-Incentive (FPI) basis in option years 2-4. Engineering and Technical Services will be procured on a CPFF basis with support on a cost-only basis. TB-29X is the future generation planned reliability improvement to the TB-29A. TB-29X will be a 416 channel Thin Line Towed Array (TLTA) with an equivalent acoustic performance capability to TB-29A. This RFP and related files listed under solicitation number N00024-15-R-6263 will be issued electronically. The RFP is expected to be issued by February 2015. Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it directly to their workstation on or after the date of issuance by accessing the following address via the internet site or URL: https://www.fbo.gov.&nbsp; Companies are encouraged to request performance specifications and data prior to issuance of the RFP. However, this information will not be mailed to offerors until the RFP is issued. The performance specification and other related controlled files will be mailed only to those companies with a validated security clearance. To attain this clearance, prospective offerors must submit a written request to the PCO Representative, LCDR Tara Moore, at tara.l.moore@navy.mil. The written request must include the company name, cage code, and complete destination address and security point of contact. Once a prospective offeror's "need-to-know and security clearance" is verified and approved, the company will be authorized to receive the performance specification and other related controlled files. DFARS 252.204-7004 Alternate A, Central Contractor Registration, applies. Lack of current registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Information may be obtained via the internet at www.ccr.gov. Once the RFP is issued, the Government will consider all comments received. The Government does not commit to providing a response to any comments or questions. The subsequent revision to any specification or RFP based on comments received remains solely at the Government's discretion. Access to the unclassified information involved in this RFP does not imply that foreign contractors can fully participate in this procurement. Should a foreign company choose to bid as a prime contractor, please notify the Contract Specialist identified below immediately. No further information can be released to a foreign entity until a favorable foreign disclosure decision is processed. If a foreign offeror decides to team with a U.S. prime contractor then the U.S. prime contractor must comply with the Department of State 22CFR Parts 120-130 and submit a request for an export license. No comments, questions, or inquiries shall be made to any Government person other than the point of contact identified below. This is not an RFP. This notice shall not be construed as a promise to contract or commitment of any kind. This information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract. The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred by industry in responding to this notice.

<DESC> <br>  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Constructive Simulations (PM ConSIM) is conducting market research to assist in developing an Acquisition Strategy (AS) for the Intelligence & Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT) contract to support the Product Manager (PdM) Warrior Training Integration (WTI) mission.  <br>    <br>  This effort is for continued analysis, design, development, integration, testing, security accreditation, installation, fielding, modifications, system support, and training support of the IEWTPT training capability - including associated simulation interfaces to complementary programs - and the Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Control Cell (HCC) configuration of IEWTPT.  The current Technical Control Cell (TCC) is a processor  quote mark server stack quote mark  that creates a realistic, relevant target environment for high-fidelity training on Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems supporting training in multiple intelligence disciplines such as: All Source, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), including Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronics Intelligence (ELINT); Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT);  Counterintelligence/Human Intelligence (CI/HUMINT); and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).    <br>    <br>  The TCC has three (3) enclaves: the Lower Enclave (LE) (SECRET collateral), the Cross Domain Solution (CDS) (a.k.a. Data Diode), and the Upper Enclave (UE) (Top SECRET (TS)/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information (SCI).  In addition to realistic simulation data, it provides exercise control and support tools, authoring tools and scenario development capabilities, and AAR functions. The TCC has the capability to distribute the exercise simulations/ stimulation information to local/ closed networks and, in some instances, remote training locations via secure Joint/ Army networks.  The current HCC is an interactive, avatar based simulator created for HUMINT Soldiers and used by multiple Army disciplines to sustain tactical questioning skills.  The soldier can run through any number of multiple scenarios available, questioning virtual humans in a free flowing (non-scripted), realistic virtual environment in an attempt to extract mission-essential information.    <br>    <br>  IEWTPT supports individual and/ or collective intelligence sustainment training by leveraging the Live, Virtual, Constructive - Gaming training environment capabilities and generating and/or augmenting and providing simulation-born data feeds to  quote mark real world quote mark  systems. IEWTPT is expected to transition to a cloud-based solution in the near future.  The planning and prototyping has begun for a cloud-based HCC capability. The IEWTPT system is fielded to multiple CONUS and OCONUS locations.  <br>    <br>  Additional information describing the IEWTPT programs can be found on the U.S. Army PEO STRI PM ConSim website, http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/IEWTPT/  <br>    <br>  An Industry Day-Market Research Meeting is scheduled for 09:00.A.M - 5:00 P.M. on 9 January, 2015 to provide information about this requirement.  <br>    <br>  The meeting will be held in Partnership III (P3), Room 321 A/B, located at 3039 Technology Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826.   <br>    <br>  To ensure adequate space is available, organizations are limited to three (3) representatives (3 representatives inclusive of prime and sub per team). Organizations wishing to participate shall pre-register by providing the names and contact information (e-mail and telephone number) of their representatives and one alternate via email to the Technical POC no later than 02:00 PM, 05 January 2015. Foreign Nationals may not attend this event.    <br>    <br>  Attendees will also have the opportunity to participate in  30-minute one-on-one sessions following the government's presentation.  When pre-registering, please indicate your firm's desire to participate in a one-on-one session. Based on the number of interested parties, your firm's point of contact will be notified of your scheduled 30-minute one-on-one discussion with members of the Government project team. The one-on-one sessions will be held in PIII, Room 321 A/B from 1300 - 1700 on 09 January  2015.  <br>    <br>  All questions will be captured during the sessions and answers to all questions will be posted to FedBizOps for the general public.  <br>    <br>  NOTE:  <br>    <br>  DISCLAIMER:  The information provided in this notice is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject services.

<DESC>THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source contract to Charter Environmental Inc.  This sole source contract is required for completion of construction activities to implement the approved Final Remedial Action Work Plan (RAWP) developed for the Nyanza Superfund Site OU4-Reach 3, Framingham, MA. The work plan was developed under the scope of work defined in task order 0002 under contract W912WJ-11-D-0009, issued to Charter Environmental Inc.  The intent of the Government was to issue a follow-on task order under contract W912WJ-11-D-0009 to implement the approved Final Remedial Action Work Plan (RAWP).  Prior to issuance of the intended task order, as a result of administrative inadvertence, an option to extend the IDIQ contract was not timely exercised.  This intended follow-on task order was within the scope, within the maximum value of the IDIQ contract, and within the potential period of performance of the IDIQ contract had the option been exercised timely.  In the interest of transparency, in an abundance of caution, and to prevent any continued actual or apparent irregularities, the Government is pursuing the action identified herein to correct an administrative mistake.    <br> All responsible sources may submit a response, which, if timely received, will be  considered by the agency.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice of intent.  <br> All responses received within 10 days of the posting of this notice, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  <br> Submit any responses within 10 days of the posting of the notice of intent via email: Raushanah.M.Muhammad@usace.army.mil (list W912WJ-11-D-0009 in the subject line of the email) or mail to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: Contracts Branch R. Muhammad, 696 Virginia Rd, Concord, MA 01749. <br>  <br>

<DESC>Location  <br>  Folsom Dam is located at the confluence of the North and South Forks of the American  <br>  River, approximately 29 miles upstream from the city of Sacramento, near the town of Folsom, CA.  Sheet G-002 is a location, vicinity and site map of the Folsom Dam auxiliary spillway project.  The location of this bank stabilization work is on the right bank side of the American River about 1,000 feet downstream from the main dam (Sheet B-101).  <br>    <br>  Background  <br>  The convergence of flows from the main Folsom Dam and new auxiliary spillway could destabilize the existing slope where the flows converge.  After the auxiliary spillway becomes operational changes in river hydraulics downstream of the stilling basin will occur that have not been experienced to date.  Because of the orientation of the auxiliary spillway, an approximately 400 foot reach of the American River right bank area will become more vulnerable to erosion and scour.  <br>    <br>  Summary of Work  <br>  The primary objective of this project is to ensure the increment of the slope between about elevations 125 feet  and 160 feet  (NAVD 88) remains stable during future operations of the auxiliary spillway.  To achieve this, the lower bank slopes below about elevation 160 will be reinforced with 32' long, post tensioned, rock bolts based on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineer Manual (EM) 1110-1-2907.  Bolts will generally be installed on a 20-foot by 20-foot diamond pattern as shown on Sheet B-101; however, additional bolts may be installed at up to ten (10) locations at the direction of the Government.    <br>    <br>  In addition to the installation of rock bolts as described above, it is anticipated that some dental concrete may be required to fill reentrant joint cavities to prevent the potential dislodging of several large rock blocks in the vicinity of Sta. 14+90 (see Sheet B-101).    <br>    <br>  Site accessibility and the steep topography of the American River right bank site are a challenge to the planning, design and construction of the right bank stabilization effort.  The access ramp or temporary access route to the midslope work area will be steep with a grade as much as 30%.  Rock bolts will be installed on the lower vertical slopes and as such will require limited access drilling capability in order to install the bolts while suspended alongside the vertical slopes.  <br>    <br>  Desired Contractor Capabilities  <br>  USACE requests that interested contractors' demonstrate their capabilities to perform the Right Bank Stabilization effort as follows:  <br>   	Access to  quote mark wagon quote mark  drills or other limited access drilling equipment  <br>   	Ability to work suspended over water by ropes, climbing harnesses, or a platform  <br>   	Ability to contain all drill cuttings and fluids while suspended over the river   <br>   	Ability to safely work with limited access and staging areas  <br>   	Ability to work in close proximity of protected habitat and protected species  <br>   	Limited construction duration (June 15 -  December 15; construction expected to be completed in 2015)  <br>    <br>  Information to be Submitted by Potential Contractors:  The Government is seeking sources with the above capabilities for the work outlined in the summary and provided drawings.  The Government will utilize the submitted information to determine the type of small business set aside for this acquisition.    <br>    <br>  Thus, contractors interested in this project should submit a statement of capabilities, of no more than 10 pages, that:  <br>   	States the contractors business size (small or large) and subcategory (i.e. 8A, HUBZone, Women Owned, etc.);   <br>   	Demonstrates the contractors experience and capability with similar types of work; and  <br>   	Outlines the types of and access to equipment that will be used in performance of the work.  <br>    <br>  Information received in response to this Sources Sought will help determine the Government's acquisition planning including but not limited to Socio-Economic Set Asides (i.e. Small Business or Large Business), solicitation method (i.e. Sealed Bid or Best Value Tradeoff), and Evaluation Criteria should the solicitation become a Best Value Tradeoff.  <br>    <br>  Statements of Capability are due to the Government no later than 1630 PST on Monday December 22, 2014.    <br>    <br> Statements of Capability should be email to Mr. Matthew Hancsarik at matthew.p.hancsarik@usace.army.mil by the deadline presented above.

<DESC>For this requirement, an RFI was issued with a summary of the objectives being sought. As a result, two (2) capability statements were received. Analysis of the RFI responses indicates that small businesses are available to fulfill the objectives of the SOW; therefore, this requirement will be a total small business set aside. The Regional Contracting Office's Small Business Representative concurs with the small business set-aside.

<DESC>This requirement provides support services and associated supplies to the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) for general building maintenance, cable riser service, preventative maintenance, and associated utility costs.
<p>In order to fulfill this requirement of the US Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Procurement Operations intends to enter into a contract with S.C. Herman &amp; Associates, Inc. on a sole source basis pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 3304(d)(1) and pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide services within 24 hours of notification to the DNDO for minor repairs, installation of peripheral equipment, general building maintenance, building engineer services, and other services not included in the General Services Administration (GSA) lease agreement. The preventative maintenance services will also include preventative maintenance for the portion of the building automated control system (BACS) that supports the supplemental air conditioning units. The contractor shall provide additional utilities services to the area occupied by DHS DNDO. These utilities are to support supplemental air conditioning units that were requested by DHS DNDO. These units and the utilities required to support them are responsible for providing supplemental air to conference rooms, LAN rooms and SCIF (Secured Compartmented Information Facility) areas.</p>
<p>The Occupancy Agreement (OA) between the DNDO and SC Herman covers some building services. However, as stated in the occupancy agreement, any services that are not covered must be provided through GSA Public Building Service (PBS) or the lessor on a reimbursable basis. Since the agreement states services may only be provided by GSA PBS or the lessor, DNDO is not free to solicit and/or procure building services under full and open competition. Even if the services were procured through an Interagency Agreement (IAA) to GSA PBS, their (GSA) lease agreement states that GSA still has to go to SC Herman for the services. Based on the Economy Act, the Contracting Officer has to make a determination and findings that the services cannot be obtained as conveniently or economically by contracting directly with a private source, hence this determination cannot be made. There is no convenience of using an IAA instead of a BPA since both instruments require similar administrative processing efforts. With respect to economics, GSA would obtain the same pricing from SC Herman as DNDO would if DNDO sought the services directly from SC Herman. Additionally, DNDO would have to pay GSA an administrative handling fee to obtain services on behalf of DNDO.</p>
<p>Determination by the Government whether to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. The anticipated period of performance will be August 4, 2014, through August 3, 2018. Place of performance shall be at DHS offices located in the greater Washington DC metropolitan area.</p>
