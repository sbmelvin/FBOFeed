<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. PROPOSALS OR RESPONSES ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED OR ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME.
<p><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Transatlantic Afghanistan District (TAA) intends to solicit for a multiple award task order contract (MATOC) to fulfill construction projects in the various provinces of Afghanistan. Competition will be limited to sources from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Task orders under the MATOC will typically contain a 35% design including floor plans and will require the contractor to complete the design analysis, plans and specifications for all design submittal stages required by the task orders. Design submittal content shall include field testing, laboratory testing, design analysis, plans and specifications for: geotechnical report; existing topographic survey; architectural, structural, civil, mechanical, plumbing, electrical, etc. Plans and specifications shall be in accordance with current U.S. design, Unified Facilities Guides Specification (UFGS) and International Building Codes (IBC), Life Safety Code (NFPA-101), and force protection and security standards. Work will vary from site to site and will require extensive knowledge in design elements of both vertical and horizontal construction.<br /><br />Task orders may include design and construction projects for the following types of work:</p>
<p>1. Force Protection (perimeter walls, perimeter lighting, entry control points, guard towers, guard shacks, personal bunkers, barriers)</p>
<p>2. Base Housing (barracks, dining facilities, latrines, laundry facilities)</p>
<p>3. Base Support (administration building, classrooms, hangars, storage buildings, vehicle maintenance facilities, fuel storage &amp; vehicle refueling points)</p>
<p>4. Miscellaneous Buildings (day care centers, medical clinics, fitness centers)</p>
<p>5. Utilities (electrical power generator and/or distribution, water supply/storage distribution, wastewater collection &amp; treatment systems, wellhouse, water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer systems)</p>
<p>6. Grounds (trash collection points, parade ground review stand, sports field &amp; bleachers)</p>
<p>7. Miscellaneous Support (roads, parking areas and motor pools)</p>
<p>Construction will be in accordance with current building codes, safety and security standards, and local standards. Task orders shall include but not be limited to the necessary design program, site development and improvements, facilities, management, planning, material, labor and equipment unique to and/or associated with each project.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the MATOC will be $49.5M for a three year base ordering period. The estimated magnitude of task orders is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The government's intent is to issue a solicitation using a design-build, two-phase, best value tradeoff source selection procedure where up to five (5) contracts will be awarded. The government reserves the right to award more or less than five or none at all. Phase I will consists of non-pricing evaluation criteria where selection of 5 to 8 of the most highly qualified offerors will be selected to Phase II. In Phase II, offerors will be asked to submit non-pricing (to include a design) and pricing information for evaluation. All resultant task orders will be issued on a firm-fixed price basis using either a tradeoff or a lowest priced technically acceptable source selection procedure.</p>
<p>The tentative date for issuance of the RFP is mid-December 2015.</p>
<p>All interested offerors MUST be a source from Afghanistan and must have active registrations in the following databases at the time of proposal submission:</p>
<p>__System for Award Management (SAM): http://www.sam.gov/</p>
<p>__Joint Contingency Contracting System (JCCS): https://www.jccs.gov/</p>
<p>__Afghan Investment Support Agency (AISA) License: http://www.aisa.org.af/</p>
<p>Failure to have an active and/or completed registration in any one of the above databases at the time of proposal submission may determine an offeror's proposal as non-responsive and removed from competition. Information contained within an offeror's registration must be current and valid. The responsibility of maintaining current information contained in an offeror's registration rests solely on the offeror. If an offeror is a joint venture (JV), the JV entity must have a valid registration representing the JV as one business/firm/entity. This is applicable to SAM, JCCS, and AISA. The government will not accept separate registrations and licenses for each separate entity representing the JV.</p>
<p>Questions regarding the presolicitation notice may be addressed via email to Mr. Ralph La Rosa at Ralph.J.LaRosa@usace.army.mil and Ms. Thuy Le at Phuong-Thuy.T.Le@usace.army.mil. Only email responses will be reviewed.</p>
<p>The government is not requesting information from the public at this time. Information regarding this notice will be updated and posted to FBO as necessary. Interested parties are encouraged to check FBO before sending email inquiries. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.</p>

<DESC><strong>1. General</strong> <br /><br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT Notice and is for informational/market research purposes only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS OR BIDS, NOR A SYNOPSIS OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION UNDER FAR SUBPART 5.2. <br /><strong><br />2. Contract Information</strong><br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Northwestern Division, Portland District (CENWP) has been tasked to solicit a contract for The Lamprey Passage Structure: John Day and Bonneville Dams, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The proposed project will be a competitive, firm-fixed price (FFP) contract. Responses to this Sources Sought announcement will be used by the Government to make, if appropriate, a small business set-aside acquisition strategy decision.
<p>The purpose of this project is to improve upstream migration efficiency for Pacific lamprey through Bonneville Dam. The project consists of three primary tasks, outlined below. All work will take place at the Washington Shore fish ladder.</p>
<p>A. There is an existing lamprey passage structure in and over the fish way near the upstream exit of the fish way. The structure consists of aluminum ramps, boxes, and flumes as well as pumps and electrical components. The contractor will construct two new aluminum collector ramps, new rest boxes, a platform and stairway, and a flume to connect to the existing LPS in the MUWS Channel. The contractor will also install a new water supply system (with two pumps) for the new LPS The start of the system, from the collector ramps to rest box 3 will be made from fabricated aluminum, while the long traversing flume (~140ft) will consist of 10-inch irrigation pipe that the contractor will modify with access hatches. The platform and stairway to access rest boxes 1 and 2 will be made of steel. The overall flume system will be approximately 200 feet long. The contractor will also replace exiting electrical components, provide new pumps and pump controls, and other minor improvements. Any activities in or over the fish way must occur during the period 1 Dec 2016 to 28 Feb 2017.</p>
<p>B. There is an existing lamprey flume system (LFS) that is attached to the downstream entrance of the fish ladder and is suspended over the tailrace. The contractor will install an air manifold on the water supply box hatches of the "Upper Flume" to vent entrained air and will also install "separator plates" and "porosity plates" within the "Upper Flume". Also at the LFS, the contractor will replace the lower inspection port on the "Upper Flume" and install a platform and stairs to access the first rest box located on the south wall of the WA Shore fish ladder (just D/S of the North Upstream Entrance). All items will be fabricated from steel. Work on the LFS will occur over the water within the boat restricted zone (BRZ), and needs to occur during periods of low tail water elevation (October to November 2016) in order to access lower portions of the flume. USACE will coordinate with fisheries agencies for this early in water work (IWW) since it is outside of the normal Dec -Feb IWW window dates.</p>
<p>C. The contract will also include fabrication and installation of minor modifications within the fishway. In the serpentine section of the ladder, up to eleven (approx. 1.5" x 16") orifices will be cut into the base of the serpentine weirs. Six to twelve lamprey refuge boxes will be mounted to the floor of the fishway to provide a place for lamprey to rest and take refuge during the day. Guides will be installed in up to six location to facilitate video monitoring. The purpose of the video monitoring is to confirm previous studies of how the orifices and refuge boxes affect passage. Diffuser plating will be installed in the lower ladder/transition pool, some of which has already been fabricated and is onsite. Metal components will be fabricated from stainless steel and coated with epoxy to the underside and all surfaces where new stainless steel diffuser plates and associated fasteners come into direct contact with existing metals.<br /><strong><br />3.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Economic Research Service (ERS), intends to award a sole-source contract to GAMS Development Corporation to provide GAMS licenses annual updates. General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is the only available software that offers a variety of linear and non-linear solvers and can be used for partial and general equilibrium, stochastic and deterministic models at the national, regional, and sectoral level. This software is used in PEATSIM (ERSWTO) and the Regional China models and allows the evaluation and performance simulations using various policy instruments, such as loan rates, target prices tariffs quotas of a variety of crops and livestock activities for the WTO negotiations. <br />This vendor's software is the only one used for REAP (U.S.M.P.) model for regional and environmental simulations and Trade Liberalization of Agriculture. The model estimates interregional, interindustry transaction flows based on an interregional shipments using GAMS on a large UNIX system. This is a unique system/framework that combines economic and geographical information system (GIS) data. However, the model solution calls for state-of-the -art formulation and solution algorithms that are available only in GAMS. <br />This vendor's software is the only one used for the FARM model. FARM model is an integrated modeling framework designed to analyze global changes related to long-run agricultural and environmental resources. By generating stress on natural resources, global increases in human populations and economic activities may threaten long-run agricultural and environmental sustainability. Evaluations of how economic growth may be maintained without sacrificing environmental amenities in the 21st century are hampered, however, by the lack of appropriate modeling tools.<br />No other software is available in the market that can perform regional economic analyses on WTO negotiations, China's policies on world commodity markets, global FARM model, food stamps and poverty.<br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. This notice is for informational purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Vendors that believe they can provide the services listed above are invited to submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to the notice. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based on responses to the notice is solely at the discretion of the Government.
