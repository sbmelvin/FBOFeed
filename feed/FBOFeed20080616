<CONTACT>Michael Q Cramer, Contracting Officer, Phone (937) 255-5830, Email michael.cramer@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><p>This is an open-ended Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit proposals for the "Metamaterial Materials Development for RF and Optical Applications" Program which will be managed and executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials &amp; Manufacturing Directorate, Non-Metallic Materials Division (AFRL/RXB), Wright Research Site. This BAA is anticipated to remain "open" for three (3) years.
<p>The overall objective of this program is to provide the Government with a procurement vehicle for executing the above named program. A metamaterial for the purpose of this BAA is defined as an artificial material with an engineered permittivity, permeability, and loss. Metamaterials can be grouped into the following categories: (a) double positive, where the permittivity and permeability are simultaneously positive and close in value to each other over a discreet bandwidth (b) Zero index, where the permittivity and permeability are simultaneously zero over a discrete bandwidth (c) double negative, where the permittivity and permeability are simultaneously negative over a discrete bandwidth. These metamaterials are potentially useful for RF antennas, filters, circulators, and frequency selective surfaces; as well as optical / IR beam steering, compact optical systems, mirrors, optical circuitry, interconnects, filters and limiter applications. The objective is to demonstrate transitionable metamaterial technologies for RF and Optical/IR applications. The scope of this BAA will cover the modeling, synthesis, processing, device fabrication/prototyping, production and testing of materials which fall into the categories above.</p>
<p>Multiple contract awards are anticipated via release of this BAA Nr. 08-14-PKM announcement. This announcement describes the overall program. Calls to the BAA/solicitation will be issued to request specific efforts in one or more of the technical areas: BAA Calls will contain descriptions of the efforts to be addressed, anticipated period of performance, and the expected dollar range for proposals. Once a BAA Call is issued on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website, offerors will have a limited number of days to submit proposals (White Papers first if using the two step procedures). Proposals received outside of the set forth period (i.e. a BAA Call already issued and the proposal due date has passed, or a BAA Call has not yet been issued) will not be reviewed and will be returned to the offeror. NOTE: Proposal receipt after the due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). Multiple BAA Calls are anticipated and may be announced sequentially or concurrently. The Government also reserves the right to make no award against any subsequent BAA Call.</p>

<DESC>Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) is a net-centric Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) weapon system (WS), capable of tasking ISR sensors and receiving, processing, exploiting, and disseminating data/information from airborne, national, and commercial reconnaissance platforms and sensors such as the U-2, Global Hawk, and Predator. AF DCGS performs global multi-INT operations and correlates collected Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT). This WS consists of numerous active duty, Air National Guard, and mission-partner sites interconnected by the Global Information Grid (GIG). AF DCGS Block 20 (Increment 2) is the next major acquisition activity building upon the architectural framework established by AF DCGS Block 10.2. Block 20 (Increment 2) will modernize Signals Intelligence capabilities, integrating it into AF DCGS net-centric environment as well as provid! e new and enhanced capabilities and continuing IMINT and MASINT updates. AF DCGS WS capabilities will be expanded to handle an increased number of existing, upgraded, and new sensors with improved communications and processing/ exploitation timelines. Current planning is for these capabilities to be developed and fielded through several versions, with each version providing a capability that is affordable, militarily useful, and based on a mature technology. Delivery of Increment capabilities will be primarily based on user priorities and the availability of mature technologies. Please check back on HERBB for future updates and more information when it becomes available.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for microsatellite deployers with systems engineeringdesign and development support.  Each microsatellite deployer shall carry up to 3 smallCubeSat microsatellites or one 3U microsatellite spacecraft.  A standard CubeSat is a 10cm. (4 inch) cube with a mass of up to 1 kg. (2.2 pounds).  CubeSats are flight certifiedand have been used on various NASA missions, including GeneSat.  The present NASA MissionOffice requirement specifies a 3U deployer that can launch either 3 single (1U each)cubes sequentially or an integrated 3U spacecraft from a single 3U deployer.  All presentNASA launch vehicles are configured for the 3U deployer.NASA/ARC intends to purchase purchase these items from Cal Poly Corporation, a 501(c)(3),non-profit corporation that supports California Polytechnic State University at San LuisObispo, CA), in accordance with 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the only known responsible source forthese items, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  ARequest for Information (RFI #NNA08242834L-AMD) was posted on the NAIS/ Fed Biz Oppswebsites on May 15, 2008.  Numerous submittals from industry and academia provided inputsand suggestions on NASAs proposed technical and procurement approach to thisrequirement.  As a result of this information and ongoing market research, it has beendetermined that only Cal Poly can satisfy the current NASA requirement. Cal Poly is the original developer of the Poly Picosatellite Orbital Deployer (PPOD). The Cal Poly PPOD has a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 9, successfully launching on anumber of academic, commercial, and US military and NASA flights.  The PPOD was developedto support the CubeSat standard, but can be easily enhanced to accommodate spacecraft andmission requirements, while still maintaining flight certification.These launch vehicles and adapters will form the basis of NASAs near term spaceflightmissions for the next 12 months.  No additional qualification or certification will berequired of the Cal Poly deployer outside of the routine pre-launch test and verificationactivities normally associated with flight projects.Cal Poly is registered with the US Dept of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls(DDTC) to comply with all government regulations including the ITAR in 22 CFR 120-130. This is important as the launch program may include instances in which some NASAspacecraft may be aboard a commercial launch vehicle along with a spacecraft or payloadfrom a foreign country.  The proposed procurement will require the following deliverables:1.  Engineering Design and Development of Engineering Development Unit (EDU) triple cubecapacity PPODs, quantity 2, required delivery NLT 10/31/08. 2.  Engineering Design and Development of Flight-ready, triple cube capacity PPODs,quantity 2, required delivery NLT 12/31/08; quantity 2, required NLT 4/1/09. The solicitation and contract will include the clauses FAR 52.217-7 Option for IncreasedQuantity- Separately Priced Line Item, and FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of theContract.  If exercised, Cal Poly will deliver a partial or total quantity of thefollowing:3.  An option to provide up to 2 additional Engineering Design and Development ofEngineering Development Unit (EDU) triple cube capacity PPODs.4.  An option to provide up to 8 additional Engineering Design and Development ofFlight-ready, triple cube capacity PPODs. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV, intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to The Pennsylvania State University, Department of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering, 337 Leonhard Building, University Park, PA 16801. The purpose of this contract is to develop a prototype project. It's ultimate goal is to facilitate a line of research to help reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders caused in the workplace. The Department of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University, is uniquely qualified to accomplish this prototype development because of their long-standing, demonstrated expertise in both engineering mechanics and 6DOF biomechanics of human movement. Colleagues at this university, in Biomechanics and in Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, enhance the ability to complete the project successfully. The combination of colleagues in such close proximity is also unique. There are portable, kinematic sensor systems available (inertial and optical-fiber based), but these are integral with full-body suits that would not be practical for field investigations due to heat and interference effects. Access to raw data is limited with these off-the-shelf suits, greatly compromising the ability to extract data needed for custome applications. These systems do not provide the required kinetics. Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward capabilities and supporting information to: Kimberly Groves, Reference: 000HCCCE-2008-57674, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, or E-mail kpg0@cdc.gov or fax to 304-285-6083.
<p>The government will review any/all capabilities statements and and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract. Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Pennsylvania State University, Department of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>SUBJECT:  GLOVEBOXE WITH SINGLE FILTER COLUMN GAS PURIFICATIONSYSTEM.This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions, assupplemented with additional information included in this notice.   QUOTESAREBEING REQUESTED.  Responses shall reference Request for Quotations No.DE-RQ26-08NT00682 the U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy TechnologyLaboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA  intends to purchase the followingGloveboxe (1 EACH) with the following specifications:SINGLE FILTER COLUMN GAS PURIFICATION SYSTEM,ANTECHAMBER RIGHT SIDE, 115V, INCLUDING ALL STAINLESSSTEEL GAS FLOW PIPING,EDWARDS RV12 VACUUM PUMP,INTERNAL POWER STRIP,50CFM VARIABLE SPEED BLOWER, AND SPAREKF40 FEEDTHROUGHS.PROGRAMMABLE AUTOMATIC ANTECHAMBER CONTROLLER WITH LEAK CHECK ABILITY6" MINI ANTECHAMBER MOUNTED RIGHT SIDE WITH SLIDING TRAY, AN-02 SOLID STATEO2ANALYZER,INTEGRATED SOLID STATE H2O ANALYZER,INTEGRATED FREEZER, -35 DEGREES MOUNTED LEFT SIDE,115V,INTERNAL CHARCOAL TRAP,AUTOMATIC PURGE VALVE,INTERNAL GLOVE PORT COVER,3/8 STAINLESS STEEL BULKHEAD, FEEDTHROUGH INCLUDING 3/8"STAINLESS STEEL INTERNAL TUBINGAND 3/8" STAINLESS STEEL 2-WAY HAND VALVEBINDING POST FEEDTHROUGHKF40 4BNC FEEDTHRUFINE FILTER8B1532 L/R 8.5 BUTYL GLOVES (U/M 1 150.00 150.00PAIR)ACTIVATED CARBON (U/M: KG)MANN FILTER FOR CARBON FILTER 50.00 100.00ELEMENTIn addition the following specs must also be met:Blower- The blower is vibration isolated and will not disrupt the readingson abalance.  The blower is also variable speed so that you can lower the CFMfrom50 cfm to 1 cfm allowing you to circulate through the purifier while usingabalance so that the turbulence of a normal blower 40 cfm will not give youafalse measurement.The purifier valves are automatic and have a micro switch to activate theblower only when they are opened.Back up e-prom and memory.  If the power is going to be going out thelithiumbattery holds the memory of what functions are on before the power goes outandturns those functions on again when the power resumes.  i.e. thecirculationblower.The PLC is on a swivel arm and can be read by the user of the glove boxwhilein the gloves.  This is absolutely necessary since when we are opening theantechamber we can observe any increase in H20 that may destroy thereactionswithin the glovebox.The PLC also has function buttons right on the controller.  This means wecanturn on and off circulation with the touch of one button when a spike ofroomair enters the glovebox.Waterproof foot pedals are necessary in case of a spill or flood in the labtoeliminate the chance of an electric shock to the user and the glovebox.  Ifaglovebox has an electrical shock from water it can burn the pressure sensorcausing a glove to blow off thus exposing highly sensitive chemicals to theroom atmosphere in which they can burn.Protective relays- relays that will break if any motorized component is notmaintained properly. i.e. blower, vacuum pump, etc.  The protective relaywillbreak if to many amps are drawn to help in the elimination of expensivecomponents breaking due to improper maintenance.  For example if the dustfilters were not changed the blower will draw more amps then normal andblowthe breaker before the blower dies for good.Glove ports are of a solvent resistant Teflon based material where othermanufacturers use Aluminum, which may corrode, with solvent use.Antechambers are stainless steel and not aluminum.Burkert gas valves are made with Teflon plungers.Vacuum pump is 10 cfm standard. A strong vacuum pump is necessary to gothroughthe antechamber faster and perform regenerations that are much moreeffectiveboth of the result in more research time for my group.Safety system through the PLC does not allow the user to make mistakes suchasstarting a regeneration while circulating.  The user will get an "unlogiccondition" message.  Also factory set pressure alarms so a glove does notimplode or explode.NOTICE:  ALL TECHNICAL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE ABOVE ITEM SHOULD BEDIRECTEDTO MR. CHRISTOPHER MATRANGA AT 412-386-4114.The provisions at 52.212-2 Evaluation  Commercial Items (JAN 1999) doesnotapply to this acquisition.  Instead, the following information will be usedforevaluation of offerors:  An award shall be made to the responsible offerorsubmitting a technically acceptable quote and offering the lowest evaluatedprice.  Evaluation is based on best value including cost and ability tomeetstated requirements above.  Offerors shall submit descriptive literatureanddrawings detailing features, technical capabilities and warranty data.Technical acceptability will be determined solely on the content and meritofthe information submitted response to this provision as it compares to theminimum characteristics provided above.  Therefore, it is essential thatofferors provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., inorderfor the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessmentofthe quote as meeting technical acceptability.  Price shall be the decidingfactor among technically acceptable quotes.  All interested firms mustrespondto DE-RQ26-08NT000682 by 05:30 P.M. EST, JUNE 30, 2008.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center has a requirement for the development of anoptical amplifier for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. NASA/GSFChas been conducting science and technology studies for the LISA instrument, from conceptthrough prototype stages. A study of issues, detailed plans and cost estimate for thedevelopment of space-qualification of the laser transmitters for the future LISAinstrument are required. A major part of this effort will be identification and reductionof risks associated with the fabrication and space qualification of the lasertransmitters. A key identified risk of the proposed system is the tapered fiber bundle(TFB) that combines the light from discrete laser pump diodes. This procurement involves risk reduction activities for the tapered fiber bundle (TFB) tobe used in the Lucent power amplifier design. The following work shall be conducted overa one (1) year period of performance:1) The vendor shall conduct studies to optically characterize the TFB (insertion loss andPER) over temperature (5 to 75 C) on assembled packages.2) The vendor shall perform thermal screening under high power in vacuum.3) The vendor shall provide optical characterization over temperature on fully packagedand screened components.4) The vendor shall perform periodic optical characterization during temperature cyclingto identify performance degradation.Key questions to address in the study are the following:1) What are the product variabilities of the TFBs?2) What is the stability of the TFB optical performance?The overall goal is to reduce risk in the components by identifying performance issuesearly in the program. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Diagnosis Program (DCP) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), 1124 Columbia St., C2-023, Seattle, WA 98104 for services regarding specimen preparation for the BCR-ABL Assay Standardization Project.<br /> <br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard is $6.5M</p>
<p>Period of performance:  Performance shall be from date of award through September 30, 2008.</p>
<p>The Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) supports the development and evaluation of molecular diagnostics for clinical practice.  Acceptance by clinicians of the BCR-ABL assay for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) is limited by the lack of standardization among the American laboratories that perform the assay. The assay uses quantitative RT-PCR, and despite being performed in CLIA-certified laboratories, one laboratory's results cannot be directly compared to another's.  Currently many American laboratories perform this assay using different protocols and different control genes. There are no commonly used calibrators to standardize the assay.  This contract will support preparation of specimens and calibrators to be used by other laboratories to assess whether use of a uniform RNA calibrator improves standardization of this assay.</p>
<p>The contractor must have access to a large collection of clinical samples and have created a unique RNA calibrator for the BCR-ABL assay for CML.  The calibrator must be stable in Trizol when mixed with normal reference RNA and be able to quantify the number of BCR-ABL transcripts per &micro;g of RNA extracted from peripheral blood of patients with CML.  The contractor must be able to perform the BCR-ABL assay on peripheral blood in a CLIA-certified laboratory with CLIA-certified procedures and protocols.  The contractor must also be able to provide the number of samples and calibrators specified by the NCI in Trizol solution, code them according to the NCI-supplied study design and distribute them with the appropriate protocols and procedures for storing and handling the specimens to the testing laboratories as specified by the NCI and.  The contractor must measure the BCR-ABL levels in the specimens prior to distribution and as the testing laboratories are finishing their second batch of assays in their CLIA-certified laboratory as directed by the NCI.</p>
<p>The FHCRC is internationally recognized as a sole resource for this study because of the laboratory's expertise on the BCR-ABL assay for CML in America.  The FHCRC has access to a large collection of clinical samples and one of the few CLIA-certified laboratories that has access to the numbers of specimens required for this study.  The FHCRC has strong support for the standardization of the BCR-ABL assay and creation of a unique RNA calibrator that will be assessed as an external standard for this assay.  Thus, the FHCRC is the pre-eminent American institution for standardizing this assay.  The FHCRC and the CLIA-certified laboratory of Dr. Radich are uniquely qualified to perform the tasks required to support this initial phase of standardizing the BCR-ABL assay.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<RESPDATE>070108
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov - Malinda L Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email holdcram@exchange.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis, Serum estradiol and androstanediol glucuronide levels among participants in the study of testicular germ cell tumors (the STEED study) with Boston Children’s Hospital; Department of Laboratory Medicine; Clinical and Epidemiologic Research Laboratory; Boston, Massachusetts  02115.

The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 the business size standard is 6.5 M employees.

The objective of this project is to determine levels of estradiol and  androstanediol glucuronide (AAG) in the serum of the cases and controls in the STEED testicular germ cell tumor study, and to provide support for the measurement of estradiol in 1400 serum samples necessary to complete the project objective.

The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months from the date of award.

The NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics has conducted a case-control study of testicular germ cell tumors (the STEED study) among U.S. military servicemen.  A unique feature of the study is that pre-diagnostic serum samples are available from the study participants.  These samples have enabled the examination of several important hypotheses, including those related to pesticide exposure and insulin-like growth factor levels.  Another key hypothesis is whether men who develop testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are predisposed because they have aberrant hormone levels prior to the development of disease.  To examine this hypothesis, the study proposed to examine levels of both pituitary (luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone) and steroid (testosterone, estradiol, sex-hormone binding globulin) hormones.  Thus far, levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone have been determined.  Levels of sex-hormone binding globulin and total testosterone are currently being measured.  The final hormones of interest are estradiol and androstanediol glucuronide (AAG).  The original expectation was that both hormones would be measured in the same endocrine laboratory that has measured the other hormones.  

At this point, there is only 200µL of serum left in each sample, so conventional estradiol assays can not be run.  Boston Children’s Hospital – Department of Laboratory Medicine has developed an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay that can determine estradiol and AAG in a very small volume, 200µL, of serum.  Using this assay would permit the STEED study to examine the prestated hypothesis of determining whether aberrant estradiol levels were associated with the development of testicular germ cell tumors.  There is no other source known to the NCi that has a laboratory that can perform this assay using a small amount serum. 

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 a.m. ET on July 1, 2008. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to Malinda Holdcraft: holdcram@exchange.nih.gov. It is the vendor’s responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid, updated registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The Illumina Genome Analyzer is a currently installed instrument which generates large quantities of DNA sequence in a single run (approximately 1Gb) in the form of millions of short reads (25-35 nucleotides in length).  This has become an important technology within NCI for a number of DNA sequencing applications.  However, the very short sequence reads are difficult to align with the normal reference genome.  The sequencer as currently configured reads only one end of the template molecule.  

Illumina has released a hardware module (the PE Module) which can be installed in the existing sequencer as an upgrade which allows sequencing of both ends of the template generating “paired end reads”.  The result of installation of this upgrade will be doubling the sequence productivity of the instrument with a substantial increase in the fraction of template molecules which can be successfully aligned to the human genome.  In cancer research applications, this will also allow the recognition of cancer specific abnormalities that have developed between the two ends of the template molecule.  The requested module is the only product available to modify the existing instrument to generate paired end reads. No competing module is available.  The only alternative would be an entirely new sequencer outfitted for paired end reads procured from Illumina or another vendor at greater than 10 times the cost of the upgrade module. The proposed contractor, Illumina Inc., built the instrument and is the sole source of qualified parts for the instrument due to proprietary technology within the instrument.

Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition: 

1          Statute:  This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers   may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  

No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.  

Justification:  

The cited authority is being used to propose that Illumina Inc., supply the require instrument. The module must provide fully automated template preparation for the second round of sequencing in a paired-end sequencing run.  It must work with the Illumina Genome Analyzer to generate &#8805;36 bp reads from both ends of the templates in the library for a total of &#8805;3 Gb of paired-end data per run.  Paired-end sequencing data is required by CCR for long-range positional information and easy detection of structural variations such as chromosomal rearrangements, copy number variations, and insertions deletions (indels).

The Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), recently installed two Illumina Genome Analyzers, that are being used to generate large quantities of DNA sequencing in a single run (approximately 1 Gb) in the form of millions of short, >36 bp reads.  However, as configured, the sequencers produce sequences that difficult to align to reference genomes because the reads are from only one end of the template molecule.  The CCR now requires the ability to sequence both ends of a template molecule using a module that can be easy attached to the existing Illumina Genome Analyzers and used after completion of the first read to regenerate the templates in situ. The module must be able to connect to the Genome Analyzer through a single fluidic connection, providing a walk-away automated workflow. 

Additional salient characteristics of the paired-end sequencing module include:

•	Simple workflow: must use the same simple protocol to create single-read or paired-end gDNA libraries in <8 hours; generate clonal clusters in <7 hours with <2 hours of hands-on time
•	Low sample amount: must be able to use &#8804; 1 µg of DNA to generate human genomic paired-end DNA libraries
•	Highest daily throughput: generate &#8805; 3 Gb of data in no more than 5 days; 2× &#8805;36 bp reads for &#8805;600 Mb per day
•	Optimal data density: must obtain highly granular sequence information with optimal insert sizes of 200-500 bp; paired-end protocol must also be compatible with larger DNA fragment libraries
•	Highest quality data: must achieve &#8805;99.99% consensus accuracy at &#8805;3× coverage

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Hamamatsu Corporation, 350 Foothill Road, Bridgewater, NJ 08807, for the purchase of a CMOS Flat Panel Sensor.    

The reference number NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2008-118-DDC. 

The Government’s estimated expected delivery date is thirty calendar days after receipt of the purchase order.

The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Bethesda, Maryland.

The technical specification required for the CMOS X-ray sensor must consist of at least 600 by 600 pixels, Pixel size 200 x 200 um, sensitivity of at least 6000 lsb/mR.  It must be able to take 30 frames per second, and control by a computer using Labview software.  The output image must be as least 12 bits.  The X-ray sensor must work in a strong magnetic field, and be able to detect X-rays at a 45-degree angle.  The unit cannot be any more than 20 mm thick and must not have a metal enclosure or other large metal parts.

Market Research conducted by the Government has determined that the equipment can be provided only by Hamamatsu Corporation.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that the Government is starting a project to combine x-ray and MRI imaging. This requires placing an x-ray imager in the patient’s bed of an MRI scanner.  In order for this to be accomplished, the Government requires a sensor that is flat with high magnetic field and also has few metal parts (as describe in the above specifications).     The Hamamatsu C10322D is the only flat panel sensor that is not in a metal enclosure.  The sensor will involve doctors being near the patient as the x-ray images are taken.  Therefore, it is to the Government’s best interest to purchase a sensor that will reduce the exposure of radiation as much as possible.  

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.  Size Standard is 500 employees. The small business set-aside does not apply. This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures, and exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.  Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number  NHLBI-PB(HL)-2008-118-DDC  may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention Deborah Coulter.  Response may be submitted electronically to coulterd@nhlbi.nih.gov or cbelt@nhlbi.nih.gov and by fax to (301) 480-3345.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
(JUN 2006)

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

__ it is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73, but it plans to submit a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.104-74.
(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<p>NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES: NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS INFORMATIONAL REQUEST</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Division of Consumer and Business Education (DCBE) is seeking sources and capabilities information in the planning, implementation, and marketing of a campaign dealing with advertising that would teach tweens (children between the ages of eight and twelve) and the adults in their lives to be more discerning consumers of information. The information below provides the background, essential elements and processes expected to be obtained through a future contract action in the pursuit of this endeavor.</p>
<p>If your firm is interested in participating in this effort, please submit a letter of interest to Edwin Franklin at: efranklin@ftc.gov by close of the business day on Monday, Jun 23, 2008. Please provide, in addition to your letter of interest, your firm's capabilities information, examples of successful past performance of a similar nature, information representing your firm's status under the Small Business Act, contract numbers if your firm currently holds a GSA Federal Supply Services contract for this type of service or any other federally-placed IDIQ contract for similar services, and any other information that might be useful to us in our planning process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advertising Literacy Campaign</p>
<p>Agency Overview</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) works for the consumer to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices in the marketplace and to provide information to help consumers spot, stop, and avoid them. The FTC maintains a website, www.ftc.gov, and a national toll-free telephone line (1-877-FTC-HELP) to respond to requests for information and accept consumer complaints.</p>
<p>As the nation's consumer protection agency, the FTC, through its Division of Advertising Practices, enforces truth-in-advertising laws, monitors and develops effective enforcement strategies for new advertising techniques and media, such as word-of-mouth marketing; monitors and reports on the advertising of food to children, including the impact of practices by food companies and the media on childhood obesity; and monitors and reports on industry practices regarding the marketing of violent movies, music, and electronic games to children.</p>
<p>Building on that expertise, the FTC, through its Division of Consumer and Business Education (DCBE), will develop an interactive campaign dealing with advertising that would teach tweens and the adults in their lives to be more discerning consumers of information. DCBE produces and disseminates objective, practical and plain language information to consumers, and has created a network of partners and intermediaries that includes public agencies at the federal, state and local levels, industry associations, and non-profit and advocacy organizations. The issues covered range from identity theft to online safety; green marketing to health claims; from telemarketing fraud to phishing - and include a soon-to-be launched website to explain the FTC to kids ages 10-14. The agency is a trusted brand for consumers and businesses, and has an excellent reputation among media outlets for the "news" of the day, as well for the "news people can use." In building out this particular campaign, the FTC is seeking guidance from a contractor with experience and expertise in reaching youngsters, as well as their parents and educators.</p>
<p>We recommend that interested parties review the FTC's consumer education materials for an understanding of the many issues the FTC manages. These sites are available at www.ftc.gov/bcp/consumer.shtm.</p>
<p>Interested parties also should review the following education campaign web sites and products for an appreciation of the latest initiatives and strategies implemented:</p>
<p>1. Consumer education video on how to avoid ID theft www.ftc.gov/idtheft<br />2. Interactive games and quizzes about Internet safety www.onguardonline.gov/quiz/index.html<br />3. Phishing videos: www.youtube.com/user/FTCvideos <br />4. Teaser sites: www.wemarket4u.net/fatfoe/index.html, www.wemarket4u.net/glucobate/index.html<br />5. Teen drinking prevention: www.dontserveteens.gov/ <br />6.

<p>Draft Campaign Overview</p>
<p>Advertising in America is a multi-billion dollar a year business. Truthful advertising provides consumers with the information they need to make better-informed purchasing decisions. It also gives companies an incentive to include features in their products that consumers want.</p>
<p>Children have tremendous spending power. For example, tweens spend about $51 billion annually, and their parents and family members spend an additional $170 billion on them. More than a third of parents with children between the ages of six and 11 in the household say that their children can significantly influence their purchasing decisions. By some estimates, American companies are spending $10-12 billion a year on advertising and marketing related to youth 2-18 (including ads targeted to adults for youth-related products and services). Recognizing this, advertisers and marketers have made children a focal point of advertising and marketing programs. For example, it has been estimated that, each year, the average American child between the ages of two and 11 sees 25,600 television commercials. About 22 percent of these ads are for food; 29 percent promote other TV programs; 8 percent are for games, toys, and hobbies; another 8 percent are for screen and audio entertainment; and 3 percent are for OTC medicines. Children as young as three recognize brand logos, with brand loyalty influence starting at age two. About 53 percent of tweens and 29 percent of teens report that they try to buy products that they've seen on TV or in the movies.</p>
<p>Given this phenomenon, the FTC proposes to develop an interactive campaign focused on advertising literacy. The campaign will educate children aged 8-12, and the adults in their lives, to be more discerning consumers of information. The FTC seeks to be neither pro- nor anti-advertising; rather, it wants to help kids better understand advertising. The goals of the campaign are to raise awareness of advertising and marketing messages; increase knowledge of how to skillfully read, analyze, and understand an advertisement; and demonstrate the benefits of being an informed consumer. The content of the campaign will be provided by the FTC, and be based upon the agency's experience with the subject matter, a public workshop to be held in 2008-2009, and the experiences of a network of partners.</p>
<p>Central to the campaign are some common-sense questions to help young people use critical thinking skills to become savvy consumers in today=s media-rich world:</p>
<p>1. Who is responsible for the ad? Kids should know that whoever is responsible for an ad will have a goal in mind, and that will influence the message in the ad. <br />2. What is the ad actually saying? This may be obvious in a traditional commercial or print ad, but can be less so in other forms of advertising, including games, product integration, or mobile marketing. The campaign will show kids how to decode and deconstruct ads, no matter what form they take, to find the basic message directed to them.<br />3. Why is the ad there? The campaign will ask kids to think about the call to action in the ad, and what the advertiser wants them to do.</p>
<p>Once exposed to those central messages, the target audience(s) should understand that ads are constructed to give them information and to persuade them to take some action - whether it=s doing something to help themselves or society, being more aware of an issue, buying a particular product, or something else.</p>
<p>While the focus of the campaign is on advertising and marketing - helping young people and their parents analyze advertising messages - the critical thinking skills that are central to the campaign, and that kids are learning in other contexts, will be helpful as they interact with all kinds of media throughout their lives.</p>
<p>The FTC will be seeking a contractor to provide a variety of services in support of this campaign to empower children and their parents to be more discerning consumers of information. The contractor shall demonstrate experience: 1) developing successful interactive, multi-media, web-based methods for communicating with young audiences; 2) developing curricula to deliver content to young people; 3) developing engaging, inviting and appropriate materials to deliver content to young people; and 4) successfully marketing this information to young people, whether through media or through developing partnerships with influential organizations (schools, libraries, other organizations). <br /><br />Target Audiences</p>
<p>The primary audience for this campaign is youngsters aged 8-12. The advertising industry itself talks of the buying power - and influence - of this cohort, and continues to find new ways to reach them, including viral marketing, advergaming, and other interactive media.</p>
<p>In addition, both research and observation tell us that children experience media differently than adults; in fact, children=s ability to comprehend and evaluate advertising messages has spurred a good deal of debate and research over the past 30 years. One conclusion by researchers is that children in different age groups have different information processing skills. Many categorize children aged 8-12 as "cued processors" - able to retrieve and use information, engaging critical thinking skills, but only when cued. Kids in this age group tend not to think critically and often fail to differentiate between central and peripheral content when learning new information. Our aim is to give them some tools they can use, and some cues on when to use them at a time when many of them are starting to have their own money, make independent purchasing decisions, and exert influence on the family=s buying decisions.</p>
<p>The secondary audience for this campaign includes parents and educators, primarily as a mechanism to reinforce the questions and concepts being delivered to the 8-12-year-old target audience. Both parents and teachers can help cue these children to apply critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>We are seeking parties that may be interested in assisting FTC in this proposed campaign that have experience reaching:<br />&bull; Children aged 8-12<br />&bull; Parents and other caregivers<br />&bull; Teachers and other educators</p>
<p>Areas of Interest</p>
<p>The FTC seeks firms that are interested in assisting the agency in the design, implementation and marketing of a campaign to promote advertising literacy, including the following:</p>
<p>1. Developing successful interactive, multimedia, web-based methods for communicating with young audiences: This will involve working with the FTC to create and implement an interactive website designed to engage youngsters in the target age group. Games and activities should illustrate the core concepts and key questions about understanding advertising. The site also will have sections with resources for parents and teachers to use and download. The construction of the interactive website is expected to occupy much of the first year of the campaign.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the tasks will include developing innovative tools to enhance the agency's ability to effectively and efficiently deliver the campaign message to both primary and secondary target audiences. Products to be created may include print materials, and CDs and DVDs suitable for use in schools and libraries.</p>
<p>2. Developing curricula to deliver content to young people: This will include creating engaging, creative, and interactive curricula that teach children 8-12 about advertising.</p>
<p>3. Developing engaging, inviting and appropriate materials to deliver content to young people: This will include developing engaging, creative, and useful materials to support the campaign messages about recognizing and decoding advertising. These materials might include print, audio, video, and other multimedia materials.</p>
<p>4. Success in marketing information to young people: This will include developing and carrying out a plan to market the campaign's resources to the target audience (including children aged 8-12, parents, and educators). A challenge of the campaign will be to cut through the clutter that children hear and see in the media everyday, developing messages that resonate with them, and finding ways to deliver the message in ways they will see, use, and learn from it. Using the same channels that advertisers and marketers use to communicate with kids may be more likely to be successful in reaching and resonating with the target audience, so the contractor shall consider those in developing and carrying out a marketing plan.</p>
<p><br />Period of Performance:</p>
<p>The Period of Performance for this campaign is initially expected to include a one-year base period with three one-year optional periods.</p>
<p>Budgetary Amount:</p>
<p>The FTC has budgeted about $2 million a year for this campaign.</p>

<DESC>A.  General Information<BR>Northwest Region seeks to initiate the standardization process for Epidural & Spinal Trays for its 7 Army, Navy, and Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alaska & Washington.  Standardization for this product line represents a previously standardized product line initiative for this Region. The Region originally completed this product line for standardization in 03/03, and it expired 06/07  This product line includes a full line of Epidural & Spinal Trays in various sizes and descriptions, as detailed in 1a of the Technical Criteria below, Usage Items. <BR><BR>Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for Quotes (RFQ).  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Bassett Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA; Fairchild AFB Clinic, Fairchild AFB, WA; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR> The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is 10/08.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>The Point of Contact is Diane Mathews, phone: 253-968-3115, and e-mail diane.mathews@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR> B.      Products & Performance Required <BR>The Region is seeking Epidural & Spinal Trays which at a minimum include the product lines below.   Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual demand of $166,594.  This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period.  T<BR>he top high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR><BR>Epidural Kit Anesthesia, Epidural Tray Continuous Perifix Fx, Sd20td Epidural Tray Sgl Dose P66, P25bk Spinal Tray, Spinal Tray With Pencan 25gx3.5in Needle, Ce18tkcd Epidural Tray Continuous, Epidural Cont Hustead 18g With Drugs, Epidural Anest Lor Pulsator Syringe, Spinal Anes Tray Whit25g3.5 L/L-D 2t2023, Spinal Epidural Tray Espocan Es1725kfx<BR><BR>At the request of the Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor<BR>C.      Instructions to Vendors <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to diane.mathews@amedd.army.mil.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Northwest Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR>D.       Evaluation Criteria <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR>The TPRB intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the TPRB reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed in the FBO RFQ.   Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/ company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company           criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a. Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b. The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.<BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR>1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Epidural and Spinal products. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  At a minimum, a complete product line includes:<BR><BR>a.	Standard epidural trays must be capable of meeting the diverse patient and clinician needs in the Region.   In addition to the typical items in a standard epidural tray (i.e.: sterile outer wrap, injection needles and syringes, fenestrated and towel drapes, gauze pads, etc.), the users should be able to choose a standard set that gives them choices from among the following options:<BR><BR>i.	Epidural needles in sizes from 16 gauge to 20 gauge, from 3.5 to 6 long, with centimeter markings.<BR>ii.	Flexible regular or coil-spring wire interior epidural catheters, open-tip or closed-tip, in sizes from 18 gauge to 20 gauge, sized to fit the needle provided in the tray.  <BR>iii.	LOR (loss of resistance) syringe, 5cc to 10 cc, plastic or glass, Luer-lock or Luer-slip hub.<BR>iv.	Skin antiseptic of iodine solution, iodine/alcohol solution, tinted chlorhexidine, or tinted chlorhexidine/alcohol solution.<BR>v.	Labels to identify epidural catheter and medications drawn into syringes.<BR>vi.	Medications:  Lidocaine HCl, 1.5% with epinephrine; Lidocaine HCl, 1%; Sodium Chloride 0.9% <BR>vii.	Filter needle or filter straw for drawing up ampoule medications.<BR><BR>b.	Standard spinal trays must be capable of meeting the diverse patient and clinician needs in the Region.  In addition to the typical items in a standard spinal tray (i.e.: sterile outer wrap, 20 gauge introducer needle, injection needles and syringes, fenestrated and towel drapes, gauze pads, etc.), the users should be able to choose a standard set that gives them choices from among the following options:<BR><BR>i.	Pencil-point spinal needles in sizes from 24 gauge to 27 gauge, and lengths from 3.5 to 5.5.<BR>ii.	Skin antiseptic of iodine solution, iodine/alcohol solution, tinted chlorhexidine, or tinted chlorhexidine/alcohol solution.<BR>iii.	Labels to identify medications drawn into syringes.<BR>iv.	Medications:  Lidocaine HCl 1%, Epinephrine 0.1%; Sodium Chloride 0.9%; Bupivacaine 0.75% MPF, Bupivacaine 0.75% with Dextrose 8.25%.<BR>v.	Filter needle or filter straw for drawing up ampoule medications.<BR><BR>c.	Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  <BR><BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA, or be in the process of applying for a DAPA, for the Epidural and Spinal Product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR><BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Regions Prime Vendor (currently, Cardinal Health is the PV for distribution in Region 11.)  Please provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Regional PV will be disqualified.)<BR><BR>4.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  <BR>a.	Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  <BR>b.	Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.<BR>c.	Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.<BR><BR>5.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative in the Northwest Region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.<BR><BR>6.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for items in their epidural/spinal product line, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  <BR>a.	Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  <BR>b.	Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.<BR>c.	Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.  Additionally, the Government will not contact any points of contact that are provided in response to this question.<BR><BR>7.	Vendors must provide in-service staff training and identify company resources for such requirements with the initial submittals.  (Provide literature on the training, if available.)<BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process:  The CPT developed a list of items from the product group to evaluate. The determination of the sample set was based on advances in technology, patient safety, and on historical usage for the product line. The CPT also determined that the clinical/performance evaluation will be performed in a clinical, patient care setting. <BR> <BR>1.	The following procedures will apply. <BR><BR>a.	The TRBO office will request a no charge clinical evaluation sample set from each of the vendors with a required delivery date 30 days from date of request. <BR>b.	Each vendor will send the samples directly to the participating MTFs at the addresses listed at the end of this announcement. <BR>c.	All email communications between vendors and the region concerning sample set shipment will be digitally signed.<BR>d.	Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arrival will be disqualified from the standardization process.<BR>e.	Due to the potential for samples to become lost or delayed in shipping, all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor, and anticipated delivery date.  <BR><BR>2.	The samples to be provided are as follows: <BR><BR>a.	Epidural catheterization tray that includes a 19 Ga. epidural catheter with interior coil-spring and open-end tip, 17 Ga. x 3.5 winged Tuohy needle with centimeter markings, 5cc Luer-slip glass LOR syringe, and a clear fenestrated drape<BR>b.	Epidural catheterization tray that includes a 19 Ga. epidural catheter with interior coil-spring and closed-end tip, 17 Ga. x 3.5 winged Tuohy needle with centimeter markings, 5cc Luer-slip glass LOR syringe, and a clear fenestrated drape.<BR>c.	Epidural catheterization tray that includes a 20 Ga. epidural catheter and closed-end tip, 18 Ga. x 3.5 winged Tuohy needle with centimeter markings, 5cc Luer-slip glass LOR syringe, and a clear fenestrated drape.<BR>d.	Combined spinal/epidural catheterization tray that includes a 19 Ga. epidural catheter with interior coil-spring and open-end tip, 17 Ga. x 3.5 winged Tuohy needle with centimeter markings, 26 Ga. x 5 pencil-point spinal needle, 5cc Luer-slip glass LOR syringe, and a clear fenestrated drape.<BR>e.	Spinal anesthesia tray that includes 25 Ga. x 3.5 pencil-point spinal needle, Bupivacaine 0.75% Methyl Paraben Free (MPF), and a clear fenestrated drape.<BR>f.	10cc plastic LOR syringe.<BR>g.	5cc Luer-lock glass LOR syringe.<BR>h.	17 Ga. x 4.5 winged Tuohy needle.<BR>i.	25 Ga. x 5.5 pencil-point spinal needle.<BR>j.	27 Ga. x 3.5 pencil-point spinal needle.<BR><BR>3.	The CPT will evaluate each product against the clinical/performance criteria. All criteria will carry equal weight.  The evaluation will take place in a clinical patient care setting.  <BR><BR>4.	The evaluation responses will represent a clinical value judgment placed in a Likert-like scale with a 1 to 5 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree or no; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree or yes; 5 = Strongly Agree).  Comments will be invited and recorded on the evaluations.  .<BR><BR>5.	The CPT has set a clinical acceptability threshold target at 3.1.  The CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative  at or near 3.1  depending on the location of any break (or gap) in vendors average scores.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.1, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted clinical/performance criteria.  All criteria will be evaluated in a patient care setting, during the process of establishing an epidural and/or spinal block.  Practitioners will perform at least 2 blocks in order to evaluate each criterion:    <BR><BR>1.  Sterile patient fenestrated drape provided does not obscure anatomical landmarks.<BR>a.	Rationale: with patient in a side-lying or seated position for epidural cannulation, it is essential to see the anatomical landmarks to insure the appropriate needle insertion site and trajectory.  Otherwise, the incorrect intra-spinous space may be entered or the needle may travel askew.<BR>b.	Method:  The practitioner will place the fenestrated drape and observe whether the anatomical landmarks are obscured.<BR>2.	Compartments in tray are configured to hold contents firmly, in an intuitive order, and in a ready-to-use layout. <BR>a.	Rationale: Clinician time is wasted and efficiency decreased if they must reorganize a tray if the prepping products, needles, syringes, catheters and medications in the tray get displaced during shipping, or are packaged haphazardly in the tray.<BR>b.	Method:  The practitioner will open an epidural tray, establish a sterile field, and use the products in the tray in order to assess if the tray is configured to hold contents firmly, in an intuitive order, and in ready-to-use layout. <BR>3.	Epidural needle is sturdy, has a smooth end curve, and has an aperture that allows drag-free passage of epidural catheter into epidural space. <BR>a.	Rationale:  The needle must be sturdy enough to pass through a variety of soft and ligamentous tissue before reaching the epidural space, it must be curved appropriately to direct the catheter into the space, and it must not damage the catheter as it passes through.<BR>b.	Method:  The practitioner will insert the epidural needle and thread the epidural catheter into the epidural space in order to assess if the needle is sturdy, has a smooth end curve, and has an aperture that allows drag-free passage of the catheter into the space.<BR>4.	Epidural catheter that features a coil-spring wire interior is flexible to allow atraumatic cannulation of the epidural space.<BR>a.	Rationale:  If catheter is not flexible enough, it may increase incidence of paresthesia and vessel or dural puncture.<BR>b.	Method:  The practitioner will insert the epidural needle and thread the epidural catheter into the epidural space in order to assess if the catheter is flexible enough to allow non-traumatic cannulation of the epidural space.<BR>5.	LOR syringe (glass or plastic) has plunger that seals effectively, but slides smoothly without requiring lubrication.<BR>a.	Rationale: LOR [loss-or-resistance] syringe must provide a drag-free, smooth plunger action to avoid accidental dural puncture.<BR>b.	Method:  The practitioner will insert the epidural needle and attach the LOR syringe.  As the needle/syringe unit is advanced, the practitioner will evaluate how well the plunger seals and slides as the syringe is used to identify the moment the loss of resistance occurs.<BR>6.	Catheter-hub assembly holds securely without leaking.<BR>a.	Rationale:  The connection between the epidural catheter and the source of the medication must be secure to avoid diversion of the medication intended to be instilled into the epidural space, and therefore failing to provide the desired anesthetic block.  Loose connections also provide an entry for bacteria into the epidural space. <BR>b.	Method:  The practitioner will insert the epidural catheter, inject fluid through hub assembly into the catheter, and observe for leaks.<BR>7.	Spinal pencil-point needle is sturdy in small-gauge sizes (26-27 Ga).<BR>a.	Rationale:  The needle must be sturdy to pass through a variety of soft and ligamentous tissue before reaching the dura, yet small enough gauge to aid in the prevention of PDPH (post-dural puncture headache).<BR>b.	Method:  The practitioner will insert a 26 Ga or 27 Ga spinal needle and assess its sturdiness as it passes through soft and ligamentous tissue. <BR><BR>Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.1 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with three (3) one-year option periods.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements. (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines. (3) Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>The unique design of Synthes' retractor set allows placement of the retractor throughout the procedure without having to be removed and replaced several times.  Since this retractor is radiolucent, it can remain in the wound while X-rays are taken.  A retractor that is not radiolucent has to be set, removed and reset several times throughout the case; this increases chances for damage or complications; once a retractor is set in a good spot, it may be difficult to get it reset to the "perfect" spot when it is constantly being moved. This retractor can serve a dual purpose, serving both specialties that perform this type of surgical procedure.  This reduces the need to have separate retractors for each specialty.

Manufacturing 
RAD Buddy Smart Dosimeter
Related Patents:   US 6,765,214 B1
The RAD Buddy Smart Dosimeter is a radiation dosimeter which monitors and evaluates radiological risks.  The dosimeter provides an audible alarm indication reminding the user to check the dosimeter indication periodically, that a predetermined accumulated dose has been prematurely reached, and that the safe “stay time” has elapsed.  The dosimeter has a small 4-digit LCD display with “stay time” programming pushbuttons, a watch-type battery, a miniature alarm (buzzer), and a reset switch.  It also includes a built-in Bluetooth connection for transmitting data.

Accu-Frisk-Radiation Survey Rate and Distance Monitor
Related Patents:  Patent Pending 
There are many errors that can occur when frisking an area for radiation. INL engineers have developed the Accu- Frisk Radiation Survey Rate and Distance Monitor that combats the three most frequent errors in frisking. Accu-Frisk is an inexpensive, handheld battery operated radiation detection device designed to assist First Responder and Hazmat teams.  It solves the three primary errors when frisking: moving too quickly over an area (turbo frisking), holding the device to far away from the surface, and bringing the probe in contact with a contaminated surface.  

NORMS (Network-Oriented Radiation Monitoring System)
Related Patents:  Patent Pending 
Summary:

NORMS is a new radiation detection monitoring technology, which can improve safeguards to protect against a variety of unwanted events, such as theft of nuclear weapons and special nuclear materials and radiological sabotage.

<DESC>"Rotary Airlock Feeders are used in pneumatic conveying systems, dust control equipment, and as volumetric feed-controls to maintain an even flow of material through processing systems. The basic use of the rotary airlock feeder is as an airlock transition point, sealing pressurized systems against loss of air or gas while maintaining a flow of material between components with different pressure. Rotary Airlock Feeders are also widely used as volumetric feeders for metering materials at precise flow rates from bins, hoppers or silos into conveying or processing systems.  The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has developed a novel rotary transport system designed to move large quantities of biomass and other materials across pressure differentials while maintaining consistent and continuous flow rates.  The initial focus of the devise is to deliver biomass to gasification processes.  The patented design extends current rotary airlock devices to include a pressure locked chamber that provides for continuous transport of materials across pressure differentials while maintaining consistent flow rates and gas species.  The design provides for a robust and adaptable framework that could be used in satisfying a diverse set of material handling requirements. The INL is soliciting interest from companies that are willing to collaborate with the INL in designing, fabricating and testing the rotary system.  Additional information is available under nondisclosure agreement.  Interested parties should provide a written response to the INL on or before July 31, 2008.

Title:  Gradient Elution Moving Boundary Electrophoresis

Description:  	Gradient Elution Moving Boundary Electrophoresis (GEMBE) is a method for performing electrophoretic separation and/or purification of
compounds in a mixture. The essence of the invention is the use of a variable bulk flow in electrophoresis. The method uses the electrophoretic migration of chemical species in solution in combination with variable hydrodynamic bulk flow of the solution through a separation capilary or
microfluidic channeL. GEMBE can be used with the bulk flow solution flow in either direction with respect to the electrophoretic driving force. Continuous sample introduction eliminates the need for a sample injection mechanism, allowing for significant miniaturization.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI) Regarding Technology Maturation Efforts
<SOLNBR>N00019-08-P1-ZA240
<RESPDATE>070908
<CONTACT>Carolyn A Abney, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-757-7060, Email carolyn.abney@navy.mil - Rebecca A Woods, Phone (301) 757-7059, Email rebecca.woods1@navy.mil
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). THERE IS CURRENTLY NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE, NOR IS A DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED SOLICITATION PACKAGE ANTICIPATED. Program Executive Office (Tactical Aircraft Programs) (PEO(T)) is seeking historical information regarding technology maturation efforts. This information will be used to develop metrics regarding planned versus actual experience with maturing of technologies from Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 3 through 9, with particular interest in TRL growth from 3 through 6. The contractor is asked to provide information relative to its experience with maturing technology from early levels to its final form and under mission conditions (TRL 9), with particular interest in those that have proven ready for system level development and integration through successful completion of system/subsystem model, or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment (TRL 6).

History: Department of Defense Instruction 5000.2 [3.7.2] requires acquisition programs to assess technology maturity levels prior to proceeding to a Milestone B acquisition decision. Because the use of Technology Readiness Levels (1 thought 9) assessments in the Department of Defense is relatively new, limited data exists that can be used to predict, measure, or validate maturity efforts, or estimates as they relate to cost and schedule adherence as that maturity moves from TRL 3 through the remaining levels. To position PEO(T) to better predict and measure technology maturation efforts, it is developing metrics based on actual historical data. Early technology maturation efforts are often conducted by industry and therefore it is believed the government’s data can be optimized by the addition of industry information. 

Scope: Information requested: 1) Name and description of technology maturation effort you are referring to in this request for information; 2) Approximately when did the technology maturation effort start; 3) At what phase in the acquisition cycle was this technology maturation effort; (i.e. Material Solution Analysis, Technology Development, Engineering & Manufacturing, Production & Deployment, Development & Demonstration, Operations & Support); 4) If assigned, what was the ACAT level of the associated program (i.e. ACAT IC, ACAT ID, ACAT II, ACAT III, non-POR; 5) At what technology readiness level did this maturation effort begin, within the scope of this evaluation (3 through 9); 6) At what technology readiness level did this maturation effort end, within the scope of this evaluation (3 through 9); 7) Assuming the technology maturation effort’s originally stated technical performance goal equaled 100%, what level of that goal did the effort actually achieve within the subject maturation effort (i.e. 50% through 100%); 8) Did the performance achieved meet program technical goals at a level of acceptance sufficient to proceed with the program (provide amplifying remarks, if appropriate); 9) Describe the goals and results of the technology maturation effort. (as an example; “the goal of the technology maturation effort was to improve the APX-1234 system’s transmission rate from 24kbps to 10Mbps. The result was; we achieved 5Mbps.”; 10) What was the planned total cost of the technology maturation effort; 11) What was the actual total cost of the technology maturation effort; 12) What was the planned schedule duration, in months, of the technology maturation effort? (Please, be as precise as possible. If not known exactly, please estimate within a range (i.e. 12 – 14 months)); 13) What was the actual schedule duration in months of the technology maturation effort? (Please, be as precise as possible. If not known exactly, please estimate within a range (i.e. 12 – 14 months)); 14) Was there significant contractor IR&D investment used to mature this technology? 15) If “yes”, What amount of contractor IR&D was invested?

Any firms with information relevant to the above are requested to submit the following  in an electronically sortable, commercially available form to the Government: 
1. Answers to the questions above.
2. Amplifying information related to your answers (no more than 50 pages without prior discussions with point of contact below).
3. A point of contact to answer questions concerning your data, if required.
Please provide feedback on this request. All comments or information pertaining to improving or enhancing the government’s ability to measure technology maturation efforts that industry feels appropriate should be submitted. Please limit your response to efforts no older than the last 10 years. Tutorials concerning TRL assessment methodology is not appropriate, or desired. This RFI is issued for the purpose of gathering existing information that can be made available. No information will be traceable by any user(s) to its source upon aggregation of the responses. This announcement is not a formal solicitation and does not constitute a request for proposal. Availability of any formal solicitation will be announced under a separate Federal Business Opportunities announcement. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Each response must reference this RFI number: N00019-08-P1-ZA240. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding upon the government. 
The government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this RFI nor will the government compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing information for the government. The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government without written permission in accordance to the legend. 
It is requested that information be submitted within 15 working days after publication posting of this notice. Any request for copies of solicitations will not be addressed since this is a request for information only and is not a request for proposal.

Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show—

(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;

(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and 
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. 
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. 
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. 
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. 
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and— 
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or 
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or 
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. 
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. 
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers.

(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-25.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  

***This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase a Silicon Drift Detector-based X-ray Microanalysis System for Scanning Electron Microscopes.***

Background:  

The activity of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) laboratory of NIST’s Nanoscale Metrology group involves extensive work on the dimensional measurements of nanometer scale samples and devices. To carry out the work, extremely precise and accurate measurements are necessary. Beyond the size of the nanometer-scale objects, the composition is also important, in some cases since the size information is not unique, only the composition can identify the objects. Modern x-ray microanalysis systems can provide this vital information and are capable of identifying the various materials across the image produced in the scanning electron microscope. These are capable of x-ray collecting maps as well especially with large size detectors that work at high count rates. Silicon drift detectors (SDDs) are the best in the current technical environment, are designed in ways that they can be easily fitted to various SEMs, and are lightweight and do not require liquid nitrogen as the older SiLi x-ray detectors.

NIST’s Nanoscale Metrology group currently owns two Scanning Electron Microscopes:  a FEI Helios and a Hitachi S-5500.  Both SEMs are capable of better than 1 nanometer electron beam focusing.  

***All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Silicon Drift Detector-based X-ray Microanalysis System which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:

1.	Compatible with NIST’s existing FEI Helios Scanning Electron Microscope or its Hitachi S-550 Scanning Electron Microscope.  Compatibility with both SEMs is preferred. 
2.	X-ray detector area is minimum 25 mm2;
3.	Achievable resolution at Mn K alpha shall be at least 136 eV with 60,000 counts/s rate.
4.	Maximum input count rate shall reach or exceed 300,000 counts/s.
5.	Live x-ray map collection capability is required.
6.	Drift correction capability is required.
7.	Sophisticated image processing and quantitative microanalysis capabilities are required.


NIST is offering its existing EDAX Phoenix EDS System as a trade-in.  The existing Phoenix EDS system was purchased from EDAX, Inc. and is approximately 9 years old.  It is configured for a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope.  This system (NIST property tags 599728 and 591657) is in excellent condition.  Contractors interested in offering a discount for the trade-in of this existing system should note the trade-in discount as a line item on their quotation.

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination (Gaithersburg, MD). FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. 

Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, past performance & price shall be considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.  

Technical capability and past performance, when combined, shall be approximately equal importance to price. If Technical Capability and Past Performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.

Under the technical capability factor, stronger consideration will be given to a quoted system that is compatible with both the FEI Helios and Hitachi S-5500 Scattered Electron Microscopes, per line item 0001, specification 1.  

Technical Capability:

Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include the manufacturer or brand name, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which addresses all salient characteristics, and clearly documents that the offered product meets the minimum specifications stated above.

Past Performance:

Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product & service provided and the Contractor’s history of meeting delivery schedules for prior deliverables. Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or the quoters recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its’ affiliates. Offerors must provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar equipment has been provided. The Contractor must include the references name, contact person, and contact information in the quotation.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for: identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country’s political process.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates, the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the “bullpen”, serving on intermittent/part-time contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.

This Scope of Work is Washington, D.C.–based, for those individuals who will be available to work with OTI for short or extended periods of time in Washington, D.C. and the field performing a range of duties outlined in the “Duties and Responsibilities” sections below. Work assignments will range in length depending on the needs of OTI, and availability of the individuals selected for the position(s).  

The Program Advisors are a critical element of OTI’s success in providing fast and flexible responses to key transition needs. The incumbents must possess the program, project management and budgetary skills to help ensure successful start-ups, management, and close-outs of OTI country programs. The complex demands of the position require that the incumbents be readily available for both Washington and field assignments. The Washington assignments many times require immediate response to lengthy and critical tasks and this makes it important that personnel be based in the Washington area. 

The worldwide nature of the OTI program requires Program Advisors who can immediately respond to the challenging and complex demands of OTI projects. The proper execution of OTI programs requires individuals with a high level of managerial and operational skills who are readily available to report for duty in either Washington or field assignments or a combination of both.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this solicitation is to provide on-call program specialist capabilities to the OTI Bullpen.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This position requires excellent management skills, a high degree of communications skills and negotiation ability to serve as a liaison between the Office of Transition Initiatives, DCHA, USAID Washington, and the USAID Mission, Representative or the US Ambassador (in the absence of a USAID Mission). The incumbent will be sent, on an as needed basis, to a wide range of OTI project sites and proposed new country program sites. In some geographic locations this individual will be called upon to work with officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors, and non-governmental organizations. The Program Advisor will report to the Chief of Field Programs or his/her designee.

In the capacity of Program Advisor the incumbent will be responsible for the following types of activities abroad where OTI country programs are in place: assessing the needs of the OTI program, evaluating the work of the grantee, and ensuring the various USG interests are coordinated and policy implemented. The Program Advisor will consult with the Chief of Field Programs, or designee, on a regular basis to develop a clear and coherent basis from which to implement programmatic changes and needs. Assisting in Washington and/or the field with new country program start-ups, providing operational support in periods of need, review and evaluation of ongoing projects, and country-program closeouts will be of particular importance in the work of the Program Advisor.

The Program Advisor will, to the maximum extent possible:

•	Fill critical staffing needs in Washington including the provision of support to new country start-ups and on-call technical assistance;

•	Conduct, with in-country representatives, visits to field sites in areas where OTI has projects;

•	Review and monitor the plans and activities of any OTI grantee and ensure coordination of grantee programs with USAID mission and other international organizations;

•	Execute closeout activities related to OTI programs and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;

•	Advise the Program Office on OTI Program Performance Review process and provide guidance and insights on findings and recommendations;  

•	Review program budgets and propose changes and adjustments and draft any written justifications that will assist in securing quick approvals;

•	Manage final evaluations as guided by the OTI Program Office and/or Field Programs Division; 

•	Update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials.

In new country programs, the Program Advisor will:

•	Participate in assessing the feasibility of the country as a potential candidate for an OTI program;

•	Participate in conceptualizing and designing the country program, with project managers of OTI and its grantees;

•	Serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department to ensure program and policy direction;

•	Within the guidelines provided by the relevant OTI/Washington Team Leader, negotiate program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for: identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country’s political process.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates, the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the “bullpen”, serving on intermittent/part-time contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.

This Scope of Work is Washington, D.C.–based, for those individuals who will be available to work with OTI for short or extended periods of time in Washington, D.C. and the field performing a range of duties outlined in the “Duties and Responsibilities” sections below. Work assignments will range in length depending on the needs of OTI, and availability of the individuals selected for the position(s).  

The Senior Program Advisors are a critical element of OTI’s success in providing fast and flexible responses to key transition needs. The incumbents must possess the program, project management and budgetary skills to help ensure successful start-ups, management, and close-outs of OTI country programs. The complex demands of the position require that the incumbents be readily available for both Washington and field assignments. The Washington assignments many times require immediate response to lengthy and critical tasks and this makes it important that personnel be based in the Washington area. 

The worldwide nature of the OTI program requires Senior Program Advisors who can immediately respond to the challenging and complex demands of OTI projects. The proper execution of OTI programs requires individuals with a high level of managerial and operational skills who are readily available to report for duty in either Washington or field assignments or a combination of both.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this solicitation is to provide on-call senior level program specialist capabilities to the OTI Bullpen.

The incumbent will visit, as necessary, a wide range of ongoing OTI projects as well as proposed and potential country program sites.

In new country programs, the Senior Program Advisor will:

•	Assess the feasibility of the country as a potential candidate for an OTI program;

•	Conceptualize and design the country program, with project managers of OTI and its grantees;

•	Serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department to ensure program and policy direction;

•	Within the guidelines provided by the OTI/Washington Team Leader, negotiate program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;

•	Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;

•	Implement and manage the assigned country program in the absence of the country rep in the field, or team leader/program manager in Washington, including assessing project sites and selecting contractor and grantees to work under OTI's country program;

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>The Pre-Solicitation Conference, held at the USAF Academy on 5 Jun 2008, resulted in several questions that were submitted by potential offerors.  The following are responses to those questions.
 

1.  Flight instructors are required in the SOW, Para 1.2.1, however, it does not indicate who will provide the training for those personnel.  Please clarify who will train the Air Force instructor pilots, or is the contractor required to develop and implement this training program?

Answer (#1): The Air Force will train the AF instructor pilots.

2.  With the aircraft designation as a Public Use entity described in the SOW, Para 1.2.5.1, will the Air Force instructors have, or require any civilian rating, such as CFI?

Answer (#2): The AF IPs will not be required to have a CFI.

3.  Record keeping will be required for the AF instructor pilots, i.e., documentation of flight time, check rides, currency, etc., however, we could not determine who will administer or track and document those requirements?  Please clarify. 

Answer (#3): The AF will administer, track and document those requirements for its instructors.

4.  Will the contractor be responsible for Functional Check Flights and other maintenance related flights, or does the government accomplish those requirements? 

Answer (#4): The government will conduct check/flight test requirements required by CFR, Title 14. See Par 1.2.5.5 

5.  The aircraft being considered will fit into government provided hangars, although the clearance will be close to the door jambs.  May we paint zebra stripes (yellow & black) caution markings on the side of the hangar doors to make personnel aware of those close tolerance while moving aircraft?

Answer (#5):  This can be coordinated with 10th CES and 306 FTG

6.  SOW Para 1.2.2.2 - Do the flying periods overlap or can a single airplane be used for all flying periods?

Answer (#6): The flying periods during the academic year do not overlap.  The flying periods during the summer period may overlap.

7.  Will additional flying periods for IP training overlap with the student flying periods so as to require additional airplanes?

Answer (#7): Please see the answer to #6.

8.   Para 1.1.2 of the SOW describes the sorties/hours of flight instruction.  Is there a cap of 15 sorties per flying period for the fall or spring semester?

Answer (#8): There is not a specific limit.

9.  Is there a cap of 16 sorties per flying period for the summer?

Answer (#9): There is not a specific limit.

10.  Same rationale as item 8 and 9.  SOW Para 1.2.2.5 - What is the cap on additional scheduled sorties per flying period?

Answer (#10): There is not a specific limit.

11.  Reference the SOW, Para 1.2.5.4 - Will the contractor be required to log flying times or will the government log flying times and then report them to the contractor for maintenance purposes?  If the government provides the flying times, how soon after the flight will they be reported to the contractor?

Answer (#11): The AF IPs will log time for their documentation purposes and can provide the flight time when signing-in from the flight.

12.  SOW Para 1.2.5.4 - Does the specific documentation training on AFTO Form 781 series forms involve travel?

Answer (#12): No

13.   SOW Para 1.2.6.2.1 - Is the contractor required to move the airplanes out of the hangars at the beginning of the flying day or during the day if required for any flying period?

Answer (#13): Yes

14.  Para 1.2.6.2.3 of the SOW - Does the requirement for the contractor to move, chock, and moor all aircraft left attended on the flight-line refer only to airplanes repositioned between the ramp and maintenance?  I.e., is the contractor responsible to move all aircraft and chock and moor every airplane after every flight?

Answer (#14): Depends on the weather conditions, but the contractor is responsible for the safety of the airplanes.

15.  Para 1.2.9.3 - What are the approved and/or prohibited methods for removing ice from the tie downs?

Answer (#15): A hammer and chisel may be used to break existing ice to attaché tie downs.

16.  SOW Para 3.2.1 - Is there a hazard identified with the weight of the center post of four newer hangar doors, or what drives the requirement for 2 people to move the post?  Is there a schedule for replacing the older existing hangar doors with the newer door and heavier center post?

Answer (#16): Center post removal may require two personnel to remove depending on strength of the individual but is not the norm.  No schedule is in place to replace the older doors.

17.  Is there a hazard identified with the formation and persistence of ice in front of the maintenance hangar, building 9218?

Answer (#17): Ice formation and persistence in the front of the mx bays is a recognized condition and caution should be exercised by the contractor when moving aircraft in and out of the mx bays.   

18.  SOW Para 3.2.2.5 - What are the dimensions and weight of the survival kit?  Will the government provide the survival kits?

Answer (#18): Dimensions are 14" x 14" and weight is 18-23 lbs The government will provide the survival kits.

19.  What is the purpose of the four handheld VHF radios that are described for contractor use in Para 3.3.4.2 of the SOW?

Answer (#19): Radios are provided by the 557 FTS for maintenance to communicate with operations as desired.

20.  During the site visit, there appeared to be some deterioration on the ramp that will be used for PFP.  Although Para 3.3.7 of the SOW addresses Snow removal and FOD, are there any procedures to have the ramp repaired, or what recourse does the contractor have if aircraft or propellers are damaged by ramp conditions?

Answer (#20): Ramp deterioration can be reported to civil engineering for repair as needed.  A claim for suspected aircraft/propeller damage can be submitted to the legal office for consideration.

21.  Since the PFP program was recently directed to be a Small Business Set Aside, will consideration be given to using resumes for past performance, and if a small business teams with a large business, will they be able to use the past performance of the large business?

Answer (#21): Factor 2 – Past and Present Performance, will be evaluated based on relevancy and recency of past performance.

22.  Talon Software:  Does the 557th/306th use the Talon software system for scheduling/dispatch?  If so, are they going to cover the additional fees for the PFP students and the Contractor merely supplies Schedulers/dispatchers to manage the program?  Or is the Contractor expected to cover that expense?

Answer (#22): Patriot Excalibur software is used by the 557 FTS.  The contractor is not required to conduct operations scheduling or dispatch.

22a.  If the Contractor-supplies Schedulers/Flight Dispatchers, will they be able to reside at the 557th Ops Desk for duty location?  Or is this a government-supplied service?  

Answer (#22a): There is no requirement for the contractor to provide these services. The government will provide these services. 

 
23.  Is the AETC adamant about 100% Blue-suit flight instructors?  A small contingent of Contractor IPs can help by teaching ground courses, providing back-up should an attached IP get hung up on the Hill, continuity with the normal PCS rotation and POC for any flight manual changes by the manufacturer.  This model worked very well at Hondo & USAFA and answers some of the concerns that the 1998 Broad Area Review had regarding USAFA manning and experience in light aircraft instruction.

Answer (#23): The AF intends to only use AF instructors.
 
24.  If the contractor offers, what paint scheme would AETC/USAFA desire?

Answer (#24): There is no requirement for the contractor to provide aircraft with a unique paint scheme.
 
25.  Once the contract is awarded, will the Air Force allow personnel access to the facilities before 1 Oct?

Answer (#25): Permission to access the facilities will be AFTER contract award. 
 
26.  Is there a plan/allowance for the Program/Site Manager to reside in the 557th building or is the Contractor expected to house all personnel in the Hangars?

Answer (#26): All contractor personnel will be housed in the hangars.

<DESC><p>The Air Armament Center, 708th Armament Systems Group, Eglin AFB FL, is seeking sources to continue the existing acquisition strategy for the follow on production of the FMU-152A/B Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) for the remaining quantity of 28,174 systems. If any potential offeror feels they can meet the requirements outlined below, they should deliver a Statement of Capabilities in accordance with Numbered Note 25 specifically defining their capabilities.<br />The JPF is a multifunction, multi-delay tail fuze system with hardened target capability for use in general purpose and penetrating unitary warheads. The JPF operates with a wide variety of guidance kits, high and low drag fins, and with all configurations of the DSU-33 proximity sensor to provide an airburst capability. When used with the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), the JPF operating mode and other settings may be selected in flight from the cockpit through a serial RS-422 interface between the weapon and fuze. The objectives of JPF production lots are to fabricate a high quality JPF that is fully integrated and qualified for employment. The following delivery schedule must be met or exceeded; Contract Award - NLT 1st quarter FY09, first delivery of fully qualified production units - NLT May 2010. A total quantity of 28,174 systems is required with an estimated&nbsp;budget of $29.7M in FY09 and and annual estimated budget of $40.0M in FY10 through FY13.<br />Potential offerors would be required to provide a fully qualified JPF that is compatible with the Mark 80 series (MK-82, MK-83, MK-84) and penetrator warheads (BLU-109, BLU-110, BLU-113, BLU-122). It must also be compatible for use in all JDAM variants, AGM-130, and GBU-10/12/15/16/24/27/28 weapon systems as well as in the basic "dumb" bomb configurations. In addition to weapons compatibility, the JPF must be qualified and certified on the following aircraft: B-1B, B-2A, B-52H, F-15E, F-16C/D, F-22, A-10. The contractor must also have adequate resources to provide engineering and testing support for emerging aircraft integration requirements. The current budget only supports the production of FMU-152A/B JPF systems. As a result, the Government considers system maturity to be the top priority, and therefore, offerors must be prepared to begin full rate production by May 2010. The contractor must also have the capacity to produce at a rate of 1,800 systems per month for the duration. Full qualification and integration testing costs, including a First Article Acceptance Test (FAAT) program, would be the total responsibility of the contractor. The contractor must provide shipping to CONUS locations and also provide adequate production, test and logistics (warranty) support. The contractor must meet the system specifications for both the FMU-152A/B and FZU-55A/B fuze bomb initiator. The system specifications for each may be obtained by contacting the Contract Specialist, Ms. Lisa Younghanse, at (850) 882-8787 ext. 3100. <br />This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not the Government's intention to pay for information solicited at this time. Direct all questions and routine communications concerning this acquisition to Ms. Lisa Younghanse, (850) 882-8787 ext 3100. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to appropriate Government personnel. When required, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the POCs listed below. For any other concerns, interested parties may call the AAC Ombudsman, Colonel Arnold W. Bunch, Jr. at (850) 882-0662.<br />For further information, contact the Contract Specialist, Mrs. Lisa Younghanse, 679 ARSS, (850) 882-8787, Ext. 3100. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute an invitation for bid or a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. No costs will be paid for any charges incurred in responding to this synopsis. Information submitted should be addressed to 679 ARSS, Attn: Mrs. Lisa Younghanse, 110 Wacissa Road, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6864. See note 25.</p>

6/4/08
TITLE: B-2 Training System Final RFP Release
DESCRIPTION:  The FINAL RFP has been posted below.  All interested parties are reminded that the contracting officer is the sole focal point of any exchange with potential offerors. Should questions pertaining to this acquisition be directed to your organization by other than the Source Selection Authority or the Source Selection Team, the inquiry should be directed to Betty W. Clingerman at (937)255-2679 or Betty.Clingerman@wpafb.af.mil. The Source Selection Authority is the only person with authority to release information regarding an ongoing source selection.
DEADLINESThe Past Performance Volume must be received by 19 June 2008, by 1500 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT).  The rest of the proposal must be received by 22 July 2008, by 1500 EDT.


************************************************************************************5/15/08
TITLE: B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RFP - FINAL REVIEW
DESCRIPTION: The B-2 Training System RFP is in Final Review.  The B-2 Training System team intends to release the Final RFP, once Business Clearance is approved.  This notice of contract action is required to satisfy FAR 5.2 Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, specifically 5.203 Publicizing and Response Time.
PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.

************************************************************************************5/12/08
TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

Contracting questions to Kimberly Miles, 301-504-7018, kmiles@cpsc.gov.  INTRODUCTION:  The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) staff is seeking information from the scientific community, health and safety professionals, academia, consumer groups, industry representatives, voluntary standards associations and the general public about approaches for enhancing quantitative measures of the safety of consumer products. Enhancements should be both meaningful and practical. The agency is also seeking information about how to implement a cost-effective system to collect and analyze data to be able to produce these enhanced measures.  BACKGROUND:  CPSC is an independent regulatory agency, established in 1973, with jurisdiction over thousands of products used by consumers in and around homes.  The agency administers five laws as follows: •Consumer Product Safety Act •Federal Hazardous Substances Act •Flammable Fabrics Act •Poison Prevention Packaging Act and the  •Refrigerator Safety Act.  Under these laws, the agency recalls unsafe products, establishes mandatory standards for certain products, participates in the voluntary standards development process for certain products, conducts information and education campaigns about product safety, and tests consumer products for compliance with laws and standards.  The agency bases its actions to reduce the risks from hazardous consumer products on information developed from its extensive data collection systems that are used to assess the causes, frequency, and severity of consumer product-related injuries.  In the late 1980s CPSC staff developed a Comprehensive Plan to determine compliance rates for a variety of regulated products (i.e., consumer products directly subject to the law).  The Comprehensive Plan was designed to examine the compliance of these products on a periodic basis, and then identify problem areas so as to focus agency resources on these areas.  The Plan involved prioritizing a number of product categories and then scheduling studies in the categories considered to be of high priority.  The model for prioritization contained factors involving the hazard, the specific industry, and previous compliance history in the product category.  A number of studies were then conducted.  Common factors in these studies included the following: •Selection of a product or class of products for study •The development of a frame for sampling retail stores, manufacturers, wholesalers, or importers (collectively:  establishments), as required by a particular study •Selection of a sample of establishments from the frame  •Visits to establishments and testing of study consumer products on-site or at the CPSC Engineering Laboratory •Estimation of the proportion of complying and non-complying products sold in the U.S. for the product under study.   Some examples of studies carried out under the Comprehensive Plan, with the associated mandatory standard in parenthesis were as follows:  •A 1994 survey on adult sleepwear to determine compliance with regulations on the flammability of clothing textiles (16 CFR 1610). •A 1994 study to evaluate compliance with the bicycle standard (16 CFR 1512).  For the most part, these studies were very labor intensive, requiring travel by agency field staff to different parts of the country and occasionally resulting in expensive product testing.  These studies did not continue after the mid 1990s because it was believed that agency resources would be more appropriately targeted on emerging hazardous products, or products that were suspected of being defective or non-compliant with voluntary or mandatory standards.  In addition, it appeared from the Comprehensive Plan studies, injury surveillance, and other studies that overall compliance with agency regulations was high.  However, one problem with targeting resources toward certain potentially hazards products is that if successfully targeted, compliance rates will be low and unrepresentative of the entire product population in that product category.  Thus it is difficult, if not impossible, to estimate safety metrics for all products within a particular category if the sample is selected to target the most hazardous or most non-compliant products in that category.  REQUEST:  CPSC staff would like to build on the knowledge gained from previous studies, information in various existing surveillance systems and other knowledge-based systems to develop cost effective, enhanced metrics of consumer product safety.  As well as an overall metric or metrics of product safety, agency staff would like metrics associated with vulnerable subpopulations, such as children under 6 and adults over 65.  Metrics could also be classified by types of activities, such as sports and recreation, cooking, or day care; or to specific product groups, such as home heating equipment, children’s jewelry (lead hazard), or bicycles.   These are presented as examples and should not be understood to represent the only activities or products of interest.  Agency staff is particularly interested in metrics associated with two agency strategic goals.  These are as follows: •Fire Hazards:  Reduce the rate of death from fire-related causes by 20 percent from 1998 to 2013. •Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Hazard:  Reduce the rate of death from CO poisoning by 20 percent from the 1999-2000 average by the year 2013.  Also, a major agency focus is on reducing injuries and deaths associated with hazards to children from consumer products, especially imported products.  For more details on agency activities and goals, see the 2008 Performance Budget (Operating Plan), available from the agency on request or at http://www.cpsc.gov/.  GENERAL QUESTIONS: To summarize, agency staff is looking for a general approach that would result in the following: 1. A planned approach involving both agency staff and stakeholders that would lead to enhanced and credible metrics of consumer product-related safety.  2. Investigation of various data sources to augment current surveillance system data that would be used in such a system to estimate the measures.  3. How such data would be analyzed to produce the required metrics.
4. Approximate costs for development and operation of a system to provide these metrics.
The agency is also interested in the capability of respondents to develop and operate such a system.  In addressing the general questions above the respondent should provide some detailed information about the following: 1. The process of identifying stakeholders.
2. Approaches to involve stakeholders at the beginning and during the process.
3. Technical approaches leading to the development of a credible, cost-efficient and useful measure(s) of product safety.  4.  Some product safety measures that might be used in such a study along with the appropriate denominators reflecting exposure.  5.  Experiences of other regulatory agencies and experiences of the respondent with this type of project.
6.  The use and/or adaptation of CPSC agency data sources and available non-agency data, e.g., health surveys, insurance data, etc. in these metrics. 7.

<DESC><h1>SYNOPSIS MODIFICATION</h1> --The purpose of this synopsis modification is to provide clarifications regarding prior synopsis modifications.<br><br>

--- <h2>CLARIFICATIONS</h2>  <br><br>

If there are conflicts between answers to questions and other information, the answers and information provided in later synopsis modifications will take precedence over answers and information provided in earlier synopsis modifications.  For example, answers to question 6 and question 7 addressed order discounts and pricing.  Portions of those answers are superseded because they are further addressed or clarified in subsequent synopsis modifications.  Specifically, the answer to question 6 states that “discounts will NOT be considered in the evaluation of proposals”.  With the subsequent incorporation of the option to propose a discount strategy by adding paragraph L.3.7.k. and the discount strategy evaluation factor in Section M – Step 1, this statement is no longer true.  Discounts will be considered by evaluating the Discount Strategy as part of the technical evaluation scoring.  Similarly, in answer 7 it reads “only the total price will be used in the best value award determination.”  This sentence remains true with specific reference to the prices; however, the addition of the Discount Strategy and the Price Adjustment Strategy make it clear that these strategies will be considered in the best value award determination, but as part of the technical evaluation scoring and not the offered price.<br><br>

Additionally, answers to questions that affect the proposal instructions or terms of the solicitation and contract, even though, inadvertently, they were not specifically incorporated into the solicitation, should be treated as if they were incorporated by reference.  Specifically, the requirement to use the adhesive specified in the answer to question 12 and the answer to question 21 regarding material requirements, all for proposal purposes only, to ensure consistent pricing, are incorporated into Section L by reference even though such incorporation was not specifically stated in the answers to these questions.

Potential Offerors are hereby notified that the following changes are made: Theoriginal description previously posted is deleted in its entirety and replaced with thefollowing:NASA/JSC has a requirement for NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office (ODPO) to carry outits optical measurement research program on the Michigan Orbital Debris Survey Telescope(MODEST).  The telescope is located at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO)in Chile.  Photometric light curves from MODEST and the ODPO optical measurementlaboratory are continually being analyzed along with the results from the spectroscopicdata to determine the material type and shape of debris.The due date for responses has not been extended.Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  Thesedocuments will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWWbrowser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/JSC Business Opportunitieshome page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73     Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation andany amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy ofthe solicitation and amendments (if any).NASA/JSC intends to purchase the required research from Boeing, LTS, Inc. Boeing, LTS has demonstrated the technical expertise and computer modeling skillsnecessary to analyze the time variable orbits of high Amperes per Meter (A/m) objects.Boeing, LTS has been NASAs liaison with the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) to combinemetric observations from MODEST and AFSPC and to provide predictive positions needed forfuture observations of high A/m targets.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Tufts University, 711 Washington Street, Boston, MA 02111 services regarding the evaluation of iron levels and the risk of upper gastrointestinal cancers in the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Cancer Prevention Study.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR 13.106-(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.5M.</p>
<p>Period of performance: Performance shall be for one year from date of award.</p>
<p>The Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Group (http://dceg.cancer.gov/neb/research/ugcrg), based in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, conducts intramural research which predominantly focuses on nutritional exposures that may mediate risk of specific UGI malignancies, such as gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.  The ultimate goal is to identify exposures that can be modified in order to reduce human cancer risk.</p>
<p>The overall purpose of this study is to study the association of serum ferritin and serum transferrin saturation with the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, adjusting for the likely confounding variable of inflammation (CRP).</p>
<p>The contractor shall do the following:</p>
<p>1.   Measure serum ferritin using an immunoradiometric assay (Count-A-Count Ferritin IRMA: Diagnostic Products Los Angeles, CA) for each and every individual sample.</p>
<p>2.  Measure serum iron and unsaturated iron binding capacity using a standard ferrozine-based iron colormetric assay (Olympus AU 400e auto analyzer) for each and every individual sample.<br /> <br />3.  Measure CRP levels using a latex particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay kit (KASSAY CRP Ultra (Equal Diagnostics, Exton, PA)) for each and every individual sample.</p>
<p>The contractor shall do the above-mentioned analyses on all 82 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 257 gastric cancer, 339 matched control and 76 quality control samples.</p>
<p>An earlier analysis of serum ferritin, serum iron, unsaturated iron-binding capacity and CRP in a case-control study of colon cancer (Cross et al. 2006), also nested in the ATBC Cancer Prevention Study, used Dr. Wood's laboratory at Tufts University for its analytical measurements.  The NCI will compare our results with the results of this previous study, to compare the effects of iron status on cancers of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.  It is essential that the analyses be performed in the same laboratory. The laboratory of Tufts University is one of the few laboratories that can undertake such analyses with a high level of confidence, which has led to their international reputation for high quality mineral assessment.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on June 30, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80077-MM on all correspondence.</p>

The ACFO-FS accomplishes this by maintaining the corporate financial management system, the Foundation Financial Information System, corporate reporting through the Financial Statement Data Warehouse, agency reporting thorough the Financial Data Warehouse, an Automated Cash Reconciliation Work Sheet used for daily reconciliation with the United States Treasury, the Purchase Card Management System, the Travel System, the Personal Property System, and the Purchase Order System.

MPC data serve as an imputation source for item non response to reduce the level of bias in survey estimates of medical expenditures. It also serves as a souce of expenditure information on physicial charges that are associated with hospital care but not billed by the hospital as well as serving the primary source of expenditure information for Medicaid recipients and prescribed medicines.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) has a requirement for capabilities and facilities to establish and manage a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) to support NIAID sponsored clinical research programs in allergy/asthma, autoimmune, and transplant-related diseases.   
		   Description 
The Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to recompete a requirement for capabilities and facilities to establish and manage a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) to support NIAID sponsored clinical research programs in allergy/asthma, autoimmune, and transplant-related diseases.   

The Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) was established in 1999 and is currently under a contract to the University of California, San Francisco.  The overall goal of the ITN is to accelerate the evaluation of promising approaches for the induction and maintenance of immune tolerance in four clinical areas: solid organ transplantation, islet cell transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and asthma and allergic diseases.  

The Contractor shall serve as the SDCC for clinical and non-clinical research activities carried out by the ITN with the responsibility for a broad range of support functions, including: statistical design and analysis; clinical data collection, storage, management, quality control, reporting and associated training for clinical site personnel; safety oversight; preparation of study-related materials; and clinical study website development and maintenance. 

(Note: Although the ITN generates both clinical and mechanistic data from each trial, the scope of SDCC statistical functions is limited only to clinical data as specified in each protocol.  Statistical design and analysis of mechanistic data and combined data from both clinical trials and mechanistic studies will be performed collaboratively by the ITN Clinical Trials Group and the ITN Bioinformatics Group).

The contract will be funded for a base period of six (6) years to provide SDCC support for the research activities of the ITN.
