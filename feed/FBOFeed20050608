<DESC>The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS), solicits CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS for the study entitled "EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FROM SUBSEA PROCESSING."  The MMS is a bureau within the U. S. Department of the Interior, which has jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf, Public Law 103-426, enacted October 31, 1994.  The NAICS code is for this procurement is 541710, with a size standard of 500 employees.  INTRODUCTION:  Production of oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) faces new challenges as the industry moves into deeper water.  The cost of exploration and operation in deep water (over 1000 ft.) is much higher than on shallower portions of the continental shelf.  New technologies are required to meet the demands of greater depths.  The equipment and structures used are far above the seafloor.  Besides the requirement for stronger structural integrity for equipment reaching the seafloor, the forces required to lift the product to the surface are greater.  Installing and maintaining a platform in deep water is a costly proposition and can suffer from catastrophic events such as hurricanes.  Processing oil and gas at the seafloor can eliminate some of the risks and expenses of operating in deep water.  Subsea processing involves a large template and a variety of equipment placed on the seafloor.  The technology of subsea processing can remove the need for a seasurface structure or can allow extraction from numerous wells to be combined to one platform with unlimited tie-back distance.  It reduces the problems of hydrate formation by removing water before transporting through lines at near freezing temperatures on the deep seafloor.  This can also eliminate the necessity for hydrate inhibitors.  Water is then re-injected to a well.  Removal of water before transport also increases efficiency by reducing the weight and maximizing the capacity of pipelines.  Gas can also be re-injected instead of flaring.  Subsea processing would be a new technology in the Gulf of Mexico and the potential environmental impacts from this type of process need to be evaluated.  The Technical Assessment and Research group of the Minerals Management Service has recently assessed the risks of subsea processing as compared to surface processing.  The study included the possibility of component failures, which could lead to a potential spill.  The technical report is available at http://www.mms.gov/tarprojects/500/Report%2070003245%20Rev%202.pdf.  SCOPE OF WORK:  This currently proposed study will look further to the potential environmental impacts from such a failure.  This project is designed to gather all relevant information for evaluating the possible environmental effects related to subsea processing.  The intent is to gather all the information available, make logical deductions from that information, and determine information needs concerning possible impacts that we cannot clearly predict.  OBJECTIVES:  The objectives of this project are: (1) review and synthesize information about the technology of subsea processing, including future trends; (2) review and synthesize all studies conducted on the potential environmental impacts of subsea processing; (3) review and synthesize information on platform processes that could possibly be moved to the seafloor in the future and the environmental issues and potential environmental impacts; (4) evaluate potential environmental impacts of all aspects of subsea processing and potential accidents associated with subsea processing in the Gulf of Mexico.  (Extrapolate from known processing effects as necessary); and (5) identify data gaps, information needs, and questions that should be answered.  The period of performance of this study shall be twelve (12) months, including the completion of all deliverables, with an estimated cost between $75,000 and $99,999.  The study area is the entire Gulf of Mexico out to the extent of the U.S. exclusive economic zone.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Centerplate/NBSE, Washington Convention Center, Washington, DC 20001, pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This request is for food and beverage services for approx. 400 people for a 2 day conference "Environmental Solutions to Obesity in Americas Youth", June 1-2, 2005, being held at the Washington Convention Center.  The Washington Convention Center has a designated service organization which supplies catering services for events held at its facility and will not permit outside entities to supply food and beverages for planned events.  As a consequence no other source has the ability to provide food and beverage services for the NIEHS conference.  Any firm believing itself capable of providing these catering services may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 7 days of date of notice to Dee Lunney at the above address for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 7 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Centerplate/NBSE.  The NAICS Code/Size is 722310/$17.5M..  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition threshold of $100,000.  Market research into convention center services for conferences similar in nature has shown that the practice of a convention center providing the catering services using a designated provider for events held at their facility is standard practice in the industry.  There is no solicitation package available.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.*****

This additional equipment is 100% compatible with existing Vemco equipment, data analysis software, and Access database systems that are currently owned and used by the NEFSC.  In addition, this equipment will be used collaboratively with Canadian scientists in Department of Fisheries and Oceans and Atlantic Salmon Federation, and the University of Maine Orono/USGS as part of an integrated international monitoring system which increases the need for standardization.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to provide comparable and compatible equipment by June 16, 2005.

<DESC>MARTIN'S DRAW STEWARDSHIP DESCRIPTION Martin's Draw is located in the southern part of the Big Horn Mountain Range, 13 miles northeast of Kaycee, Wyoming.  This 17 acre stand of Ponderosa pine is declining due to the lack of health and vigor of the trees.  These characteristics accompany an overmature stand and have, as a result, contributed to the decline of this stand and is an area of high fuel loads.  Historically, fires have provided a method of controlling and contributing to the health and vigor of these forest stands by providing the silvicutultural treatments of thinning and natural selection of the most vigorous and healthy trees. However, this pattern of selection has been interrupted by fire control and suppression. The prescription involves selecting and marking 10-20 seed trees per acre. These trees will be selected for genetic components desirable for regeneration and the two components of; abundant seed production and tree location.  The remainder of the Ponderosa pines would be harvested (3,000-6,000 BF per acre) and all logging slash placed into piles for burning (burning to be performed by BLM).  There are areas of overstocking of Ponderosa pine seedlings produced by natural regeneration on this stand.  Thinning of these seedlings and saplings will be incorporated into the fuel hazard reduction for this stand.  Douglas fir seedlings and saplings will be the exceptions.  This species will be considered the most desirable, and the trees will be marked to remain and eventually be the dominant species in the climax stage of this forest. Wyoming sawmills has completed extensive construction on the road system into and around this area. BENEFITS Several goals and objectives would be achieved in performing these management tasks.  There would be a reduction in the fuel loads on this site.  Though these fuels would be diminished, the ecological integrity of the stand would remain intact by providing a source of regeneration and maintaining the current stage of the seral regeneration (Douglas fir).  Also, the competition would be reduced to allow for the development of healthy trees with adequate growing space. Leaving the seed trees would maintain the natural landscape pattern on Gardner mountain. The wood products would provide a resource for the local sawmill and the adjacent landowner. The landowner has in the past, had agreements with the BLM to remove wood products from this area.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award a sole source contract to the City of Norfolk, Virginia for the continuation of layberthing services for the ex-WISCONSIN Battleship at the layberthing site for the ship located in Norfolk, Virginia.  The contract will consist of a base year plus options for an additional four years of layberthing services.  A considerable investment of time and money was made to develop the ship’s layberthing site and it is not practical or cost effective for the ship to be moved to another location.  Therefore, the City of Norfolk, Virginia is deemed the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Government’s requirements.  Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact the City of Norfolk, Virginia directly as follows:  Office of Purchasing, Room 607 City Hall, 810 Union Street, Norfolk, VA 23510.

<DESC>The Office of Justice Programs(OJP), National Institute of Justice (NIJ) attends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to the Northwest Professional Consortium (NPC), 4380 SW Macadam Ave., Suite 530, Portland, OR 97239-6408.  The NPC will conduct for NIJ a study on Drug Court Evaluation Efforts.  The NPC has collected for many years an extensive database combining administrative data from several sources, including police, public defenders, treatment providers, and various judicial information systems. In obtaining this information from the NPC  it affords NIJ with an  excellent opportunity to examine on a year by year basis the effectiveness of drug courts in relation to a number of changes in policies, procedures and judges over the 10-year period which in turn will provide considerable insights as to what factors in drug courts impact the success of drug court participants, as well as to look at the matched sample for each period.  Given the reputation, credibility, and past success of the NPC in addressing the topic of drug court research no other source for performing this work could bring an equivalent level of expertise to this proposed task. The aggregate data set created by NPC Research and the information from the Prosecutor’s Office will aid the National Institute of Justice with preparing the necessary reports and research papers to information other program offices and agencies of the findings.  The Government considers the information presented at this conference to be valuable to NIJ’s mission to provide accurate and updated information to its customers.  This order will be negotiated in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 2151(c)(1) Only one responsible source with unique capabilities.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.

<DESC>Subject to final approval, the Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center  intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Porras Ruiz Brown and Company for a seven month period. The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) requires a sole source contract with Porras Ruiz Brown and Company  for this project.  They are the only qualified entity that can carry out the multiple tasks described herein. 

(1)	The scope of this contract and the audits to be conducted in country will be in conformity with the Audit Manual for Use by Independent Auditors in the Examination of Foundation Grants (version 2004) or Audit Manual, provided as Addendum 1, to this Statement of Work. Audits performed under this contract will include, in part, a review of the grantee’s books and records to determine whether the grantee is in compliance with the requirements as set forth in the grant agreement executed between the Foundation and the grantee, and to render an opinion on the results of the audit.

(2)	The audit will include a review of grantee’s use of grant funds as well as its receipt of counterpart resources, in the context of the grant agreement. The audit will require the auditor to review, evaluate, and analyze actual incurred costs and compare the costs with budgeted and proposed line items. Included in the audit report shall be a comparative analysis between the actual incurred costs (the disbursed budgeted amount) and the overall total budgeted amount. Included with the analysis is a narrative on any significant variances and/or issues.

(3) 	The audit reports shall be submitted to the Foundation as an e-mail attachment. All audit reports shall be submitted in Spanish.

The form, content and timing of submission of the audit report shall be in accordance with the criteria specified by the Audit Manual established by the Foundation. 

The Porras, Ruiz, Brown & Co. audit firm is the incumbent contractor currently providing audit services to the IAF in Nicaragua.  The IAF has a need to continue receiving Porras, Ruiz, Brown & Co.’s audit services in Nicaragua to avoid a break in audit services until a new five-year competitive contract is awarded. Grant audits are an essential element of the decision making process related to grant disbursements and a critical component of the monitoring program. IAF needs to award a sole source contract to a qualified auditor to perform these audits for the remainder of the existing contract period.  Porras, Ruiz, Brown & Co. has an audit process in place that can quickly and expeditiously accommodate the IAF’s needs without having to set up a costly or time-consuming infrastructure; once Porras, Ruiz, Brown & Co. receives the purchase order, they can immediately carry out the required tasks.

There is no current Foundation Auditor in place who would be available to conduct a search and interviews and provide adequate orientation for a new contractor.


 NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  Public Debt-Administrative Resource Center will consider all affirmative responses received no later than June 24, 2005.  Affirmative responses shall reference TPD IAF 05 00025 and shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required services or functional equivalent at terms more advantageous to the Government.  Requests for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.  If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be awarded to Porras Ruiz Brown and Company.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Army Communications Electronic Command (CECOM) intends to modify Firm-Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contracts DAAB07-02-D-A217 & DAAB07-02-D-A219 in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, One Responsible Source, to incr ease the ordering ceiling on each of the BA-5372/U battery contracts from 384,840 packages to 885,000 packages.  SAFT America (SAFT) and Ultralife Batteries, Inc. (UBI) are the only known sources for this battery configuration.   The BA-5372/U is a small, lightweight battery that provides high power outputs over a wide temperature range.  It is used as a memory hold battery in various strategic and tactical communications-electronics systems.  It provides memory back up power to ov er 60 end items in the Army inventory, including a wide variety of tactical and strategic communications-electronics equipment, the most notable being the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System.  All of these end items are essential to the Armys ability to successfully accomplish its battlefield missions.  The UBI and SAFT contracts were awarded prior to the onset of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF).  As a result of missions associated with OEF/OIF, demands for the BA-5372/U battery have increased significantly over the originally projected demands.  The remaining quantity of batteries that can be ordered on these contracts, based on the current contract ordering ceilings, is insufficient to meet the projected near term demands.  Additional batteries are needed to eliminate backorders and replenish inventory to authorized levels.  Quantities will be added, but the terms of the contracts will remain unchanged.  The cumulative estimated price of the proposed action is $65.8M. The National Stock Number is 6135-01-214-6441.  Shipments are to be FOB Origin with Inspection/Acceptance at Contractor Facility.  Packaging and delivery schedule will be as specified in the ensuing delivery orders.  This is a modification to Contracts DAA B07-02-D-A217 & DAAB07-02-D-A219 and the solicitation numbers assigned are W15P7T-05-R-C047 and W15P7T-05-R-C048.   The US Army CECOM has established the IBOP website as part of the Armys Single Face to Industry, to allow electronic posting of Solicitation for Request for Proposals (RFPs), Request for Quotations (RFQs), and Invitations for Bids (IFBs) from CECOM to industry.  All parties interested in doing business with CECOM are invited to access, operate, send and receive information from the IBOP at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/ All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service (USPS) is conducting this prequalification solicitation in an attempt to identify the suppliers that will compete for future Designated Fuel Supplier (DFS) contracts across the United States.  A DFS is generally defined as a refiner, wholesale marketer, super jobber or any qualified petroleum company authorized and properly licensed to sell or resell refined petroleum products throughout the continental United States.  Tanks in this program are owned by independent USPS contractors, and range in capacity from 500 to greater than 10,000 gallons.  They are situated both above and underground; many have the ability to accept truckload deliveries, however some require special accommodations such as pump trucks to receive fuel. (While preference will be given to suppliers that can provide fuel in less than truckload quantities as required, they will not be disqualified on this basis.) Fuel may also be required to be provided FOB the respective terminal storage loading facility in full petroleum tank loads, minimum 7000-7500 gallons of diesel fuel. The Postal Service is primarily interested in prequalifying suppliers with existing operations that can provide or be modified to provide the products and services described in this document.  Suppliers who meet the prequalification criteria will be those who have demonstrated their ability to perform consistently to high standards of quality and reliability.

Solicitations requiring a prequalified supplier will be advertised only to suppliers on the prequalification list.  The Postal Service policy requires adequate competition and reserves the right to advertise such solicitations to all or a portion of the prequalified suppliers.   Future solicitations may be published only to those suppliers on the prequalified list.  However, being listed as a prequalified supplier does not guarantee that a supplier will be awarded a future contract.  In addition, the Postal Service reserves the right to use non-prequalified suppliers when circumstances dictate this to be an appropriate action that is in the best business interests of the Postal Service.

<DESC>Update 8 June 2005, 1600  This update reopens the XR_SIMAF Software and Hardware combined  synopsis_solicitation announcement due to two significant omissions in the  original synoptization, posted 24 May 2005. The Contracting Officer has  determined that the 24 May 05 announcement did not comply with FAR 13.106_1(a) (2) in that the Basis for Award was not clearly stated and a new DOD mandated  clause, DFARS 252.211_7003, Unit Identification  and Valuation, was  erroneously omitted. The XR_SIMAF Software and Computer Hardware is reopened  and firms may withdraw or revise previously submitted proposals/quotes or  submit new firm fixed price proposals/quotes until 4:00 pm EST on June 15,  2005. The following language is added to the original synoptization to clarify  these issues: Basis for Award: This will be a best value award.  The Government will determine the proposal  that provides the most advantageous offer to satisfy the requirements of this  RFQ based on an integrated assessment of each quotation.  Selection will be  based on consideration of: (1) the technical capability of the items offered  to meet the Government requirement; (2) past performance; and (3) price.   Unit Identification and Valuation: The new OSD requirement for UID and Valuation of all items delivered to OSD,  i.e. components with unit values more than $5,000 require the clasue DFARS  252.211_7003, Item Identification and Valuation. This DOD UID policy and the  7003 clause have been loaded into the PIXS repository.  *********************************************************************** Update 2 June 2005, 0745 The hardware and software attachment dated 1 June 2005 (posted yesterday)  omitted the information for CLIN 0015.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA209), is conducting a market survey seeking other government agencies, industry, academia, nonprofits, and Federal Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) partners for information to aid in the planning of future technologies to integrate into the U.S. Navy’s Terrain Awareness Warning Systems (TAWS) (DTED based) for use in rotary wing and tilt rotor aircraft. This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  This is not a Request for Proposal or an indication that the Navy will contract for these supplies/services.  The Navy will not pay for information received in response to this RFI.  

Detailed Description: 

Specifically, the U.S. Navy seeks to ascertain information relative to current and/or future TAWS enhancing capabilities. TAWS will be used to provide an increased level of protection against Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) for its rotary wing and tilt rotor aircraft during flight over varying terrain and Nap of the Earth (NOE) flight, where terrain along the future flight path of the aircraft is as important as that directly beneath the aircraft. Platforms targeted for this system include the MH-60R/S, H-1, and the tilt rotor V-22.  

Limitations inherent in the basic Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) currently deployed in Navy/Marine Corps rotary wing aircraft result in areas of reduced or no protection against CFITs, particularly against flight into rising terrain.  The Navy’s tactical TAWS was developed to provide additional forward-looking predictive capabilities and enhance protection against CFIT provided by the basic GPWS.  The Navy’s TAWS is a software solution tailorable to multiple Navy/Marine Corps platforms.  The Navy is looking to enhance its existing TAWS (DTED Level 1 based) by including “look-ahead” capability for ground and/or obstacle detection in low level flight.  Due to weight and space limitations on most Navy/Marine Corps rotary wing platforms, a software enhancement to TAWS possibly utilizing existing sensors is preferred, however both software and hardware solutions will be considered.  

Interested sources should identify challenges relative to their solution and describe how those challenges will be approached.  For example, TAWS that utilize Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) Level 1 encounter challenges with data resolution since most helicopters maneuver in distances that are inside the current resolution limits of the digital data.  The information submitted on currently available or planned systems must describe what integration is required to implement the system onboard the targeted platforms, and how it would impact the electrical, weight, space, power, environmental conditions, and processing parameters of the platform. Describe in sufficient detail the supportability requirements of the system such as: maintenance concept (including built-in-test (BIT) capabilities), support equipment, supply and computer resources support, and training. Provide demonstrated Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) figures for existing systems as well as predicted MTBFs for future systems.  Provide a notional delivery schedule for systems currently available and/or anticipated time frames for proposed systems.  

RFI Response Requirement:  

Based upon the above detailed description and basic requirement, the U.S. Navy requests interested sources to provide responses to the additional specific questions:
 
1)	What type of objects would be detected (size and range)?  
2)	For detected objects, what is the accuracy (size and range)?  
3)	Can the system be commanded by TAWS to scan a specific range and bearing?  
4)	What type of information is provided back to TAWS?
5)	What is the Rough Order of Magnitude cost of any existing system and/or planned system that may provide TAWS enhancing capability in low-level flight as outlined above?
6)	What is the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for the proposed idea or technology?

The page limitation is requested to only 15 pages in order to effectively review each RFI response.   Interested parties should provide responses with product/service specifications no later than 60 days from the date of this notice. All information received in response to this announcement will be kept confidential.  Additional information on the TAWS Program is provided at the following web site:
http://pma209.navair.navy.mil/teams/navigation/gpws/home.asp
 
This RFI does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NAVAIR to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) that will be reviewed will provide (at no cost to NAVAIR) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the RFI. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience consistent with the efforts synopsized for the specified NAVAIR proposal. 

All RFI responses should be sent to: The Naval Air Systems Command, Attn: Paula Jackson, 47123 Buse Road, Unit IPT, Bldg. 2272, Suite 350, Patuxent River, MD   20670-1547. 

The preferred method of submission is via email to: Paula.Jackson@navy.mil. E-mail your technical questions to Tom Anderson at:Thomas.E.Anderson@navy.mil. The due date for submission is COB 14 JUNE 2005 (60 days from date of notice).

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to award a sole source contract to Spring Valley Laboratories, Inc for a one-year period for Maintenance and Technical Manipulation of Rabbits at NIH, Bethesda, MD. The contact will contain the following clause FAR 52.219-8, Option to Extend Services. Care of rabbits will be in accordance with current animal welfare regulations and policies.  Authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set for in FAR 6.302-1. NIAID has been conducting a long-term breeding and immunization experiment, for several years to study the development of autoimmunity in rabbit models of the human autoimmune disease Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).  The colony of genetically defined pedigreed rabbits, animals being used in this experiment, and the inbred rabbits being maintained are important resources for current and future NHGRI rabbit genome sequencing.  The stress of moving these animals would seriously negate several years of experimental studies now in progress and would impact on the final results of the study. For this reason, Spring Valley Laboratories, Inc has been identified as the only responsible source for this requirement.  If you have any questions or comments please respond in writing to Carolyn Wilder at cwilder@niaid.nih.gov on or before June 27, 2005 at 2:00 pm EDT. See Number Note 22.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post questions and answers to Solicitation No. S-AQMPD-05-R-1002. Therefore the questions and answers are as follows:

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

1.  As referenced in Modification No. 1, can the “Software House Enterprise Partner Certification” required be proposed by the contractor be certified under the subcontractor?  Yes, as long as it is listed in the contractor’s subcontracting plan.

2.  In Section H.1, what is the correct acronym for Security Installation Managers?  As stated under Section H.1 the correct acronym is SIMs, the lower case “s” indicates that there will be more than one Security Installation Manager.
3.  What the contract type?  Firm-fixed-Price, T&M, Performance-Based Contract.

4.  Under Section H.2 (g), in the second sentence indicates “paragraph 2.1” it should indicate paragraph H.3 instead, therefore delete “2.1” at the end of the second sentence and replace it with “H.3”.

5.  Will the government provide position descriptions for identified CLINS?  No.

6.  Will the government issue official passports for foreign travel? No, only authorized on a case-by-case situation when official passports can not be attained by contractor(s).

7.  Do we need to submit the overtime rates? Yes.

8.  What are your Agency’s Small Business Goals?  The Agency’s Small Business Goals can be found at following website: http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/25945.doc

9.  In Section C, C.4.8 Incidental Expenses, may the contractor charge fixed at 3% of purchase price towards profit?  No, the fixed  3% fee is only to be charge as a purchase fee. 

10.  In Section H., H.2 (d), states that hazardous duty premium pay shall not be burdened with any indirect costs (e.g. overhead, G&A) or fee/profit.  This in indirect conflict with contractor’s DCAA approved accounting method.  How do we address this conflict?  As stated in Section H., H.2 (b), “Travel costs shall not be burdened with any indirect costs unless specifically allowable in accordance with the contractor’s usual accounting practices consistent with FAR Subpart 31.2.  In no event shall travel costs be burdened with fee/profit.”  Therefore, if your company is approved by DCAA of this accounting method your company must show proof of DCAA approval when billing against such costs.

11.  In Section L, L.17.1 Proposal Packaging and Delivery, in this section no room number is listed in the address for hand delivery, FedEx, DHL, etc. Please clarify the room number for hand deliveries.  The Room Number is 200.

12.  Section D, D.2 is entitled “Packing of Supplies for Domestic Shipment”, and D.7 is entitled identical.  Should D.7 be address for Packaging Supplies for Overseas Shipment?  No, D.7 is a typo therefore, delete paragraph D.7 in its entirety.

13.  Dispatch & Trouble Shooting Services Center (Page 22) - CLIN 0002B requests that a Firm Fixed Price be submitted for Field Support Required Services 2-2 through 2-7. Please provide estimates for (2.2) - number of requests for assistance per month, and (2.4) - number of domestic dispatches per month.  For (2.2) current numbers average 435 per month and (2.4) – number of domestic dispatches per month, current numbers average 430 per month.

14.  Appendix  E indicates a list of software and Maximo product is mentioned does Maximo is the same as Maximo Enterprise? The software listed indicates for Maximo Enterprise (Suite).

15.  In Section C, C.2.3 (page 13) the third bullet under objectives mentions compliance with the “Facility Security and Engineering lifecycle plan”.  Is a copy of this plan available to all bidders?  Detailed information regarding specific plans is Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) and will not be released. The objective is to ”incorporate new equipment” during the TSU.  Each TSU is defined during the design.  Not having this information is of no consequence for a bidder and to no advantage for the incumbent.

16.  Service 2.13 (Page 23) - This service is to manage and maintain a security network.  If the network is used for user-to-user communications, please provide the following so we can better understand the requirement and respond appropriately in our proposal.

(1) The number of workstations (or PCs) on the network.   Less than 50 total workstations on the access control network for DME.  Six C*Cure servers, one in HST is actually two units mirrored together.  All workstations and servers are used to support both legacy and new access control and Intrusion Detection systems.

(2) Principle operating system of the workstations (or PCs) (is UNIX, Window NT, Windows XP, etc)  All workstations have Windows 2000 installed, with the exception of one legacy unit in NH and runs IBM OS2.

(3) Any servers in use on the network and what services they provide (such as storage or printing) if the network provides more than real-time point-to-point communication.  The two servers in HST that are used to run the Software House C*Cure software utilize a progress database and there are several workstations at several sites that are used for badging operations. These badging systems consist of a workstation, camera and badging printer.  We have internal DNS servers in support of the C*Cure system.

(4) Any network/system management tools currently in use (such as IBM Tivoli, HP Openview, BMC Patrol, CA Unicenter, etc).  Solarwind to track the status of the routers used for the C*Cure system.

(5) Physical characteristics of the Network (Topology, Backbone Protocols, Throughput and Performance Characteristics).  The WAN is composed of frame relay circuits and point-to-point connections.  The frame circuits we use have a CIR of approximately 38k.  Additionally, some of the remote sites have a 128, ISDN connection as a backup.  We also have sites that have point-to-point connectivity ranging form DS1 to DS3.  The majority of the traffic for the DS alarm network is TCP/IP and some legacy systems that use NetBios.  The LAN is a standard point-to-point, router, switch configuration.

(6) Security Requirements.  At this time a closed, stand alone system that has no connection to the DS OpenNet, ClassNet, Intranet or Internet.  However, in the future this network may be connected to one or all of the above mentioned networks.

(7) IDS Requirements (network, host, both).  “IDS” we assumes that this means NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System).  We do not currently deploy NIDS on the DS Alarm Network.  We are open to suggestions.

17.  Service 2.14 (Page 25) - Please define the term:  “work order completion ratio” used on this page.  For example, what does the phrase “maintain an 80% work order completion ratio (worldwide)” mean?  This refers to the amount of work orders received vs. the amount of work orders completed for one week.  For example, 100 received 80 completed will translate to an 80% completion ratio.

18.	H.8 (b) (Page 42) - Please clarify whether the term “overall project management overhead” refers to the firm fixed price task perform Objective 1. Program Management (Page 18), or whether it is expected that “labor hours identified as managers or administrative support” be included as a component of the burden placed on labor.  Direct management overhead refers to Objective 1.  All indirect support should be included as a component of the burden placed on labor, for example H.7.

19.  L.17.3, Volume 2 (Page 75).  Please clarify that the only permitted modification to the Tables in Section B as part of proposal submission is the introduction of up to 2500 hours
of labor in new labor categories as indicated in paragraph B.2 on page 2.  If other modifications are permitted, please clarify what they are so that all cost proposals are comparable.   These are only permitted modifications.  The SubCLIN numbering should 
start with 0005AA (Not 0005A).

21.  Section C.3.9 (Page 15), states: "the success of this contract is dependent on both the government and contractor's ability to migrate from a traditional service contract to a 
performance-based services contract."  Section C.4.2 (Page 16), states: "As some of the time and materials services are better defined throughout the period of performance, the Government will negotiate these services to be incorporated and performed under fixed-price task orders." Please confirm that the bidders are being asked to address their approach to transition all or some Time and Material…Services, CLIN 0005, to Fixed Price Task Orders, CLIN 0008?  Yes, this is what the government is asking the bidders to provide.  Further, please confirm that in Section C.3.9, the term "traditional service contract" equates to Time and Material…Services, CLIN 0005, and that the term "performance-based services" equates to Fixed Price Task Orders, CLIN 0008.  No, traditional refers to non-performance-based regardless of whether time and material or fixed-price.  Performance-based can equate to time and materials.

20.  L.17.3 (Page 75) and I.6(c) (Page 46) - The term "award term years" is used in Section L.17.3, Cost/Price Proposal, but is not discussed elsewhere in the RFP. Further, Section I.6(c) states: “The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of the options under this clause, shall not exceed five (5) years.” Please clarify the Government’s intent regarding the option to use additional “award term years” as a performance-based incentive.  The government will not be using the “award term year” concept.	

21.  Paragraph C.3.6 (Page 15) and Appendix E – Paragraph C.3.6 states: “Only DS approved software may be used to complete assigned tasks on DoS-owned computer systems.” Of the software listed in Appendix E, only Peoplesoft offers a Help Desk module. Would the Government permit use of another more widely used Help Desk suite other than Peoplesoft?   The government is not committed to using Peoplesoft as a help desk module.  A pilot program for Maximo is planned to begin by the end of the fiscal year.

22.  Can we attain a copy of your equipment catalog? Yes, see attachment no. 1 and 2.


All else remains unchange.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post questions and answers to Solicitation No. S-AQMPD-05-R-1006 as follows:

Questions and Answers:

1.  P. 4, “Estimated hours are for proposal evaluation only”  How will number of hours estimated be evaluated?  This is not laid out in Section M.  The estimated hours are evaluated by based upon price/cost which is listed in Section M, M.6 on page 66.

2.  P.12, Task 1.4 references Services Level Agreements, but SLA’s are not required as part of the proposal. Can this disparity be reconciled?  No, it is as stated in the RFP.

3.  P. 19: Task 2.9 Please scope the approximate number of databases in use, the number anticipated to be needed, etc. for this task.  Also, please scope the approximate size and complexity of the databases currently in use. There are a dozen or so small MS Access databases to support administrative functions.  There is also a content management system in place to support web updates.

4.  In Section L.7.2, "Proposal Guidelines," the RFP lists "Handling Anticipated Changes in Workload Volume" as one of the items to include in the Management Approach.  Section M.7 lists “unanticipated changes" under "Adequacy of Management Plan." Please clarify whether it is anticipated or unanticipated changes in workload. There is always a possibility of workload changes as the organization adjusts to meet desired outcomes.  A dramatic change is not anticipated.

5.  Section L.7.2 requests three past performance contracts. Will the Government clarify whether that is three each for the prime contractor and each proposed subcontractor or whether it is three total?  Three (3) for each prime and sub.

6.  Will the Government consider excluding Past Performance from the 75-page technical proposal limit?  Actually, the Past Performance should be included within the 75-page technical proposal limit.

7.  Will the government provide the names and contact information of contractor employees who are currently performing on the contract? No, such information must be requested in a FOIA Request. 

8.  What is the anticipated date of award for this contract?   The contract is estimated to be awarded  by September 30th.

9.  Appendix C lists the current FTE support levels at each DS facility.  However, it is not clear whether the quantity of personnel listed are solely dedicated to the specific task mentioned or whether they perform multiple tasks.  Would the 
government include the number of FTEs by position as well?  Personnel are not solely dedicated to the specific task.
     
10.  Please provide a percentage breakdown of the evaluation factors – Cost and Technical   None is currently listed in Section M.  As stated, in Section M, M.2 “Award will not be automatically determined by numerical calculation or formula relationship between cost or price and technical merit”.
 
11.  In Section L.7.2 you describe the Proposal guidelines which state that the technical proposal is limited to 75 pages.  What page margins, and font types and sizes are acceptable?  Does an 11x 17 sheet count as 2 pages? Does the font type and size apply to tables and figures? 5 inch margins, 12 pitch, times New Roman 
font types  are preferred. 11x17 sheet count as 1 page and yes the font type and size apply to tables and figures.

12.  Appendix C does not properly represent the appropriate staffing levels for this contract.  Will you be releasing a matrix that more accurately breaks down the current staffing for each “Required Service” area?  No, it’s up the contractor to properly present the appropriate staffing to perform such task listed in the Scope of the RFP for the required services.

13.  It is unclear to us how you want the information in the Pricing Tables in Section B.2 presented.  We understand we are to provide a Labor Category for each SubCLIN.  For "Estimated Hours" are we to provide our estimated annual hours for one full time equivalent?  For example - If the Labor Category for SubCLIN
0002A is Secretary I and we estimate the hours for the base year to be 1940 and the fully loaded hourly rate to be $30 - the extended price would be $58,200 for SubCLIN 0002A regardless of the number of SubCLIN 0002A employees.  Is this how you want the table to be filled out?  This is a good example, but keep in mind 
its a performance based contract type and if the contractor estimated that if there are multiple positions need in this areas they should include the number of hours to cover the total of hours for the labor category.  And don’t forget to address the total for the base, and all option years. 

14.  Will the contractor be held to the rates that we propose in price proposal for the contract execution?  Yes...

15. Per para M.5 Negotiation, what are the contract items/issues that may be subject to negotiation?  Unknown until the Government receives your proposal.

16.  It is our goal to recruit incumbent personnel who have provided sustained, high-level performance to the Department of State. Certain incumbent personnel may not fit under the representative labor categories and rates provided in para I.6.  Does the contract have the ability to add labor categories and rates during the negotiation period to accommodate incumbent personnel that have different hour rates than what is specified in the table in para I.6.  Para 1.6 represent the labor categories this equivalent rates for the Federal Government Employees, it is up to the Contractor to proposal their rates and categories that would represent their proposal.

17.  Requirements 2.9 and 2.13 in the proposal appear to require technical skills outside of the representative labor categories provided in para I.6.  Does the contractor have the ability to add labor categories and rates during the negotiation   
period to accommodate technical personnel that have different hourly rates than what is specified in the table in para I.6?  Again its up to the Contractor on how they proposed their proposal.....

18.  What are examples of representative ODCs that could be expected under the base year and four option years for CLIN 0001 and CLIN 002?  ODCs mean Other Direct Costs, such as travel, material, equipment etc.  Other costs of contractor's 
expenses which does not fit under their Direct Costs. 

19.  For pricing proposal, is the government looking for hour rates/estimated hours for 
one full-time equivalent under each labor category?  Yes..Or, are we expected to estimated the number of total hours for the entire contract under each labor category?  Yes, the contractor should proposed costs/prices for the base and each option year.

<DESC>This synopsis is a modification to the original synopsis.  The purpose of this synopsis is to inform industry that there has been a change to the requirements in the subject solicitation.  Through this solicitation the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking proposals from offerors interested in entering into a Firm-Fixed Price (with Economic Price Adjustment) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) to support the worldwide demand for knee and hip prosthetics products that fall into the following groups:  Groups One through Four contain knee and hip prosthetic implants (either procedural and/or component pricing); Group Five contains instrumentation sets that will be used by the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) during implantation of the knee and hip prosthetic and returned to the contractor after surgery; and, Group Six contains auxiliary products needed for implantation of a knee and hip prosthetic.  Offers may be submitted on Group One through Group Six individually or collectively, except, any offer of procedural pricing must also offer component pricing of implants.   This solicitation contains an on-site personnel requirement that is applicable to offerors who submit a proposal on Groups One through Four.  The contractor will be required to provide technical advice and guidance to physicians before, during and after implantation of the prosthetic at the request of the MTFs.  Technical support shall be available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.  

This solicitation contains three delivery methods depending on the group(s) of products offered.  The three delivery methods are: Consignment, Just-in-Time and Direct Delivery.  Offerors who submit an offer that includes Group One through Four must be able to provide all three delivery methods for all product groups (including Groups Five and Six) if offered.  The MTFs will either order “Just-in-Time”, “Direct Delivery” or will use “Consignment Agreement”.  The reason for the three delivery methods is to meet the needs of the individual MTFs.  After award of any contracts resulting from this solicitation, each MTF that will be ordering will inform the contractor if they intend to use “Consignment Agreement”.  Consignment as a delivery method will be limited to those MTF that perform implant surgeries in such a number that they can turn their inventory  2.5 inventory turns a year.  Contractors who submit an offer that includes Group Five and/or Group Six only must deliver auxiliary products and instrumentation sets “Direct Delivery”.  All catalog prices submitted should be FOB Destination.  

 Contractors will be required to submit catalog(s).  It is encouraged that the catalog(s) submitted in response to this solicitation contain the offeror’s entire knee and hip product line that fall within the groups identified above.  All applicable products must be Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved.  DSCP intends to make awards to offerors who comply with the requirements of the solicitation.  This solicitation covers DSCP ECAT customers worldwide.   Offerors should submit Continental United States (CONUS) catalogs, which include all facilities, located in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia as well as Alaska and Hawaii.  These CONUS sites will be implemented first.  The Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) catalog will include facilities located outside the continental United States as defined above and will be solicited at a future date under this solicitation number.  Due to transportation costs, potential customer problems, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restrictions and/or limitations, a separately priced OCONUS catalog will therefore not be required with your initial submission under this solicitation.  For both CONUS and OCONUS catalogs, all facilities must be serviced.  After award, each contractor’s product line will be loaded into the DSCP Medical Electronic Catalog (ECAT).  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of an item inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.  Physicians from the ordering facilities will make a  “Best Value” decision when selecting products.  

All transactions sets under any resultant contracts are required to be electronic.  Each contractor will be required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850-Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional Acknowledgement’s, send 855-Order Confirmation’s and transmit 810-Invoices for payment.  There are (3) three communication options available for ECAT: Web Supplier Interface, Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX) and American National Standard Institute (ANSI) x 12 EDI Standards. Offerors must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options.  Offerors will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation. 

 Closing dates and time for receipt of proposals are hereby amended.  This solicitation allows for two open seasons: the first open season will commence on June 7, 2005 and close September 7, 2005 at 3:00 P.M./EST.  The second open season will commence December 7, 2005 and close March 7, 2006 at 3:00 P.M./EST.  Proposals received during the open season will not be evaluated before the solicitation has closed. Offerors are requested to submit complete proposals for all requirements, as specified in the solicitation. Any resultant contracts will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods.  This procurement has an estimated dollar value of $20 million dollars over the total contract period for all contracts combined.  The Solicitation and all amendments can be found on the DLA Procurement Gateway at http://progate.daps.dla.mil/home/

<CONTACT>GAYLE NORMAN, (256) 876-2053
<DESC>This amendment to synopsis W31P4Q-05-R-R020 is issued to answer the following questions.  Q.1 Will this effort require new model development, particularly for Enhanced Position Location Radio System (EPLRS), or will existing EPLRS OPNET models be imp lemented in the context of larger networks and corresponding scenarios?  A.1.  If someone other than OPNET Technologies were to perform this task they would be required to obtain, review and understand the relationship between previously developed OPNET AM RDEC custom models.  This would probably require a non-disclosure agreement between them and OPNET and would also require additional time that is not in our schedule.  This task will require the contractor to enhance exisiting EPLRS and Link-16 models, and  develop a JREAP model that is compatible with other AMRDEC OPNET models previously developed  under contract with OPNET Technologies.  Q.2.  If new model development is to be performed, will core design elements of EPLRS be furnished or will we treat the EPLRS model as black box behavorial models?  A.2.  New model development with respect to EPLRS and Link-16 shall not be performed under this contract.  Existing EPLRS and Link-16 models will be enhanced to support the JREAP capability required in the simul ation.  The core design for EPLRS and Link-16 has been completed by OPNET and proprietary issues may exist.  The JREAP model shall be built on the MIL STD 3011 and will be the property of the US Government.  Q.3.  Will the consulting services be open to a small business on a stand-alone basis, or would such a small business be encouraged to partner with a larger firm?  A.3.  Consulting services should be understood as a cooperative effort between the contractor and AMRDEC with respect to the development and  integration of the final product into the AMRDEC OPNET simulation.  Q.4.  Do you have an idea as to the duration and funding for the effort, and start date.  A.4. The duration will be 26 weeks, funding for this effort and start date are not known at this time. In addition the closing date is not extended and remains 10 June 2005, Close of Business (COB), local time CST.

<CONTACT>Steve Paschke, Business Specialist, Phone 208-526-1113, Fax 208-526-0876, Email sdp@inel.gov
<DESC>The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has developed a method of using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to characterize the quality of concrete.   Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques developed at the INL allow for monitoring of the cement curing process, as well as monitoring of the long-term performance of cement structures.  The process provides a simple, non-destructive, and inexpensive method to determine the relative permeability, stability, and durability of cementatious systems.  In addition to providing a valuable technique for the construction industry, this work could also facilitate the implementation of jet grouting and other in situ grouting techniques for waste remediation.

The INL is soliciting interest from qualified industrial firms interested in participating in projects and commercializing this technology.  It is anticipated that commercialization will be carried out by licensing this technology to a company.  Additional development and support from lead INL researchers may be possible through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, with some or all of the funding support being provided by the participant(s).  The INL is patenting this technology.  The INL invites interested parties to contact us regarding the details of licensing and implementing this technology into an operation.  Interested parties should respond on or before August 30th, 2005.  For questions regarding the technology, licensing, and working with the INL, please contact Jason Stolworthy:

Objective: The objective of this purchase is to refurbish the “radiation irradiator” at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Cobalt-60 Test Facility to meet the new radiation test levels required in the testing of the Air Force Space System electronics.  The purchase and installation of a new 5200 to 5400 Curie (but not to exceed 5,500 Curies) Cobalt-60 gamma source within the irradiator will meet these new requirements for the next five years.

2. Scope:  The scope of this purchase is limited to the replacement of the depleted Cobalt-60 source in the irradiator of the AFRL Cobalt-60 Test Facility, with a new 5200 to 5,400 Curies (but not to exceed 5,500 Curie) Cobalt-60 gamma source, and performance of related services.  The scope shall include the removal, transportation, and disposal of the old source; the purchase, transportation, installation, and calibration of the new source, and the servicing of the irradiator drive motor system at the time of installation.  Transportation of the depleted and new activity shall follow the guidelines that were implemented by Homeland Security and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Also included shall be the preparation and submission for review and approval:  a source Re-installation, and a Safety Plan for the phase of the task occurring on Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

3. Background: The present Cobalt-60 source (US Nuclear Corp. Model SDF 34-M-1 or J. L. Shepherd Model 75-1) at the AFRL Cobalt-60 Test Facility (ref. Attachments 1,2 and 3) was installed nearly four years ago (installed on 19 December 2001, with 5,326 Curies) and is licensed under the current Permit NM-30470-01/01AFP and Docket No. 030-90350, this license expires on 30 April 2005.  [Submittal for Permit renewal was submitted on 7 April 2005.]  The source radiation strength is reaching depleted near its “ half-life “ of 2663 Curies.  At this low level, the Test Facility can no longer meet all of its test requirements for proper dose rates.  The solution to the problem is to remove the depleted source capsule and replace it with a new 5200 to 5400 Curie source (not to exceed 5,500 Curie).  Such a purchase and replacement can only be accomplished safely in the confinement of a large radiation “hot cell” equipped with remote manipulators.  Since there is no hot cell large enough on Kirtland Air Force Base to perform this task, the old source (sealed in its protecting 5,000 pound lead/steel shield) must be transported off base to as appropriate cell.  The entire operation can only be performed by personnel specifically authorized by the “ Nuclear Regulatory Commission” (NRC) or by an “Agreement State.”

4. Technical Task: To accomplish the above purchase and replacement, the authorized Contractor shall perform the following tasks:


	4.1  Transportation. The Contractor shall be responsible for making all of the arrangements with the appropriate authorities for all of the transportation requirements in this purchase effort.  One copy of the Contractor’s “Pre-Shipment Radiation Survey” shall be sent with the shipping document.

	4.2 Removal and Disposal of the Depleted Source.  The Contractor is responsible in providing forklifts to remove the old source (with lead/steel shielding container).  Due to the constraints within the test facility, two different size forklifts will be needed to remove the old new source.  A 6,000 pound forklift will be needed to operate in and remove the source (with lead/steel shield) from the test cell, and a 10,000 pound forklift (or greater) to transport the source with its 5,000 pound lead/steel shield, plus 1,500 pound shipping container, to and from the delivery truck.  The Contractor shall remove and dispose of the depleted AFRL Cobalt-60 at their hot cell.  Included in the task are the detachment and transportation of the depleted source (sealed in its protecting lead/steel shield) from the AFRL Test Facility to the Contractor’s hot cell.

	4.3 Purchase and installation of a new source.  As in Task 4.2, the Contractor shall provide forklifts to install the new source.  After the removal of the depleted source from its lead/steel shield, the Contractor shall then provide and install a new 5200 to 5400 curie Cobalt-60 gamma source in the protecting shield of Task 4.2.  The Contractor shall also ensure that the new source properly fits within the source-encased cylinder (Atch.2) within the lead/steel shield.  The source capsule presently in the Encased Cylinder is illustrated in Atch. 3.  Upon completion of the new source encapsulation in the protecting shield, the Contractor shall then transport the sealed source and lead/steel shield back to Kirtland Air Force Base and install both items back into the AFRL Cobalt-60 Test Facility.  At the delivery of the new source the Contractor shall present their “Pre-shipment Radiation Survey” to the Base RSO and VS/RSO.  Upon completion of the rejoining of the source and the shield to the facility irradiator, the Contractor shall then service (e.g., lubricate, adjust, repair and if necessary make parts replacements) the irradiator’s drive system for correct source travel (“Up and Down “ operation).  A data sheet  (delivered at the time of the new source installation) identifying the new source’s manufacturer, model number, number of curies, and any additional information required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will be presented at this time. .  A copy of the engineering drawings (delivered at the time of the new source installation) of the new source capsule installed shall be delivered concurrently with the delivery of the new source capsule.

DRAFT

DRAFT

	4.4 Calibration of the New Source.  Upon completion of the new source’s installation and checkout at the AFRL Test Facility, the Contractor shall perform a “Source Calibration” at the 5 locations (6 cm, 12 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm and 100cm from center of source). The source calibration shall consist of determining the new location of the source center, the “steady-state” dose rate and the source “Rise” and “Lower” dose (measured in “roentgens”) at the specified locations. The calibration readings shall be made on the source centerline, when the source is in the Up position.  The calibration shall be done with instrumentation that has calibration, which is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  Upon completion of the calibration, the Contractor shall present a draft copy of the all the calibration points taken.  The official copy shall be delivered within 30 days after the completion of the installation and calibration of the new source.

5.  Advance Notification.  The Contractor shall notify personnel at the AFRL Cobalt-60 Test Facility at least two (2) weeks prior to performance of each of the following tasks:

	a. Removal of the depleted source (Ref. Task 4.2).  

	b. Delivery and installation of the new source (Ref. Task 4.3).

c.	Government’s POCs:
 	Mr. William Kemp or Mr. Clay  Mayberry, (505) 846-6889 or 846-4049.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake intends to procure a 1 megawatt molten carbonate fuel cell system as a small business set-aside via a firm fixed price contract using a best value evaluation method.   Sources and information are sought to determine the best means to fulfill the Government's requirements.  Companies interested in this procurement should provide in writing or via email information regarding their capability, size status and are requested to provide responses to the following: 1.  Contractors will be required to obtain National Environment Protection Agency (NEPA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approvals for the chosen site.   Information regarding policy and practices on obtaining such approvals (the processes and time generally required to make and submit an application, common difficulties encountered, contractor practices in obtaining approvals and the average length of time approvals require.) 2. What is the estimat! ed time for removal and restoration to original site conditions following completion of the contract?  3.  The Government intends to have independent verification of any power output and may have independent verification of noise, steam and pollution output.  Are there any technical constraints to having additional gauges measuring the above "in line"?  4. If steam is not utilized for power production but vented, at what temperatures would there be a visible plume (ranging from 32F to 120 F)? Are there any other atmospheric conditions other than temperature where a plume would be visible?  5.  If it is necessary to avoid a visible plume for vented steam, what would be the physical dimensions and location of the cooling tower(s) that might be employed?  6. It is the intent of the Government to obtain a 1 Megawatt power system.  This might be provided either by a single unit or a string of units.  Is there a difference in the physical square footage (footprint) for a single un! it vice a string of units?  If so, what differences are there, including height?  7.  What are the average maintenance or maintainability requirements in a given 365 day period of operation of a system?  8.  How far from a gas supply line can a system be located and what is the cost per linear foot for a gas line if run above ground?  What cost issues are applicable if the gas line is run underground? (under road, type of soil, maintaining pressure, etc).  9.  Given that each site may be unique, what would be the anticipated required time to provide a proposal following a site visit?  10. If the Government opts to have additional demonstrations at various sites, is there an ideal "production run" or assembly advantage regarding timing? (ie, materials, assembly advantages or disadvantages in providing 1 each at two sites within 6 months of each other, 5 months, one year, etc).  11. What is the estimated lead time from an award to when a system would be "test ready" in either ! a string system or a one-unit 1 Megawatt system? 12.  If the building of a single unit 1 megawatt system were phased or put into options, what logical "break points" such as design & EPA/NEPA approvals, ground preparation, etc, would there be?  13.  If the building of a string type 1 megawatt system were phased or put into options, what logical "break points" such as design & EPA/NEPA approvals, ground preparation, one string,  etc, would there be? 14.  If the system is set up as emergency power supply, does the current technology allow for an inverter that will allow operation in "stand alone" mode and can it be switched to "stand alone" mode seamlessly (no required shutdowns)? 15.  What is the current lifespan of a single unit 1 megawatt system or of a string of units for a 1 megawatt system (years of operation to major failure or replacement of major parts)?  16.  Given that in performing initial estimates, the Government found that a single 250 KW unit cost $800,000 to i! nstall and a total of $2.4 million to obtain, what is the "ballpark" estimate for a single unit 1 megawatt system and what is the "ballpark" estimate for a string of units for a 1 megawatt system?   Companies may provide any additional comments or information regarding the manufacture and test of a 1 megawatt system.  All responses will be reviewed.  Notes 1 and  26 apply. NAICS Code = 335312 Place of Performance = N/A Set Aside =100% set aside

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is seeking information on potential sources with the capabilities and facilities to provide cost effective turn key cradle-to-grave design, engineering, acquisition, sustainment logistics, and production for vehicle, manpack and aircraft variants of the Family of Loudspeakers II (FOL2). FOL2 will be the second generation loudspeaker for use on the battlefield by tactical PSYOP teams to broadcast messages to target audiences. The current vehicle system is a 1990’s design which utilized multiple components connected by numerous cables. The future systems will be required to provide additional volume and clarity while utilizing a compact wireless design and minimal cables. Commonality in the FOL family allowed the vehicle system to be utilized on watercraft with few changes. Manpack versions currently utilize a two-horn system, interface box and multiple cables in a design which is not very flexible. The future systems will be required to be configurable in multiple army common ruck systems. The current aircraft variant is used on  the UH-60A/L. The next generation will be utilized in additional rotary wing aircraft. The next generation will field several other variants that will be developed for emerging capabilities such as unmanned vehicles and loudspeakers which can be scattered from the air.  

The FOL2 will:  

1.  be replacements for FOL tactical loudspeakers systems for vehicles (FOL2-V), watercraft (FOL2-W), manpack (FOL2-M), and aircraft (FOL2-A),  

2.  be a new fielding for unmanned aircraft (FOL2-UA), unmanned vehicles (FOL2-UV), and remote scatterable loudspeakers (FOL2-RS),  

3.  the FOL2-V loudspeakers must be rapidly installed and uninstalled on the family of military vehicles (i.e. M113, M1025, M1114, LAVs, or Stryker vehicles) and commercial vehicles without major modifications to the vehicles,  

4.  the FOL2-V power will be drawn from vehicle power, 12-24VDC, or batteries,  

5.  the FOL2-V speakers must be directionally focused and adjustable to provide broadcast in all directions from the vehicle and selectable to broadcast to front, rear, or each of the quadrants of the vehicle,  

6.  the FOL2-V speaker positioning will not interfere with turret ring defense systems,  

7.  the FOL2-V speaker positioning will not be visible above the turret ring or present a high visibility signature to identify the vehicle as a PSYOP broadcast platform,  

8.  the FOL2-V cabling should be routed to avoid internal vehicle interference of the crew,  

9.  the FOL2-M speaker positioning should allow for utilization on the march,  

10.  the FOL2-M should be configurable for any of three standard separate ruck systems and weigh less than 25 pounds (15 pounds desired),  

11.  the FOL2-A should be configurable for use on the UH-60 (in Pod configuration), UH-1, OH-58, in door configurations,  

12.  the FOL2-UA would be configured for use in UAVs with the Wind Supported Aerial Delivery Systems (WSADS) as one platform,  

13.  the FOL2-UV would be mounted on a remote controlled wheeled or tracked system,  

14.  the FOL-RS would be a cost effective disposable speaker system capable of being airdropped or scattered and remotely operated,  

15.  the loudspeaker footprint be minimized to contain amplifier/power supply/horn assembly to reduce footprint and weigh less than 25 pounds (15 pounds desired),  

16.  the loudspeakers should be configurable to allow interconnection to expand the number of speakers for a larger array,  

17.  the power output from all input sources should provide a frequency response of 650-3500 Hz with a minimum 156 dB SPL at 1 meter,  

18.  Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) for all system configurations will not exceed 15% at 1/10th rated power,  

19.  permit continuous broadcast at maximum rated power for up to 3 hours,  

20.  power output controls for full range selectivity from zero to maximum power,  

21.  power controls for emergency shut down,  

22.  wireless remote control capabilities to 150 meters to manage all functions,  

23.  input devices should be digital, ruggedized, wired/wireless, connects to civilian and military microphones and headsets,  

23.  input devices should be capable of accepting and storing speaker microphone inputs, storing, reviewing, and transmitting in selectable increments,  

25.  input devices should be capable of connecting to standard commercial audio devices and record, store, review, and transmit messages,  

26.  input devices should allow for direct broadcast through loudspeakers,  

27.  input devices should have touch screen to select and play messages and play options,  

28.  installation/de-installation times not to exceed 15 minutes,  

29.  the entire system must be rugged,  

30.  employ worldwide in both hostile and non-hostile environments, and in a variety of terrain and climatic conditions,  

31.  the systems will be maintained using a two tier support structure, organizational and depot,  

32.  replacement of parts should be modularized and require no special equipment,  

33.  interoperability with legacy FOL systems is not required,  

34.  components should be self testing and failure reporting.  


Specific information desired is documented capability and ability with systems similar to FOL with special emphasis on scalability and modularity to: 

1.  support multiple users geographically dispersed,  

2.  design, develop, and produce (or build to specification) systems similar to FOL,  

3.  produce in one year the entire anticipated requirement numbers,  

4.  provide total turn-key life cycle support,

<SUBJECT>B -- Adverse Childhood Experiences Study Propective Phase
<DESC>This is for informational purposes only. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to engage in a sole source purchase order with The Positive Choice Wellness Center in San Diego, CA 92111.  The intent of this purchase order is to purchase the data from the ACE Study which is being conducted by Kaiser Permanente’s Department of Preventive Medicine in San Diego in collaboration with the Emerging Investigations and Analytical Methods Branch of DACH/NCCDPHP. Initial clinical observations at Kaiser linked childhood sexual abuse to treatment failure of severe obesity. A case-control study conducted by Kaiser Permanente was subsequently published relating childhood sexual abuse to more diverse adult health chronic health problems.  The ACE Study is the largest and most comprehensive study ever undertaken to examine the long-term consequences of childhood abuse and household dysfunction on health behaviors and outcomes, including those related to chronic disease. Between 1995 and 1997, 17,000 adult members of Kaiser Health Plan in San Diego enrolled in the landmark Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study. Results from the baseline surveys of the ACE Study led to ongoing collaboration between Kaiser’s Department of Preventive Medicine and DACH/EIAMB  resulting in more than 30 peer-reviewed scientific publications, both national and international media attention, Congressional briefings, and numerous invitations to present study findings at national and international meetings and at Kaiser in San Diego, results of the ACE Study are directly impacting the practice of preventive medicine and primary care.  A grant from the Garfield Fund, which had been used to support the ongoing prospective phase of the ACE Study, expired in 2004. The purpose of the prospective phase of the ACE Study is to provide a comprehensive investigation of the impact of adverse childhood experiences on the incidence of disease in adulthood and the utilization of health care services. The IRB protocol makes the suggested vendor who has the access to and institional permission to use the Kaiser database systems for the pruposes of extracting information about ACE study participants as described above.  It is the belief of the this is the only vendor who has access to the personal identifiers for the ACE study participants, therefore this is the only known source that can provide the databases needed. The Request for Quotations will be available from this website only; within 24 hours of this notice. Questions regarding the RFQ shall be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer. Questions are due by June 14, 2005.  Questions will only be taken by email.  Once the questions are submitted and answered they will be posted at this location for all to view.  Quotations are to be mailed to the Contracting Officer to the address listed above.  You may email questions to: dreedpenix@cdc.gov, referencing the RFQ number 2005-Q-02061.  The RFQ is due June 23, 2005, by 3:00 PM EST and will only be accepted by mail, fax and or email is not acceptable. Vendor wishing quotation must be registered in the Central Contracting Registry before being considered for award. For further information regarding the Central Contracting Registry can be accessed at www.ccr.gov.  It is the government’s intent to award this procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<SUBJECT>A -- Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) Clinical Consortium
<DESC><B>INTRODUCTION:</b> National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks industry collaborators to participate in coordinated clinical, epidemiological and behavioral studies that will analyze the risks and benefits of bariatric surgery and its impact on the health and well-being of patients with extreme obesity, and identify the kinds of patients who are most likely to benefit.  Industry collaborators able to provide clinical expertise in the evaluation, screening, dosing, and follow up of patients at risk for venous thromboembolism following bariatric surgery; and/or evaluate the pathogenesis, genetic factors, and other pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative features or factors that are believed to affect the outcomes following bariatric surgery; and/or identify unique methods to evaluate alternate bariatric surgical therapies are sought.
<P>
A prospective database of adult patients with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery will be created by the NIH Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) Clinical Consortium that will allow the prospective evaluation and longitudinal follow-up of a large group of patients in a standardized fashion.  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological, and mechanisms of action research in patients undergoing bariatric surgery at six clinical sites using a standardized and coordinated approach to their evaluation, operative procedure, and follow up.  Ancillary studies to evaluate the pathogenesis, genetic features, and other factors that may affect outcomes after bariatric surgery are also anticipated.  It is expected that the following will be participating: six clinical sites at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Pennsylvania), Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital and Cornell University (New York), East Carolina Medical Center (North Carolina), Neuropsychiatric Research Institute (North Dakota), University of California, Davis (California) and the University of Washington (Washington); and a Data Coordinating Center at the Graduate School of Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh.  
<P> 
<B>SUMMARY:</b> The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institute of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services is seeking proposals in the form of Capability Statements from companies to enter into a collaborative arrangement to provide clinical expertise in the evaluation, screening, dosing, and follow up of patients at risk for venous thromboembolism following bariatric surgery; and/or identify unique methods to evaluate alternate bariatric surgical therapies.  The collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA’s).  The NIDDK is also seeking proposals from companies for a collaborative arrangement to evaluate the pathogenesis, genetic factors, and other pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative features or factors that are believed to affect the outcomes following bariatric surgery. 
<P>
Examples of potential studies include:
(a)  identification of host biomarkers and/or genetic typing factors associated with the development of severe obesity;
(b)  exploration of the pharmacokinetics and dosing regimens for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in bariatric surgery patients;
(c)  evaluation of the possible screening tests for pre-existing thromboembolism; and
(d)  identification of unique methods to evaluate alternate bariatric surgical therapies such as the laparoscopic banding procedure.
<P>
<B>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</b>  Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA's).  CRADA's are agreements, pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), designed to enable certain collaborations between Government and non-government parties and/or laboratories.  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADA’s are neither grants nor contracts for the procurement of goods or services.  The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a collaborator in a Clinical Trial or a CRADA.  Under both a Clinical Trial agreement and a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise, but not funding, to the collaboration.  Under a CRADA a collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise and funding to the collaboration. The collaborator, under a CRADA, receives an option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use.
<P>
<B>STUDY GOAL:</b>
The overall goal of this study is to perform coordinated clinical, epidemiological, and mechanisms of action research in patients undergoing bariatric surgery at six clinical sites using a standardized and coordinated approach to their evaluation, operative procedure, and follow up.  In this longitudinal and observational study, a database will be developed on adult patients with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery.   The relationship of defined pre- and intra- operative factors to post-surgical outcomes such as weight loss, surgical complications, and co-morbidity improvements will be studied. The LABS consortium has an interest in assessing in more detail the pre-operative risk factors, screening tests, and dosing of prophylactic agents used for venous thromboembolism prevention.  In addition, the LABS consortium is interested in assessing in more detail other potential factors that affect surgical outcomes.  Furthermore, LABS is interested in the possible future study and identification of host genetic factors.    
<P>
<B>OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION:</b> 
Whole blood will be collected from participants enrolled in LABS studies.  Serum and plasma from participants in the study will be collected.  Tissue from liver biopsies may also be available.
<P>
<B>CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:</b>  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages.  The Selection Committee will be considering its selection based upon data in the Capability Statement which addresses the following selection criteria below.   If no data are available, the potential Collaborator should so indicate.
<Br>
1.	The Capability Statement should provide specific details of the methods and materials to be utilized in the evaluation, screening, dosing, and expertise in following patients at risk for venous thromboembolism, if venous thromboembolism is the subject of the proposal.  Potential collaborators should provide evidence for proposed dosing regimens, possible strategies to assess administration of medication, proposed methods for assessing drug levels and pharmacokinetics.<Br>
2.	The Capability Statement should provide specific details and proof of research expertise in the area of the genetics of obesity, if genetics is the subject of the proposal.<Br>
3.	The Capability Statement should provide evidence and specific details of expertise in areas related to the pathogenesis of severe obesity and/or the expertise in the area of proposed factors believed to be related to surgical outcomes.  
4.	The Capability Statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results and ability to be bound by PHS intellectual property policies if a CTA or CRADA is entered (see CRADA:  http://ott.od.nih.gov/newpages/crada.pdf ).
<P>
<B>TERMS:</b> The Collaborator will be expected to execute either a Clinical Trial Agreement or a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA).  Examples of each can be found at http://techdev.niddk.nih.gov/forms.htm. No funding from the government is available.
<P>
<B>SUBMISSION DATES:</b>  Only written Capability Statements received by the NIDDK on or before September 9, 2005 will be considered.  Applicants meeting the criteria set forth in this announcement will be invited at the Applicant’s own expense to discuss with the Study Steering Committee their plans, capabilities, and research findings and expertise pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Study’s Steering Committee, date to be determined.

<SUBJECT>L -- Commercialization Opportunity for Mercury Measurement & Control Technologies
<DESC>The Tennessee Valley Authority(TVA) intends to license or sell three (3)technologies related to the measurement and control of Mercury in gases. 1) A method to compensate for interferences to mercury measurement in gases (patent number 5,750,992),the technology compares photometric measurements of a sample flue gas with and without mercury eliminating measurement interferences from the other components of the flue gas.  2)A dry gas-phase technology that converts oxidized mercury to elemental mercury to permit the measurement of total mercury in exhaust gases (patent number 5,879,948). No catalyst is involved and the method prevents the re-oxidation of mercury with congeneric components in the exhaust gas.  3) A technology related to the control of Mercury in exhaust gases (patent number 6,136,281), this technology relates to the use of a catalyst in the oxidation of Hg(0) in a flue gas stream prior to standard emissions control equipment.  The oxidized mercury is more soluble and therefore more easily removed from the flue gas stream by wet processes such as a two-stage wet FGD.

Potential licensees or buyers should express interest in the technology in writing by mail or fax to TVA no later than 06/22/2005, including a brief statement of your experience and capabilities to commercialize the technology.  TVA's Research & Technology Applications staff will be available on a fee basis for technology engineering and commercialization support.  Reply and requests for additional information should be directed to Tracey R. Willingham, Contract Agent, Services  Contracts, Post Office Box 1010, CTR 2U, Muscle Shoals, Alabama  35662-1010, Telephone (205) 386-2279, Fax (205) 386-3250.

<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate intends to acquire on an other than full and open competition basis, under the authority FAR 6.302-1, a contract to provide maintenance, materials, and troubleshooting support for the Hybrid Electric (HE) H igh Mobility Maintenance Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  Services shall consist of telephonic support, on-site support, and/or support at the contractor facility.  A Time and Material contract with three, one year, option periods is contemplated.   DRS Test Mana gement, Inc., the intended source, is the original integrator of the Hybrid Electric (HE) component, and the only known firm that has the unique qualifications to support the Hybrid Electric Vehicle(HEV). Furthermore, DRS retains proprietary rights on tech nical data necessary to support the HEV, therefore it was determined that no other source has the expertise, experience, and design data necessary to satisfy the Government's requirement.  The costs that would be duplicated for another firm to acquire a si milar capability would be substantial.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by this agency.   This acquisition will be conducted using Alpha Contracting techniques; therefore a formal solicitation for this program will n ot be issued.  Any questions in regard to this announcement must be submitted in writing no later than 25 July 2005, 2:00 pm EST to the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, Attn: AMSRD-AMR-AA-C (K.

The following clause applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text:

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>The purpose of this posting is to provide Question and Answers for Fluid Dispensing System Solicitation Number F1Q2EM5122A100 and to change building number from 788 to 779.

Q.  Where will the install be:  ceiling, wall, etc.
A.  The tanks will be installed next to a wall.  The hoses will drop down from the ceiling.

Q.  What is the height of the building?  
A.  50 ft

Q.  Will the reels require bracketing?
A.  Yes, for each set of hose reels installed in the ceiling.

Q.  Will this require reels or not?
A.  Yes, one for each fluid type.  

Q.  Does this application require high-pressure hoses?
A.  Yes, for the 10:1 ratio hydraulic and oil tanks

Q.  How far is the distance from the main feed or pumps to the 300-gallon cylinder style tanks?  We rationalize that the distance for pulling/usage will not exceed 50 ft, the amount of hose on the reel.

    A.	The distance from the main feed will be about 115 ft from the hose to the tanks located against the wall.    
    A.	Correct, the distance for pulling/usage will be about 32ft, not exceeding 50ft.  

Clarifications on Project
	This project requires 3-300 gallon square tanks only.  Our facility cannot accommodate anything larger than this.  One tank with 3 separated compartments by double walls with 300 capacities each will suffice.  
	We require a separate pump for each product upload/discharge pressure to avoid cross-contamination.  
	Depending on the make-up for the antifreeze tank, we require 3-1:1 pumps, 2-10:1 hydraulic pump for each product
