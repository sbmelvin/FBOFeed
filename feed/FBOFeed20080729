<DESC><p>The Guidance and Control (G&amp;C) liquid cooler test bench is an intermediate and depot level test bench used to test repaired components of the complete G&amp;C liquid cooler and to test and calibrate the G&amp;C liquid cooler test sets used in the field and includes SRU level repair.&nbsp; The test benches at the Wings are used to test the G&amp;C liquid cooler components that are ready to be installed in the launch facility and to calibrate the G&amp;C liquid cooler test sets.</p>
<p>The G&amp;C liquid cooler test benches, managed by the ICBM program office, are equipped with two sensors that are no longer in production.&nbsp; The project will address the ICBM G&amp;C liquid cooler test bench Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues to eliminate obsolescenc issue for the two sensors within the test stand.&nbsp; The required flow meters&nbsp;are not procurable or reparable and because of the low number of or lack of spare assets, the government can no longer support the test bench.&nbsp; It is estimated that the present supplies of these sensors will allow the lifetime of the test bench to end in or before 2010.&nbsp; In order to increase the lifetime of the test bench to 2030, suitable replacements for the liquid and gas flow meters must be selected and installed.</p>
<p>The government currently requires replacements of the liquid flow meter, the gas flow meter and their display to be identified and demonstrated and tested as form, fit, and function replacements.</p>
<p>The contractor shall identify, document, integrate and deliver a prototype with replacement flow meters, displays, and other necessary equipment that will meet the system specifications and also meet the form, fit, and function requirements.&nbsp; The contractor shall install and test the prototype flow meters, displays, and other necessary equipment at F.E.

<DESC><p>The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) intends to invite bids on the provision of water distribution systems.<br /><br />NAMSA is serving as the NATO contracting agency for this project, which is being funded by authorization of the Infrastructure Committee. A first International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for this project was initiated in November 2007 with a Notification of Intent (NOI) to Invite Bids following the original approval of the project by the Infrastructure Committee. Despite the list of potential sources that were submitted for this project, and despite the fact that all nominated companies were contacted, no compliant bids in response to the Request for Proposal (RFP) were received. Consequently, NAMSA is inviting NATO-member nations to nominate additional companies to the bidders list for the project.</p>
<p>The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for the IFB is IFB-5HQ27008-20. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this procurement, it must first be approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The U.S. Department of Commerce is authorized to approve for participation in NATO ICB those firms with a facility located within the United States. Please visit the following website for a copy of the NATO ICB application:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
</span></p>
<p>A firm that has been approved for participation in NATO ICB must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. A DOE is used to nominate a firm to the bidders list for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which uses the DOE to nominate the firm to the bidders list. The NATO contracting agency will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.</p>
<p>Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the NATO contracting agency when the IFB has been issued.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DEADLINES<br /><br />1. Final date to request a Declaration of Eligibility: 11 August 2008<br /><br />2. Anticipated date that the contracting agency will distribute the RFP: TBD</p>
<p>3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: TBD</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a fixed price purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Douglas Instruments located in Bershire, United Kingdom.
<p>The scope of this purchase order is to purchase the Oryx4 Crystallization System to include installation and training at custom labs to perform crystallization studies.</p>
<p>The overall purpose of the project will take three dimensional crystal structure analyses of potentially pandemic viral proteins. Getting diffraction quality crystals is the crucial step to solve the three dimensional structures. Center for Disease Control and Prevention requires a system that performs both micro seeding by the "MMS" method and micro bath-under-oil methods. It sets up optimization grids where protein is varied in one direction and an additive is varied orthogonally. The system sets up micro bath-under-oil experiments where all drops are well-formed and covered with oil Micro bath-under-oil is particularly useful for sensitive samples such as viral proteins and viral particles with the Oryx4 sets up micro seeding experiments where only 200 nl valuable seed stock are wasted. The Oryx4 tips are reusable.</p>
<p>Douglas Instruments has been identified as the vendor that sells the Oryx4 Crystallization System (naoliter drop setters) that performs efficiently "MMS" micro seeding Method or the micro bath-under-oil method.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code is 423490</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but all replies received within 15 days of publication will be considered. A determination not to compete based on responses received, and to proceed with a noncompetitive award is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>Description of Requirement:  The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Air Traffic Organization Operations Planning (ATO-P), Research and Technology Development Office, Airport and Aircraft Safety Group is  responsible for conducting research in support of the development of regulations, safety polities and guidance materials to continue enhancement of aviation safety.  The FAA SMS Doctrine, Order VS 8000.1, describes the FAA data-driven approach to provide effective safety oversight.  The FAA has taken major steps to implement the SMS Doctrine to aviation safety, air traffic management (ATM), airport safety, and international aviation.  As part of the FAA SMS approach to manage increased safety, the FAA has taken initiatives to "promote and expand safety information sharing efforts, including FAA-industry partnerships and data-driven safety programs that identify, prioritize, and address risks before they lead to accidents. "  Safety Management System (SMS) is being adopted worldwide as the primary means of promoting aviation safety and accident prevention initiatives.
The Flight Safety Team (AJP6350) has been conducting specific studies of events that might have safety implications by analyzing available data systems in support of the FAA safety objectives.  AJP6350 supports the FAA's safety goals by taking responsibility for developing, managing and conducting research activities that bolster FAA aviation safety, particularly the achievement of the FAA Goal of Increased Safety as outlined in the FAA Flight Plan 2008-2012.  
Typical examples of research projects currently supported by AJP6350 are:
Aviation risk analysisAviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS)Terminal Area SafetyAircraft icing researchSoftware and digital system safetyUnmanned aircraft system researchAdvanced aircraft systemsNextGen safety initiatives
These research activities require:
  Analysis of a broad range of safety data collected from actual operations around the world to identify technical areas of potential safety issues, to conduct safety risk analysis and to verify and validate outputs generated from safety research initiatives.    Accident data on a broad range of airplane types, such as regional jets, propeller airplanes, turbo-props, etc., that operate in both domestic and foreign airspace;  Access to a broad range of aviation safety data systems such as Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) data for incidents reports, Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) by multiple airlines internationally and other international aviation data systems;  The Contractor must own, operate and manage these data sharing systems, which contain data submitted from member airlines operating around the globe, in a manner that protects the airlines proprietary information but is still available for direct and easy extraction of information relevant to specific aviation events, identify potential risks and safety trends.  The contractor must have personnel who have extensive experience and knowledge in the following subjectsall with an emphasis on international aviation:  safety, flight operations, fleet management, certification and airworthiness issues, maintenance and inspection requirements, airspace and air traffic management, air navigation and communications
At this time, the International Air Transportation Association (IATA), located in Montreal, Canada, is the only organization known to possess these capabilities.  IATA owns global aviation databases and employs a complementary staff of aviation accident experts who have a depth of experience with records and coverage of aviation accidents worldwide.  IATA maintains two data systems that are critical to the success of the research contemplated by the FAA.  Their Safety Trend Evaluation, Analysis & Data Exchange System (STEADES systems contain, respectively, information needed to reduce accidents through identification of safety trends that will be used to make risk management decisions to improve safer flights in the future.  Flight Data Analysis (FDA) is a database that contains uploads of member airlines' flight recorders, vital information necessary for analysis safety trends and making accident-avoidance decisions.
IATA is considered to be the only source with the requisite data and technical experts capable of successfully responding to the FAA's requirement.  Therefore, the FAA intends to enter into a single source, five-year contract with IATA.  
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If you do not agree with this single source determination, you must provide evidence of your ability to meet all of the requirements listed above for the FAA to evaluate.  All responses to this announcement must be in writing and directed to Phyliss Schlegel no later than close of business Tuesday, August 8, 2008.  Responses may be sent to the attention of Ms. Schlegel by fax at 609.485-4088 or by e-mail at: phyliss.schlegel@faa.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
Interested Parties having all the capabilities to perform the services described in the Statement of Work (SOW) are requested to submit capability statements, limited to not more than 10 pages, to be received within 15 days of publication of this notice to: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Headquarters Procurement Services (MA-642.2), Attn: Richard Bonnell, 1000 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20585, e-mail: richard.bonnell@hq.doe.gov.
Notice of Intent: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", the Department of Energy (DOE) is planning to issue a sole-source contract to Air Techniques International to conduct pre-operational, independent inspection and testing of High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters to verify certain characteristics or properties which will determine acceptance or rejection of that filter.  The HEPA filters provide critical protection to the public, worker and the environment from postulated accidental release of radioactive materials from DOE nuclear facilities which are operated by private companies.  The HEPA filters are purchased by the operating companies from various filter manufacturers and per DOE requirements, these filters need to be independently tested and accepted prior to their use.  DOE intends to award a five-year follow-on contract to ATI.  The contract will include a twelve-month ba se period and four twelve-month option periods. ATI possesses unique experience and expertise derived from experience in HEPA filter inspection and testing and currently has all facilities, equipment, materials, documents, and experienced personnel necessary for the performance of work in accordance with the requirements of the SOW.   ATI is the only known organization to provide the HEPA filter testing and inspection services required in the SOW to the Department.  It is deemed appropriate to award a fixed-price contract on an other than full and open competitive basis.  Only one responsible source is available and no other types of services will satisfy the needs of the Department.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research intends to execute a modification to add additional funds to an existing contract on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) awarded  to Vanderbilt University on September 23, 2005 on a competitive basis.  The purpose of this modification is to increase the level of funding in the Vanderbilt University contract to allow the contractor to increase their level of effort to perform the increasing numbers of drug safety studies needed within the original scope of work.  The following studies have been identified as serious drug safety issues requiring additional funds for studying expeditiously: Study 1. Medications for ADHD and Risk of Serious Cardiovascular Disease in Adults:  Addition of Stroke Endpoint:  For the Medications for ADHD and Risk of Serious Cardiovascular Disease in Adults:  Addition of Stroke Endpoint, Vanderbilt University completed an FDA-sponsored feasibility study in which they were determined to have an appropriate number of drug users and outcomes to allow for pooling of their data with other sites (also completing feasibility studies) to conduct an in-depth study.  Phase I of the in-depth study included the analysis of automated data.  Phase II of the study was initiated with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) as a co-sponsor.  The adult portion of the study was launched in this phase to investigate risk of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death associated with drugs used to treat ADHD.  Vanderbilt University shall complete the work associated with Phase II which includes visiting sites, pulling records and adjudicating events.  All electronically identified strokes in adults shall require confirmation.  Reviewers will confirm the diagnosis from the medical record, and will identify potential exclusions due to other diagnoses. An Events Adjudication Committee (AEC) will be established to make final decisions.  Study 2. Combined Hormonal Contraceptives (CHC) and Risk of Thromboembolic Events:  The objective of the CHC Study is to evaluate use of contraceptive products in a population of new and prevalent users to assess the public health impact and patterns of use that could place a woman at greater risk for a thromboembolic event and/or death.  The large number of Ortho Evra users available for study at Vanderbilt University, as well as the large number of contraceptive users identified in the feasibility study, provide us with a valuable opportunity to assess this important public health concern.  The initial phase (Phase I) of this study will consist of an incidence analysis of thrombotic and thromboembolic events (TTE) and death for all qualifying members based on claims data confirmed with medical record review.  Study 3.  Medication Use in Pregnancy Study, Vanderbilt University shall develop and maintain an integrated dataset that shall be used to study medication use from conception through delivery (pregnancy) and associated birth outcomes.  Vanderbilt University is well equipped to fulfill the five main tasks of the study:  1. Maternal-infant record linkage of all women delivering an infant between 2001 and 2007 (or the most recent date available); 2. Linkage to birth certificate data, infants delivered between 2001 and 2007 (or the most recent date available); 3. Validation of data elements in datasets; 4. Linkage to other databases; 5. Annual update of maternal-infant files / linkage to birth certificate data.  Vanderbilt University investigators have extensive experience in the use of automated databases to evaluate patient safety issues, including medication use during pregnancy, studies of birth outcomes related to prenatal exposure to medications, and other research using automated data.  The volume of studies that need to be conducted through this contract has greatly increased since award, due to an increased awareness within FDA of potential drug safety issues that can be studied.  There has also been increasing awareness of these types of resources and their value by those outside of FDA, such as the Institute of Medicine and Congress.  Recent legislation, Section 905(A)(4) of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA), mandates expansion of these resources for the purpose of providing timely assessments of drug safety data.  Therefore, CDER must continue to work with the Vanderbilt University to conduct study analyses to the benefit of the publics health; respond expeditiously to urgent public safety concerns; provide a mechanism for collaborative pharmacoepidemiological research designed to test hypotheses, particularly those arising from suspected adverse reactions reported to FDA; and Enable rapid access to U.S. population-based data sources to ensure public safety when necessary.  This is not a Request for Proposals.   No Solicitations will be issued. However, sources interested in this requirement must provide statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine if the requirement of this synopsis can be met.  A determination by the Government to compete this procurement based on responses from this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   A modification to the contract will be executed on or after August 13, 2008.

Description of Work: The Helena National Forest intends to issue a solicitation for the construction of Continental Divide Trail # 337 (approximately 6 miles of new trail construction).  The trail will be constructed to hiker, pack and saddle standards. Tread width will be 30 inches. All aspects of new trail construction will be included in this project. Clearing and grubbing, excavation, turnpikes, switchbacks, climbing turns, grade reversals and ditching are all included in this project. Grade dips and grade reversals will be incidental to new tread excavation. Grade dips are a pay item for trail restoration.  Due to the length of new construction and short working season, machine construction will be a requirement on this project.  Terrain is not exceptionally rough but there will be a considerable amount of rock that will slow construction.

<DESC>The scope of this contract is to provide expert riparian fisheries consultation services to the San Dimas Technology and Development Center (SDTDC).  These services will support the development, installation and monitoring of a new type of automated fish detection and counting device, hereafter referred to as FDCD.

The FDCD generates benign electric fields in a narrow swath across the width of a stream and measures changes in those fields to detect the presence, size, and direction of travel of fish swimming over the sensor.  The device requires less site modification, consumes less power, and offers finer resolution than comparable equipment.

The FDCD is transitioning from the lab prototype stage of development to a field prototype.  The FDCD vendor is not experienced in fisheries management, and will modify the lab prototype design to meet general requirements for field installations.  The successful offeror shall design site-specific installations for two field prototypes, based on information gathered from observing the field installation of the first prototype and communicating with the FDCD vendor, SDTDC, and local contacts for the additional sites.  The successful offeror shall then prepare the additional FDCDs for installation, travel to the site, install the FDCDs, and submit a project report.

<DESC>Purpose and Need
There is a long-standing gap in data needed to understand how freight flows through the Marine Transportation System (MTS), especially domestic freight.  This cripples strategis planning and seriously limits identification of optimal Marine Highway corridors and projects.  The Maritime Administration is committed to the Marine Transportation System National Advisory Council (MTSNAC) to identify these gaps, specifically in domestic freight data.  We also lead the Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) Data Integrated Acton Team which is also grapping with the same issues.  To meet these obligations, we need a comprehensive study to assess gaps between government and private sector freight data, develop long term solution and develop ways to close the gaps in the short term.
Project Approach
The Maritime Administration (MARAD) will retain a contractor to perform an overall assessment of the Government resources on marine data, identify gaps in these resources, and develop ways to close the gaps.  This work will build on the momentum of previous studies done for the Department of Transportation and the Maritime Administration.
In addition to providing the capability to perform ad-hoc analysis as needed, there are six major areas that a robust data collection system needs to address.  These are:
1.  Cost-benefit analysis2.  Forecasting3.  Investment decisions, including funding and financing4.  National policy including goals, standards, and performance measures5.  Rules, regulations, and legislative proposals6.  Economic Impact Assessment
Work Plan
The contractor will assist in the following Task Areas:
I..  Assessing gaps between government-wide marine freight data needs and current marine trade and freight data collection efforts --determining the gaps between data that is currently collected and data that needs to be collected.  Subtasks include:    a.  Inventory current data collecton efforts    b.  Review previous efforts to define data needs    c.  Interview key stakeholders to update data needs statements    d.  Develop "data gaps" analysis and evaluations    e.  Develop proposed solutions and recommendations
II.  Mapping long term needs for improving marine freight data collection (electronic manifest development, development of cost data, etc.).  This will focue on the respective roles of various public and private sector stakeholders, the potential to modify and/or integrate existing programs, and the potential need for new programs.
III.  Examining short term options for improving marine and trade freight dta.  This will focus on successful near-term implementation of data improvement measures, primarily addressing collection, use, integration, and dissemination.
IV.  Determinining steps that must be taken to adjust existing "products/resources" to better meet stakeholders" marine freight data needs, and for each step, assigning specific timelines and responsibilities.
The overall effort will assist in identifying wide-ranging freight policy analysis needs, and a process for ensuring that data collection efforts satisfy stakeholders" freight data needs.
Schedule and Deliverables
A draft findings and recommendations report will be produced within 2 months.  It is expected that the contractor will submit a working draft of the report to the Maritime Administration for comment by October 15, 2008.  Comments will be provided to the contractor by October 31, 2008.  Comments will be reflected in a final report due to the Maritime Administration on November 30, 2008.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure as a sole source the brand Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-4000 System with FujiFilm Medical Systems U.S.A.; 419 West Ave.; Stamford, CT 06902.</p>
<p>The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  Contractor shall provide one (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, by August 12, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed or emailed to: Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at marinome@mail.nih.gov or fax to 301-402-4513.  It is the vendors' responsibility to ensure all questions have been received in the contracting office.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference: NCI-80143-MM on all correspondence.</p>
<p>Part I: Background information and description of requirements:</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) is currently using various types of X-ray and non-digital systems for data collection and storage.  These images then have to be scanned if the data is to be analyzed.  Film can easily be lost or fade over time leading to the irreversible loss of data from experiments. From a technical standpoint, X-ray film saturates very quickly making it difficult to obtain good images within the linear range of the film's sensitivity.  The LAS-4000 is a luminescent image analyzer with very high sensitivity to collect image data, digitize it and allow direct analysis.  It will also replace traditional less sensitive X-ray film.  The instrument will be housed in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at NCI for use by all its members.  It will allow digital acquisition and long term storage of data on the LMB servers that are backed up daily at NCI.</p>
<p><br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:</p>
<p>Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition:</p>
<p>Statute:  This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers   may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</p>
<p>No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.</p>
<p>Justification:</p>
<p>FujiFilm Medcial Systems in the USA which distributes this instrument from the Fuji Corporation in Japan is the only source known to the NCI that can satisfy the requirements for this instrument. The Fuji cooled CCD camera has the highest resolution and sensitivity on the market.  It generates about 6.3 M pixel densities (3072 x 2048) and provides the sharpest images we have seen in the tests.  The camera can also capture wavelengths from 312-710 nm a UV to infrared range and the software that comes with the instrument is the simplest to use and runs on the Mac computers our laboratories are equipped with. Only the proposed source can furnish the services, having alternative equipment would not provide us with the best results as we have seen in our tests and there is no other known supplier than FujiFilm.</p>
<p>The following salient characteristics apply to the LAS-4000:</p>
<p>1.	Must be compatible with the LAS-3000 because the laboratory has data collected using the LAS-3000. For consistency of results, the continuing studies must be done with the same type of instrument.</p>
<p>2.	Camera sensitivity must be maximal for detecting low signals and be capable of generating octagonal 6.3 Million pixel density for a 3072 x 2048 resolution array.</p>
<p>3.	Camera detection range of wavelengths: 312-710 nm (UV to Infrared range).</p>
<p>4.	The Image Capture system must run on a Mac platform since the great majority of LMB is Mac based.</p>
<p>5.	Analysis software must run on the Apple operating system, because the laboratory uses Apple computers exclusively.</p>
<p>6.	The system must have adjustable shelf positioning for imaging different thickness western, southern, and northern blots, mice, and various types of culture plate.</p>
<p>7.	The system must be expandable to include mouse imaging capability.</p>

 Summary: 
The above laboratory equipment is essential to NIAMSs continued research efforts:
Background
Research in the Section focuses on the cell biology of skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle is made of uniquely organized large multinucleated cells, built through successive developmental changes in cell morphology and subcellular organization. We are currently particularly interested in the organization of the Golgi complex (GC). One of the important functions of the GC is the targeting of membrane proteins. This is an essential function in a cell with distinct membrane domains. Muscle fibers have several membrane domains: the plasma membrane, the T-tubules, the neuromuscular junction, the myotendinous junctions, to which proteins must be specifically targeted. Some of these domains extend at large distances from the nuclei. Instead of compact Golgi complexes associated with the nuclei, muscle fibers have thousands of small Golgi complexes dispersed throughout the fibers. We have shown that their distribution is fiber type-specific and regulated by the patterned contractile activity of the muscle fiber. Although the organization of the GC in muscle appears specific to this tissue, we have shown that it relies on principles common to all mammalian cells linking the Golgi complex, the microtubule cytoskeleton and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 

Our present work focuses on understanding how the GC changes are regulated during muscle development and are caused by contractile activity. Experiments in progress include the relative localization of GC, ER exit sites and centrosomal proteins by immunofluorescence, immunogold EM, and by observation of GFP-tagged proteins in live cells, as well as investigations of the signaling pathway(s) involved. We are currently investigating whether microtubule stabilization, which takes place during muscle differentiation, plays a role in the relocation of the GC. We are also using transgenic mice lacking cytoskeletal proteins to probe their role.
As part of our research on muscle cytoskeleton, a single fiber from a mouse Tibialis Anterior muscle was stained with antibodies against the proteins syne (cytoskeleton) and caveolin-3 (cell surface), and counterstained with Hoechst, a fluorescent dye that labels nuclei. The fiber was photographed in the Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. This image is the superposition of a transmitted light image of the fiber (white) and of the immunofluorescence images (red for syne, green for caveolin-3, blue for the nuclei). The blood vessels that surrounded the muscle fiber in the muscle have been removed but have left ditches that appear as sinuous red channels.

Background: 
 Musculoskeletal diseases such as arthritis constitute the major debilitating diseases in adult humans. To better understand the causes of this disease the research in my laboratory is centered on understanding the genetic basis of cartilage formation and homeostasis. Our goals are to identify genes that will aid in the formation of cartilage in cell culture and to use this newly formed cartilage in a tissue-engineering context to replace the worn out cartilage resulting from osteoarthritis. Towards this end we use adult human mesenchymal stem cells as a cellular source to form cartilage in cell culture. In concert with this process, we have begun to utilize a genetic engineering approach to modify existing cartilage proteins, such as the transcription factor Sox 9 and the extracellular matrix factor cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), so that we will be able to generate cartilage more efficiently in cell culture and that the cartilage formed will be better able to function when implanted into the body.
Another ongoing project is to utilize genetic screens to identify genes that will help cartilage be more resistant to the factors that cause arthritis. These genetic screens have never been used to date in an orthopaedic or cartilage biology setting and therefore have enormous potential to aid in the discovery of new genes that will benefit halt the onset of osteoarthritis.
Finally, we are setting out to explore the protective role of cartilage proteins in cancer. We are testing the hypothesis that certain cartilage proteins such as COMP limit the growth of cancer cells. In this way there may be an inverse relationship between arthritis and cancer such that the former may protect against the latter. Our initial investigations suggest that such a relationship may exist.

NIAMS owns a Zeiss PALM 1 laser micro-dissection catapult system which is 100% compatible with the Upgrade MicroBeam C 355.  It is used for the manipulation of micro-dissection of living, frozen or paraffin-archived tissue for the collection of living cells, organelles, macromolecules (such as RNA) and biomaterials (i.e. particulates and wear debris). Zeiss is the manufacturer of two existing scientific instruments that provides micro-dissection of muscle and cell interaction analysis in the NIAMSs laboratory; therefore, the upgrade must be 100% compatible. The upgrade system will allow the government to continue on-going projects such as tissue specific gene expression in would heal models during distraction posteogenesis and impact induced osteoarthrosis. The use of the Zeiss Laser is also merited given the extensive experience the lab has with the particular PALM laser.  Furthermore, purchasing an upgrade model alleviates the cost of training associated with a different manufactures laser.

a)	Model 626-CRYOTRANSGFER  SINGLE TILT HOLDER
 Summary: 

The above laboratory equipment is essential to NIAMSs continued research efforts:
Background:
The laboratory equipment is essential and vital for the current clinical research of Dynamics of Herpes Simplex Virus Capsid
Maturation Visualized by Time-Lapsed Cryo-EM, which is led and directed by these NIAMS researchers. J. Bernard Heymann, Naiqian Cheng, William W. Newcomb, 
Benes L.Trus, Jay C. Brown and Alasdair C. Steven

The capsid of the herpes simplex virus initially assembles as a precursor procapsid that matures via a massive conformational change of its 192 MDa surface shell. This shell is composed of hexamers and pentamers of VP5 coordinated by heterotrimers of VP19c and VP23. The structural transition, which stabilizes the fragile procapsid, is facilitated by the viral protease which releases the interaction between the shell and the underlying scaffold: however, protease-deficient procapsids mature spontaneously albeit slowly in vitro. We have studied procapsid maturation as a time-resolved process by monitoring this reaction by cryo-electron microscopy. The resulting images were sorted into 17 distinct classes and three-dimensional density maps were calculated for each. Ordered into a time series, these data yielded molecular movies of procapsid maturation. A single major convulsion takes place at stages 8-9, preceded by relatively subtle adjustments in the pattern of interactions and followed by similarly small aftershocks. The primary mechanism underlying maturation is relative rotations of domains of VP5.
The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the Cryotransfer holder must be 100% compatible with the governments existing  Gatan model 900.60ck SmartSet cooling control unit and 100% compatible with the governments Gatan Temperature Control modules with seven-pin configuration. Gatan Inc. is the manufacturer of the aforementioned and therefore, the Model 626-CRYOTRANSFER SINGLE TILT HOLDER must be compatible to fit existing instruments and parts. Gatan is the only known system that meets the Governments minimum needs.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF WORK:This contract is for radio infrastructure work to support the transition to narrowband radio frequencies as mandated by Congress.  There are three main work elements and two options:1.  Marblemount cache: Furnish and install a 20' x 30' heated and insulated storage building. Foundation shall be reinforced slab on grade with 10-foot-high 2"x6" insulated walls, painted T1-11 wood siding, and a 4/12 slope insulated wood truss roof with standing seam metal roofing and gutters. Interior shall be painted gypsum wallboard with a sealed concrete floor. Building shall include doors and windows for access, lighting and ventilation. Provide fluorescent fixtures and outlets along with electrical service, which must be brought from the nearest transformer approximately 250 lf. Install propane heating, including tank, with a ceiling-mounted fan and heater. No water plumbing required.2.  Marblemount radio tower: Furnish and install a SSV 100' Rohn tower with foundation and climbing safety system.  Remove and dispose of the existing 90-foot radio antenna tower, guys, and tower foundation once new tower and equipment are fully operational.3.  Finney Ridge infrastructure: Contractor shall construct a steel-reinforced concrete pad, and furnish and install a prefabricated 8' X 8' x 8' communication shelter as manufactured by BMIL International thereon.  Furnish and install solar panels, batteries, and regulators.  Install NPS-furnished radio equipment within shelter.Option A.  Finney Ridge radio tower: Furnish and install a new self-supporting Rohn SSV radio tower with a 60-foot mast section and antenna system with lightning suppressor and ground ring.Option B.  Move Marblemount radio equipment: Once new tower and Marblemount communications center are complete, move some existing and some new NPS-furnished radio equipment onto tower and into communications center.  Make all connections and test for full function.
BACKGROUND:This contract represents Phase II of our transition to narrowband radio frequency technology.  Items 2 and 3 and Options A and B represent necessary infrastructure for the new radio system.  Most of the sensitive radio equipment will be housed in the communications center at Marblemount, which is currently too small.   During this winter NPS employees will expand/remodel the communications center to accommodate the new radio equipment.  The expansion of the communications center will displace the current Marblemount cache (which stores search and rescue gear).  Item 1 of this contract will provide a new storage site for the cache.
SCHEDULE:NPS expects to award this project in mid-September.  Desired starting and completion dates are:1. Marblemount cache - Start as soon as possible after award.  Complete by 12/15/08.  2. Marblemount radio tower - Start when mutually convenient.  Complete by 5/15/09.  3. Finney Ridge infrastructure - Start this fall or next spring, as mutually agreed; due to its higher elevation the site and/or access road may be snow-covered and inaccessible for much of the winter.  Complete by 5/15/09.Option A. Finney Ridge radio tower - same as Finney Ridge infrastructure.Option B. Move Marblemount radio equipment - Start as scheduled by NPS next spring.  Complete by 5/15/09.
LOCATION:Marblemount is a small town located on State Route 20 approximately 45 miles east of Interstate 5 in northwestern Washington.  The SAR cache and radio tower sites are located at the NPS ranger station, within 2 miles of "downtown" Marblemount.  There are a few restaurants, convenience stores, and lodging options in town.  The Finney Ridge work site is located south of the town of Concrete and is accessed by paved and gravel roads (approximate travel time to the work site from Concrete is one hour).  There are several restaurants and lodging establishments, a grocery store, doctor office, and other amenities in Concrete.  Cellular phones do not work at the Marblemount project site, and may not work at Finney Ridge.  Information and maps are available at www.nps.gov/noca .
SOLICITATION DETAILSThis action is a best value procurement reserved for certified HUBZone business concerns.  The NAICS code is 237130 and the small business size standard is $33.5 million, average annual gross receipts for the past three years.

<DESC>The Fleet Industrial Supply Center (FISC), Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to procure Genetic Breast Cancer Testing for the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC), Laboratory Department, Bethesda, Maryland and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), Washington DC.  NNMC and WRAMC intend to acquire 46 Oncotype DX test for highly specialized blood testing designed to determine the probability of developing breast cancer based on an individuals family history.  These unique tests will be used to quantify the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence in women with certain specific sets of circumstances specifically newly diagnosed, stage I or II to better determine future treatment plans.  The Oncotype DX tests form the foundation of post operative care for these types of patients.  These tests will allow NNMC/WRAMC to aggressively treat patients based on the likelihood of a cancer recurrence.  FISCs intent is to process this procurement on a sole source basis to Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA, because Genomic Health is the only known source providing this type of test. This test is unique as it is the only one on the market that analyzes 21 separate genes to provide a comprehensive risk quantification of cancer recurrence.  FISCs intent is to issue a firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR 12 (Commercial Items) and FAR 13.5 (Test Program for Certain Commercial Items) procedures.  The Period of Performance is from 01 October 2008 through 30 September 2009, plus four one-year options ending 30 September 2013, if all options are exercised.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested offerors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a capability statement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received by 7 August 2008 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<a href="mailto:caryn.mcgraw@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC><BR>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI); Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS); Instrumentation Management Office (IMO) in partnership with the Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Yuma Test Center (YTC), and White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) is seeking industry information on available products and technologies to further define/refine the requirements and the acquisition approach for the Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP).  The draft RRRP Test Capabilities Requirements Document (TCRD) is available upon request.  Once the TCRD is approved, all the performance specifications and Statement of Work (SOW) will be derived from the approved TCRD.  Sources sought may address available products and technologies to produce components or a complete capability to provide new test capabilities to fully support all current and emerging test customer requirements while simultaneously reducing the overall radar fleet life cycle costs.  It is critical that these new test capabilities reduce operational cost through remote control operation and smaller crew size requirements.  It is desired that this system be used to replace as many of the current range radars and perform in the four radar zone as defined in the attached document. The RRRP will be a comprehensive solution to EPG, YPG, ad WSMR.  PM ITTS is the lead for the acquisition of this capability.   <BR><BR>Background:<BR><BR>Interaction with Industry will be a multi-step process.  Step one is the release of the complete Request for Information (RFI).  It is the Government intent to conduct an Industry Day at Orlando, Florida on the 14 August 2008. The intent of the Industry Day will be to clearly present the Governments requirements to potential bidders. Once the Industry Day is complete, Industry will have the opportunity to participate in one on one interaction with the customer during the afternoon of the 14 August 2008 and all day during the 15 August 2008.  Responses to the RFI will be completed 60 days after the Industry Day, specifically 14 October 2008 or sooner.  Step two, if required, will be the opportunity of potential bidders to tour the ranges during the week of 18  29 August 2008.  The range tour request must be submitted to the Point of Contact (POC) by COB 15 August 2008.<BR><BR>The Governments intention is to better understand the current state-of-the-art and to determine the best acquisition approach.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas received from industry.  This RFI is an expression of the Governments interest only and does not obligate the Government to pay for the requested information nor respond to any submissions.  Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is submitted, it should be appropriately marked.  There is no limit on your formal white paper submission include cover letter and white paper.  In addition, you may include up to five attachments that consists of pre-printed commercial brochures or sales literature.  Electronic submissions are strongly encouraged.  Electronic responses shall be in MS Word or Adobe PDF format.  Please submit responses to PEOSTRI, ATTN: SFAE-STRI-KL (Mrs. Caryn McGraw), 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or e-mail caryn.mcgraw@us.army.mil. Please include Ms. Lorraine C. Castillo, Project Director (lorraine.castillo@us.army.mil) on the cc:line.  Information must be received no later than 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time on 14 October 2008.  Point of contact is Ms. Caryn McGraw at (407) 208-3419 or caryn.mcgraw@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>Detailed Requirements:<BR><BR>PM ITTS is looking for suppliers who can provide radar platforms that may be used alone or in conjunction with other systems to provide the required capability.  Technologies of specific interest include radar systems such as imaging or non-imaging electro-optical systems to provide the required capability. Commercial and non-development solutions are preferred where the end-system would provide the capabilities stated above.  PM ITTS is also interested in suppliers that can provide a completely integrated capability.  All respondents are asked to provide the following:<BR><BR>1.	A technical description of the potential solution or complete capability.  The description should answer the following:<BR>a.	What part of the overall capability your solution addresses?<BR>b.	Does your system meet the remote operability requirements? If not, what modifications will your system require to meet the threshold and/or objectives?<BR>c.	How does your solution work?  What are its limits?<BR>d.	What are the physical dimensions and weight of your solution?  How much power does it use?  <BR>e.	How effectively has your solution been used in similar range test and evaluation requirements or outdoor applications?<BR>f.	What evidence exists that your solution is applicable if it has not been used in similar in range requirements?<BR>g.	How mature is your system?  Is it new development?  Does a prototype exist?  Is it similar to previous successful developments?  Is it an extension or evolution of an existing product?  Is it already in production?<BR>h.

The Government will accept all or none of the comments provided to the draft TCRD?<BR>6.	Identification of critical technical/cost/and schedule drivers.<BR>7.	A description of the contractors familiarization of TENA requirements?<BR>8.	A detailed approach to logistics management?<BR>9.	Any history of sustainability costs of the proposed system solution? Will the contractor be able to demonstrate a quantitatively reduction in operational cost and smaller crew size requirements?<BR>10.	Identification of any areas needing science and technology development?<BR>11.	Recommendation on acquisition approach.<BR>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The SHC 120K requirement is for a self-powered, thermoelectric heater that will provide soldiers operating in basic, cold and extreme cold environments with a safe, portable, lightweight, multi-fueled, forced-air heater in the 120,000 BTU/hr range.  The SHC 120K must operate outside the tent and support applications for heating Modular General Purpose Tent System (MGPTS), Tent Extendable Modular Personnel (TEMPER) complexes,  and other applications without the need for an external power supply (i.e., field generator).  The heater must burn multiple diesel fuels and JP-8, operate in extreme cold temperatures down to -60oF and be equipped with a remote intelligent control box that informs the heaters operator of a problem and how to easily resolve the problem.  The SHC 120Ks unique, self-powering capability will enable the heating system to be smaller (less than 30 cubic feet), lighter (less than 400 lbs), more mobile, versatile, reliable, efficient, and be an ideal match for meeting the future battle field requirements to reduce the logistic burden of supplying fuel and power to the field. The SHC 120K Performance Specification will be available  on or about  August 08.  The Government intends to award one (1) Firm-Fixed Price Requirements type contract with a base period of two (2) years and three (3) one (1) year ordering periods, not to exceed 60 months. The Base Ordering Period will consist of an estimated quantity of 20 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units for First Article Testing and Tech Data Packages.  The three (3) year ordering period will be an estimated quantity of 300 heaters per year. This acquisition will be conducted on a full and open basis.  As part of its proposal, each Offeror will be required to submit a Prototype Demonstration Model (PDM) for Government evaluation purposes.  Firms will not be reimbursed for any costs associated with proposal preparation. The RFP will post on or about August 2008 on FedBizOps.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice / Draft Request for Proposals is for informational purposes only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS OR BIDS.<BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, requests manufacturers of diesel fired, electrical power generators to provide notice of capacity to manufacture and sell commercially, 2500KW generators that are certified by the generator manufacturer to meet EPA Tier II (or better) emission requirements. Further details below.  <BR>Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate design and acquisition decisions. After review of the responses to this announcement, the Government will utilize this information to direct its future design efforts. No separate solicitation will be produced for the sole purpose of acquiring said generators; however future construction contracts may require generators to be purchased that meet the said requirements. <BR>NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. <BR>All interested manufacturers who respond with a commitment to meet requirements, and provided the Government chooses to mandate use of this particular design feature, will have their contact information passed to future construction contractors (hired under U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District) for construction projects that utilize these particular requirements. This notice is to assist the Baltimore District, Corps of Engineers in determining potential sources and to obtain industry comment on a possible acquisition decision. This sources sought announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. This sources sought is intended solely to obtain information, and at no time is the Government required to award, solicit, procure or show any preference toward any manufacturers or product. <BR><BR>Point of Contact Comments are to be sent either via email to edward.w.hall@usace.army.mil or by hard copy to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 10 S. Howard Street, Suite 7000, Baltimore MD 21201-1715 no later than 03:00 p.m. eastern standard time August 29th, 2008. The technical POC (where questions related to clarifying technical issues about this document can be directed) is Ms. Justina Nesbitt, reachable via email at Justina.t.Nesbitt@usace.army.mil<BR>NO APPOINTMENTS OR TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. <BR>Product Description<BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District has plans to construct a project, beginning in 2009, utilizing approximately three (3) 2500KW generators that meet EPA Tier II certification. The Government is interested in finding out what manufacturers will have available generators that meet these requirements. Note that the government is only looking for manufacturers (not vendors or retailers) to respond who currently, or can assure that they will by 2011, produce generators that meet these requirements and below specifications. Manufacturers must be willing to certify that they meet these standards with a product that will be sold commercially with regular availability; in other words, special order equipment that will have a premium price markup (above 20% over manufacturers comparable non-Tier II equipment) for the Tier II certification is not acceptable. In order to claim certification, the manufacturer must meet any and all requirements (if any) by EPA or other appropriate agency for affixing the Tier II certification label. For example, if the EPA requires that manufacturers send test data to them for validation prior to advertising Tier II compliant, than this must be done prior to our purchase. <BR><BR>Due to the size and weight of the equipment, the manufacturer must vend, through their own sales staff or other authorized sales persons, their generators to the Greater Washington DC/ Baltimore MD area.<BR>Since the Tier II certification is relatively new, the Government will accept the manufacturers good faith statement that they will meet the Tier II requirements and have on the market the generators by mid 2011. Manufacturers please refrain from making any such claims if you are not absolutely sure you will meet the requirements by the said date.<BR><BR>This product is exempt from the Buy American Act, thus international manufacturers are welcome to respond. Note that they must be able to vend as noted above.<BR>Any manufacturers who respond must have been manufacturing generators of similar size and performance (though not necessarily Tier II) for at least three (3) years and have a good track record of performance, and be able to show that their products have been used successfully in the commercial/industrial environment for at least three (3) years.<BR><BR>Each component manufacturer for the diesel generator shall have a minimum of 3 years experience in the manufacture, assembly and sale of components used with stationary diesel engine-generator sets for commercial and industrial use. The engine-generator set manufacturer/assembler shall have a minimum of 3 years experience in the manufacture, assembly and sale of stationary diesel engine-generator sets for commercial and industrial use.<BR>All manufacturers who respond please provide the government with the following:<BR>"	Statement of compliance with Tier II, or statement assuring future compliance by said date<BR>"	Documentation, if any, showing compliance with Tier II regulations and standards<BR>"	Statement of compliance with additional specs located below, and identify any areas of non-compliance with specs (other than Tier II) by clearly explaining non-compliance areas.<BR>"	Current price or target price<BR>"	Product cut sheet or specs, if available, or any available tentative information on the product if being developed<BR>"	Date available if currently being sold or tentative date of availability<BR>"	Estimated lead time on ordering<BR>"	Contact information<BR>Below represents specifications for generator.

<DESC>The VA Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC) intends to negotiate a sole source buy with Luminetx Corporation, of Memphis, TN for a Vein Viewer System, in connection with mission objectives of the Surgery Department, at the Edward Hines Jr., VA Hospital, Hines, Illinois.To the best of our knowledge Luminetx Corporation. is the only manufacturer of a system that provides a product that has (a)  a combination of near-infrared light and patented technologies to image vascular structures, thus allowing physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals to clearly see accessible vasculature (or lack thereof) in real time, directly on the surface of the skin; (b) projects the image of the vasculature directly onto the patient's skin, focusing attention on the patient during the procedure rather than on a secondary monitor; and (c) does not cause cross-contamination of patients because there is no contact between the patient and the Vein Viewer, providing ease in the determination of arteries from veins if one or both fall within the viewing depth employed by the technology, from the surface of the skin to approximately 6 to 8 mm deep. This procurement is being conducted in accordance FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  The resulting contract will be firm fixed price and the NAICS Code is 334510.This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitations documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored.  However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements aforementioned, then firms must furnish detailed information about its products and or services, as well as references from other customers who are using these products and or services.  This information must be submitted to the Contracting Officer within (8) calendar days from the date of this synopsis publication.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement, to include FDA approval/compliance certification.  Information must be sent to the Contracting Officer, VAMC GLAC, 5000 W. National Ave Bldg. 5, Milwaukee WI 53295 or via fax to (414) 902-5440.  Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the GLAC will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Luminetx Corporation.

<DESC>DescriptionThe NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) has directed the Marshall SpaceFlight Center (MSFC), through the Lunar Precursor Robotic Program (LPRP) Office, toimplement an activity to provide, integrate and/or develop of a suite of lunar mapping,modeling, visualization and analysis products that support NASAs Constellation Program(CxP) and other related lunar exploration activities, including the planning, design,development, test and operations associated with the establishment of a lunar outpost,sortie missions and crewed operations on the lunar surface.  The LMMP plans to accomplishthis activity by implementing an integrated lunar surface visualization system thatprovides the lunar exploration community with access to and visualization of lunarmapping, modeling and analysis data, products and tools.  It is envisioned that useraccess to this visualization system by CxP and other users will be through a single,consistent, intuitive and easy-to-use NASA internet portal.  The system will provideaccess to appropriately defined portions of the highly distributed collection ofavailable lunar data, products and tools in the background and transparently to the user. The LMMP will focus predominately on providing access to data sets and productsresulting from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and Lunar CRater Observation andSensing Satellite (LCROSS) missions, but may also utilize historical lunar data (e.g.,Apollo, Lunar Orbiter, Clementine, Lunar Prospector, Earth-based observations, etc.), andinternational lunar mission data (e.g., Kaguya, Chandrayaan, etc.), as available andappropriate, to meet specific near-term product, product type and/or product resolutionand accuracy needs.Hence, the NASA/MSFC is issuing this RFI to conduct a market survey of the planetaryscience, academic, commercial, government and other interested communities to obtain anunderstanding of currently existing planetary surface visualization systems, geographicinformation systems, other relevant and/or related software elements, components, tools,data systems and architectures, etc. that could potentially be integrated into thedevelopment and delivery of such a lunar surface visualization system by the LMMP.  Theterm existing implies that these resources are currently operational and available inthe commercial, private, education, government or public domains and that would requireonly minimal modification, if any, to be incorporated into the development andestablishment of above stated capabilities.  It is a goal of LMMP to make as much of theunderlying source code and products available to the public as practical.  However, it isrecognized that this may not be possible for some commercial software and products thatmight be considered.The following top-level goals, constraints and needs have been established for the LMMPin the development of a Lunar Surface Visualization System, and is provided here in orderto provide additional context of the scope of the LMMP:	Emphasize adherence to open standards and standardized data and interface formats(eg. OGC, geotiff, JPEG2000, Planetary Data System)	Provide a visualization system and related data and analysis products that are ingeneral easily extensible and adaptable to interface with other software applications(eg. NASA mission operations software & design tools, Matlab, ESRI Arc), other analysistools, simulation or computer systems and/or to provide data and/or output data/filescompatible with those systems	Provide a system that is easily accessible, usable and meets the needs of theConstellation Program, while providing utility to other users in science and educationcommunities, and the general public	All relevant data sets and products used in the system will be geo-registered tothe same lunar control network.  This will have been done previously by the dataoriginator or by the LMMP prior to use by the system.	Provide access to the visualization, manipulation and/or analysis of thefollowing lunar supplied data products/sets/types:o	Global and local visible image base mapping datao	Topographic mapping datao	Surface digital elevation models (DEM)o	Surface slope & hazard mapso	Lunar lighting mapping and/or model datao	Lunar temperature mapping and/or model datao	Global lunar gravity modelo	Global mineralogical and elemental abundance mapping data	Provide a system and/or tools that allow digital overlays and/or fusion of lunarmaps/models depicting appropriate interaction of the user specified/generated parametersof interest.This RFI is for information, acquisition and development planning purposes only and isnot to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractualagreement, nor will the Government pay for the information requested.  This is NOT arequest for proposals or notice of solicitation - no solicitation related to this RFIcurrently exists.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>POC: Ulises Rivero, (305) 361-4438 <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SUBJECT: The Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), located in Miami, Florida intend to Charter a small boat to conduct a long term study of the heat flux across 27 degrees North latitude in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">AOML is currently conducting a long term study of the heat flux across 27 degrees north latitude in the Atlantic. As part of this study the total heat transport of the Gulf Stream in the Straits of Florida needs to be measured. To provide this measurement a series of two one-day cruises (typically) are made. A small boat is used to deploy a dropsonde at nine locations between Palm Beach, Florida and West end, Grand Bahamas Island. At each site the average current and temperature structure of the water are measured to compute the total heat being transported north by the Gulf Stream. Therefore, AOML must</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">Charter a small boat approximately 8 to 10 days per year for these cruises. In order to minimize transit time to the work area and complete the cruises within one day, the small</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">Boat must be based near the location of the dropsonde sites. In addition, since it is scientifically crucial to make these cruises simultaneously with the arrival of the AX-7 high density vessel, multiple boats must be available for use in case of mechanical breakdowns or scheduling conflicts. The boats</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">must both of sufficient size to carry all the AOML equipment needed for the work and they must have the range and speed necessary to make the crossing and perform the work at the nine sites within one day. A survey of the Palm Beach area was conducted and the Sailfish Marina was the only facility that satisfied these criteria. They are the closest marina to the west end of the line of deployment sites and there are more than four boats based there that could be used for our work. Therefore, the Sailfish Marina was selected for this work. The government knows of no other company able to supply this type of equipment besides Sailfish Marina. Only Sailfish Marina will meet planned scientific data collection goals.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">Firms who believe they provided this type of service that will meet all the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>requirements specified herein, including form fit, and function, and delivery must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide the supply and satisfy the Government's needs. Along with descriptive literature on the equipment being offered must be provided. In addition shall include name, telephone number and address of concerns for which you have furnished this type of equipment previously. Interested parties must respond within (10) days after publication of this notice. If no affirmative responses are received, the government intends to issue a purchase order to Sailfish Marina through the commercial acquisition process.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">The Central Region Administrative Division (CRAD), requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: <a href="http://www.ccr.gov/">http://www.ccr.gov/</a>. In order to register with the CCR offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at <a href="https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html">https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html</a> or by phone at (800) 333-0505.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The government now requires all contractors submit their Certification and Representation thru the on-line Business Partner Network (BPN). The BPN is the single source for vendor data for the federal government. Contractors should go on-line at <a href="http://www.bpn.gov/">www.bpn.gov</a>. Faxed responses can be sent to 305-361-4545, Attn: Lourdes Arteta or emailed to Lourdes.arteta@noaa.gov.</p>

INTRODUCTION

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commissions Office of Information Services.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the NRC to acquire any products or services.  The NRC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested.  Submission of a response is entirely voluntary.

BACKGROUND
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is an independent Federal agency established by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to regulate civilian use of nuclear materials.  NRCs mission is to license and regulate the Nation's civilian use of byproduct, source, and special nuclear materials to ensure adequate protection of public health and safety, promote the common defense and security, and protect the environment. 
The Office of Human Resources (OHR), Employee/Labor Relations and Worklife Branch (ELRWB) manages employee relations, labor relations and work life activities agency-wide. Develops, coordinates, and implements labor-management, employee relations, and work life policies, including but not limited to disciplinary and adverse actions, performance based actions, administrative grievance procedure, prevention of harassment, No Fear Act, requests for reasonable accommodation, labor relations, telework, and the employee assistance program. Maintains and fosters relationships with all appropriate internal offices, including, OIG, OGC, and SBCR in order to insure that all sensitive employee matters are handled in an appropriate manner. ELRWB provides day-to-day guidance and support to managers and supervisors in dealing with employee conduct and performance issues. Negotiates and administers collective bargaining agreements; conducts day-to-day interactions with the employee union including processing of grievances filed under the negotiated grievance procedure, requests for information, and all negotiations dealing with the impact and implementation of changes in working conditions affecting members of the bargaining unit. 
The Office of the General Counsel (OGC), Assistant General Counsel for Legal Counsel, Legislation, and Special Projects, assists the General Counsel in providing advice to NRC employees on ethical conduct and manages the financial disclosure and ethics training programs.  
The Office of Small Business and Civil Rights (SBCR) is responsible for the administrative processing of discrimination complaints, filed under the various civil rights statutes (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), the Rehabilitation Act, and, the Equal Pay Act of 1963), from the informal/pre-complaint stage through the formal stage. SBCR has the responsibility of monitoring EEO complaint activity to produce congressionally mandated reports under the Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002 (NO FEAR Act) and regulatory required reports to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  To comply with these legislative and Agency mandates, SBCR must provide numerous ad-hoc, monthly, quarterly, annual and multi-year reports on civil rights activity.

6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  November 2008  November  2010
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

BACKGROUND

On February 17, 2008, Kosovo declared itself to be a sovereign country and began the long road to becoming an economically viable nation with a goal of soon joining other transition countries in European Union membership.  USAIDs technical assistance will continue to help Kosovo establish the foundations for economic growth to ensure that it is able to stand on its own as a new nation.  

As background, since 1999, Kosovo has been administered as a protectorate under the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).  During 2006, the UN Special Envoy, Marti Ahtisaari, worked to craft a negotiated agreement to resolve Kosovos future status.  In early February 2007, President Ahtisaari released the draft Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement (the Ahtisaari plan) which set forth proposed terms related to a resolution of Kosovos status.  While the UN Security Council did not ratify the Ahtisaari plan, Kosovo has endorsed it; thus, its principles are still viable.  The Ahtisaari plan envisions the establishment of an International Civilian Office (ICO), which would have the mandate of ensuring that the Ahtisaari plan is properly implemented.  Currently, the ICO is in the process of staffing up, while UNMIK is reducing its presence in Kosovo.  An additional governance transition in Kosovo occurred in January 2008 when, as a result of national and municipal elections, new elected Kosovo officials assumed their positions.  Kosovos new constitution came into effect on June 15, 2008.    

Thus, USAIDs work in Kosovo is currently taking place in the context of an unparalleled transition, requiring USAID to be flexible and responsive to evolving needs.  One of USAIDs main tools for helping the citizens of Kosovo with this transition is its project entitled Economic Management for Stability and Growth (EMSG), a project under the oversight of USAIDs Economic Growth Office (EGO).  It focuses on ensuring strong implementation of policies and laws, including some that are germane to successful implementation of the Ahtisaari plan, as well as further strengthening Kosovo capacity to effectively administer key economic institutions.  It also provides assistance with strategies for Publicly-Owned Enterprises and assistance in the energy sector, given that sectors importance for Kosovos economic growth.  EMSG builds on successes already achieved to ensure that quality laws and processes are deeply embedded in institutions, so that the economic promises of the post-status era can be fulfilled for all Kosovo citizens.  

USAIDs work is implemented in a complex environment, involving not only expected actors such as other donors, international financial institutions and other multilateral organizations, but also involving the European Union, UNMIK and ICO.  In addition, other USG agencies such as US Treasury and US Department of Justice have advisors working side-by-side with USAID-funded advisors.  Thus, the working environment requires constant attention to communication and coordination with all stakeholders.

BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION

The Senior Policy Advisor will be based in the Economic Growth Office (EGO) and report directly to the EGO Director.  Travel within and outside of Kosovo will be required. 

The Senior Policy Advisors primary task will be overall responsibility and management of EGs portfolio of activities that are assisting in the establishment of Kosovo economic institutions, policies and legal framework as well as privatization.  Currently, this means oversight of the EMSG project, but could include other, smaller, activities as well.  EMSG is a high-profile, dynamic and flexible project.  EMSG includes work in: macro-economic analysis; fiscal management; tax administration; public-private partnerships; commercial law; privatization; and Central Bank supervision. The Senior Policy Advisor must have a solid grasp on the objectives of EMSG in order to ensure that it achieves its maximum potential for success.  The Senior Policy Advisor will be required to maintain EMSGs momentum, vision and priorities.

In addition, the Senior Policy Advisor will advise the EG Office Director as well as other senior USAID management on important policy issues involving Kosovos economic growth.  The Senior Policy Advisor will also participate in strategy and planning discussions and meetings involving present and future EG work and will also assist in other EG office activities that may arise.

As an overarching requirement, the Senior Policy Advisor must understand and be able to analyze all of the complex and interdependent factors that affect Kosovos economic growth in order to assist the mission in making informed decisions about activities.  As with any country, this is a complicated endeavor; however, certain aspects of Kosovos political and economic situation make this task somewhat unique.

The Senior Policy Advisor will be expected to perform with a high-level of independence, to exercise good judgment and make independent decisions that can be defended as necessary.  He/she will be expected to propose solutions to any problems that may arise and to take prompt actions necessary to resolve issues and problems.  

MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Senior Policy Advisor will perform the following major duties and responsibilities:

1. Overall management oversight of EMSG 

EMSG  has four stated objectives: Strong economic institutions for sound fiscal and financial sectors, Trade and investment stimulated through a modern and well-implemented legal framework, Publicly Owned Enterprises (POEs) privatized or commercialized.  Although EMSG also consists of a fourth component aimed at energy sector reform and this section is being managed by a different USAID Energy Advisor, the Senior Policy Advisor is expected to provide input in this area as necessary.  Thus, it serves several interrelated sectors, linking fiscal, financial and legal reforms with other key areas such as trade, and privatization   each area a prerequisite for sustained economic growth.  

EMSG is the sixth in a series of task orders.  The first task order, which began in 1999, provided assistance in creating the institutions, policies and legal framework that are the pre-conditions for economic growth.  Initial assistance focused on the following:  (1) establishing a Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE) and fiscal policy; (2) establishing the supervision department of the Central Bank of Kosovo (CBK); (3) drafting tax laws and establishing the Tax Administration of Kosovo (TAK); (4) designing and implementing a modern pension system;  (5) drafting modern commercial laws; (6) designing and implementing a privatization scheme for Socially-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).  

These task orders have, to a large extent, continued this work, although each task order has also been tailored to address specific needs.  In addition, these task orders have had sufficient flexibility to meet new needs and requests.  For example, in 2006, at the request of the first Minister of Energy, USAID became involved in energy policy assistance.  

Under Objective 1, EMSG continues work in MFE, TAK and CBK, institutions for which USAID has been a primary donor.  While these institutions all enjoy a large amount of success, they have yet to fully develop their capacities and gain the experience and maturity needed to ensure their sustainability.  Importantly, because of Kosovos new status as an independent nation, a donors conference was held in June 2008.  Because of EMSG presence in MFE, it was positioned to assist the ministry in its readiness for this high-profile and extremely important event.  One main need will be ensuring that the Medium Term Expenditure Framework  which served the basis at the donors conference - continues to be of high quality.   

Objective 2 aims to ensure that Kosovos new commercial laws are understood and used by all, including the business community, the attorneys and the judges.  Core commercial laws have been enacted in Kosovo, but are largely not implemented.  This lack of understanding and implementation is an impediment to investment, both foreign and domestic.  Thus, EMSG is providing training on commercial laws through the Kosovo Judicial Institute, the Chamber of Advocates and the Chamber of Commerce.

Objective 3 anticipates privatizing the few remaining big-ticket SOEs, and also includes assistance on strategies for commercializing, concessioning, or divesting the Publicly-Owned Enterprises (POEs).  In particular, under the third objective, the task order will work to concession the Pristina International Airport and to make progress in privatizing the electric utility company, KEK.  

A cross-cutting and overarching need of EMSG is for improved government processes, information sharing, and implementation of good governance principles.  Transparency and openness of government will become increasingly important in order to maintain public confidence in governing institutions.

The overarching goal of EMSG is an environment conducive to economic growth.  As noted above, the private sector can thrive only in a stable macroeconomic environment with a robust trading regime and modern commercial laws that are enforced.  Equally important, the private sector requires resources for services and production such as a reliable energy supply and adequate infrastructure.   Economic growth for Kosovo depends on progress in all areas.  Successes in these combined areas will have a substantial impact on Kosovos economic growth. 

The Senior Policy Advisor will directly supervise two local staff FSNs.  These two FSNs act as Activity Managers for different components of this project.  The Senior Policy Advisors role will be to oversee the entire project to ensure that EMSG successfully achieves each objective, stays on track, and that competing project needs are met in a way that maximizes and prioritizes use of project resources.  

The Senior Policy Advisor will ensure quality day-to-day management of EMSG, including determination of work priorities, making decisions on activity implementation matters, identifying and resolving EMSG program issues, ensuring that all activities are carried out in a technically sound and cost-effective manner, assigning responsibility for program management and implementation matters to subordinates, and ensuring that activities are carried out in accordance with all applicable mission and USAID directives and requirements.  

2.  Provide strategic policy advice and management assistance

The Senior Policy Advisor will provide analysis, advice and recommendations to senior Mission management, U.S. Embassy and staff regarding the formulation of mission strategies relevant to economic growth and to activities in the EG portfolio.  The Senior Policy Advisor will participate, as required, in the development of mission strategic plans, portfolio reviews, performance monitoring plans, budgets and reporting documentation.  In addition the Senior Policy Advisor will determine what additional analyses, assessments or reviews are required for the development of mission strategies or activities in the area of economic growth development and will design and oversee the implementation of such analyses or assessments.

The Senior Policy Advisor will continuously stay abreast of Kosovos economic situation and developments affecting its economy and affecting EG activities.

The Senior Policy Advisor will work in line with USAID regulations and procedures to rapidly shift resources in response to changed circumstances, needs and requirements.

The Senior Policy Advisor may also be called upon, occasionally, to manage other activities in the EG portfolio either as an activity manager or as Cognizant Technical Officer.

The Senior Policy Advisor will be expected to perform with a high-level of independence, to exercise good judgment and make independent decisions that can be defended as necessary.  He/she will be expected to propose solutions to any problems that may arise and to take prompt actions necessary to resolve issues and problems.  

The Senior Policy Advisor will report frequently to senior mission officials and will be a principal liaison with US Embassy and international organizations on issues involving economic growth and EMSG.  He/she will advise on economic growth issues and related USAID activities.

3. Coordinate USAID activities with the Kosovo government and other organizations

The Senior Policy Advisor will meet regularly with senior Government of Kosovo officials, including ministers and heads of agencies.  This may include briefings for the Prime Minister and/or his advisors.  Thus, the Senior Policy Advisor must be stay abreast of all developments pertaining to EMSG and related areas.  He/she must be able to engage in constructive and informed dialog at the most senior levels of government. 

Because of the large and diverse array of international organizations present in Kosovo, the work environment is complicated and requires constant attention.   The complexity and challenging nature of Kosovos working environment cannot be overstated.  The Senior Policy Advisor must establish and maintain close relationships and communication with many organizations to ensure that activities are coordinated.  Again, much of this interaction will be with the most senior officials.  Thus, this communication will require a high level of expertise, including the ability to engage in policy dialogue and be knowledgeable about a variety subjects.

The Senior Policy Advisor will coordinate EMSG activities, and other EG activities as needed, with the Government of Kosovo and with other USG, international and donor agencies working in Kosovo.  This will include, in particular, US Embassy, the US Treasury advisors, the ICO, UNMIK, EU, IMF, WB, DFID, and others.  This will also, occasionally, involve meetings with and reporting to officials from Washington DC, such as officials from Department of State, US Treasury Department and other departments.

<DESC>The Program Support Center on behalf of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF)intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis for a one base year plus two option years with the National Association of Councils on Developmental Disabilities (NACDD) to continue training and technical assistance to the 55 State Councils on Developmental Disabilities (ADD). 

The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD), located within the Administration for Children and Families, Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) is the Federal agency responsible for implementation and administration of the  Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights(DD) Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-402). 

The goal of this contract is to provide technical assistance to the 55 State Councils on Developmental Disabilities whose mission is to engage in advocacy, capacity building and systemic change activities that are consistent with the purpose of the DD Act and; contribute to a coordinated, consumer and family-centered, consumer and family-directed, comprehensive system of community services, individualized supports and other forms of assistance that enable individuals with developmental disabilities to exercise self-determination, be independent, be productive and be integrated and included in all facets of community life.

The goal of this assistance is to improve program performance (increase self-advocacy and build community capacity), statutory compliance and program outcomes across the State Council network.  This contract will enable technical assistance to the State Councils that protect the interests of individuals with cognitive, mental and physical disabilities.  This technical assistance covers a wide array of training, consultation, information dissemination, best practices and capacity building, and advocacy-based training. 

NACDD was established in 2002 to bring together the two organizations that previously supported DD Councils - Consortium of Developmental Disabilities Councils, and National Association of Developmental Disabilities Councils. As such, NACDD represents the diverse interests of its Council members and is the national voice of the State Councils on Developmental Disabilities. Its purpose is to support Councils whose mandate is to implement the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, and to promote the interests and rights of people with developmental disabilities and their families. NACDD works collaboratively with other organizations to advocate for issues across the life span pertaining to individuals with disabilities and their families.

NACDD is a member driven organization and members are encouraged to become involved in building the organization through participation on the Board of Directors or the various work teams (Finance, Public Policy, Council Services, Bylaws, Nominations, Conference, Strategic Planning and Audit).  As the single membership organization for State Councils, NACDD has unique insight into the needs of State Councils and is distinctively positioned to provide technical assistance to the Council network. 
There is no other entity with the innate and exclusive ability to provide the appropriate training and technical assistance to the 55 State Councils across the United States and territories.

Vendors who are interested in this acquisition should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirements.  The statement of capabilities must specifically demonstrate the following:  (1) experience in providing training and technical assistance to State Councils on Developmental Disabilities; (2) experience of organizational structure and the management of State Councils on Developmental Disabilities; (3)  experience in conducting workshops and conferences; (4) experience with State Councils measurement of outcomes and reporting processes; (5) ability to provide staff that has proven successful academic and professional work experiences in the field of developmental, emotional and other significant disabilities; proven ability to direct and mange projects of this magnitude including accounting/bookkeeping; proven experience in providing and coordinating training and technical assistance activities; and proven experience in managing contracts or programs for training and technical assistance as a project director.

Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source to NACDD. Responses must be submitted within 20 days from the date of publication of this notice. No solicitation is available. A determination by the Government not to open to the requirement to competition based upon responses is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This agency intends to award to Clark MacDill Design Build LLC, 4401 Wilson Blvd Suite 600, Arlington VA 22203.&nbsp; The 6th Civil Engineer Squadron requests the installation of a manhole and duct bank system to support the government&rsquo;s Command and Control (C2) communications requirements in the privatized housing area for United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), and the 6th Air Mobility Wing (6 AMW). In particular this system will support C2 communications in 27 General Officer (GO) and 26 Senior (O-6) Officer (SO) houses (a total of 53 houses) which are being built in the privatized housing area by Clark Realty as part of their 50 year housing privatization lease agreement with the government. This lease includes the demolition of 507 existing houses and the construction of 331 new houses. This project will provide a manhole and duct bank system from building P40 to a new communications shelter at the intersection of Phantom Dr and Tampa Point Blvd and continuing the length of Constellation Blvda run of approximately 14,286 linear feet. This duct bank will consist of 4 four-inch ducts, two (2) of which will be multi-cell. The duct banks will either be direct buried or pulled into place with directional boring equipment. This system will bring C2 communications capability to the 53 GO/SO houses cited above. It is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would result in unacceptable delays in in fullfilling the agency&rsquo;s needs. In addition, other alternatives were looked at with other agencies to have this accomplished however because of the proprietary design data and the high duplication of costs, it is in the best interest of the government to have Clark MacDill Builders perform this additional yet interrelated work. Clark owns the proprietary design data for the privatized housing area and is currently 80% complete with the design stage for the government C2 manhole and duct bank system. To avoid substantial cost duplication the government must be ready to execute installing this system alongside the project owner&rsquo;s underground utilities down Constellation Blvd. If the manhole and duct bank system installation does not coincide with the installation of underground utilities, then it will have to be rerouted around Constellation Blvd to avoid incurring delays in the project owner&rsquo;s development plans.&nbsp; The proposed construction period of underground utilities by the project owner is Sep &ndash; Nov 08. This requirement will have a Period of Performance with an estimate of 75 days to complete this project with paving of Constellation Blvd scheduled for the last week of Nov &rsquo;08. This project must commence no later than 1 Sep 08 to keep this project on schedule to meet the BOD. The requirement requires, and will use, FY08 3400 O&amp;M Funding. The 6th Air Mobility Wing (6 AMW) has the responsibility of providing base support to Headquarters, United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in accomplishing its day-to-day mission fighting the Global War on Terrorism. The 6 AMW has successfully provided base support 24-hours a day, seven days a week. To continue to provide the communications support required, the base communications infrastructure must be extended into the privatized housing area. USSOCOM and US CENTCOM has a valued interest in this infrastructure, because it will provide senior leadership with communications connectivity to Defense Information System Network in their residences. This connectivity is necessary to support war fighters in the AOR. USSOCOM supports the requirement to extend the communications infrastructure into the new privatized housing area. Without the communications infrastructure extension, the mission may be jeopardized and risk the lives that depend on our support.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture  Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) anticipates a sole source (name brand) procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for the following requirement:
Cepheid SmartCycler II (Model #SC2000N3-1)

The USDA-APHIS-PPQ WR Plant Pathologist-Domestic Identifier Laboratory located at Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS currently uses the basic SmartCycler platform but needs to double the current real-time PCR cycling capacity.     

The Cepheid SmartCycler platform is the most affordable and expandable of the two real-time PCR diagnostic platforms detailed for use with current USDA-APHIS-PPQ  validated diagnostic protocols used to detect Phytophthora ramorum, Ralstonia solanacearum R3B2, Plum Pox virus, and Citrus Greening (HLB) pathogens; as well as new diagnostic protocols being validated for Potato Cyst Nematode, Potato Wart, Phytophthora kernovii; and insect molecular diagnostic tests currently under development for Light Brown Apple Moth and Pink Bollworm.  

This platform is 100% compatible and expandable with identical platforms/equipment currently housed and operated from the PPQ ER Domestic Identifier Laboratory at Penn State University; the PPQ Molecular Diagnostic and PPQ-CPHST-NPGBL Laboratories co-located at Beltsville, MD; as well as the Great Plains Diagnostic Network hub laboratory at Kansas State University.  At NPGBL, all training on new real-time PCR diagnostic techniques is conducted on this platform exclusively.
Like the basic Smart Cycler platform of a laptop computer and a primary processing block, the add-on Cepheid processing blocks are small, lightweight and portable.  They can be easily deployed into the field or outside-of-laboratory locations with minimal effort.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Ventria BioSciences, 4110 North Freeway, Sacramento, CA 95834, for development of a transgenic plant system for the high level expression of outer-surface protein A (OspA) derived from Borrelia burgdorferi, which will be used to deliver an oral vaccine to small animal reservoirs of the Lyme disease bacterium. Lyme disease has become the most common vector-borne illness in the United States, since its discovery in the mid 1970&rsquo;s. Lyme disease remains a major public health threat due to the increasing range of this disease. It is caused by the spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, which naturally lives in mice, squirrels and other small animals. The blacklegged tick, also known as the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis), is the principal vector of Lyme disease spirochetes. These ticks feed on the blood of small animals as part of their normal life cycle, taking up B. burgdorferi into their bodies, where the bacterium can live within the midgut of the tick. While in the midgut of the tick, it was discovered that the B. burgdorferi spirochete produced outer-surface protein A (OspA), which is proven to be antigenic and induce a protective immune response against tick-transmitted B. burgdorferi when animals are immunized. B. burgdorferi can be transmitted to other animals, including deer, and also humans by the bite and subsequent bloodmeal of an infected tick. Although deer are not susceptible to this bacterium, humans typically are, and the result is the condition known as Lyme disease. Symptoms of Lyme disease include fever, headache, fatigue, and often also a rash called erythema migrans. If detected and treated early enough, the disease is fully curable. If left untreated, the disease can spread to the joints, heart and nervous system. It is estimated that there are thousands of people with Lyme disease in the United States, with the numbers steadily increasing each year, since reporting first began in the early 80&rsquo;s. In 2004, the number of cases reported to the CDC exceeded 20,000. It is also thought that the number of cases in the US is under-reported. In the 1990&rsquo;s, a vaccine to prevent Lyme disease in humans was made available. The vaccine is based on OspA, which makes up approximately one-third of total spirochete protein. When used in a vaccine, OspA was shown to provide a protective immune response for the recipient of the vaccine to protect against tick-transmitted B. burgdorferi infection. The vaccine was pulled from the market in 2002 by the manufacturer presumably after poor sales and controversial adverse events reported by recipients of the vaccine. Currently, the only options for preventing Lyme disease transmission to humans are tick control methods and personal protective measures, such as repellent use and visual inspection for tick attachment. Our program is exploring the use of OspA again, but this time for use as an oral vaccine to protect small animals, such as mice and squirrels, against infection with the spirochete instead of for human use. The goal is to accomplish widespread immunization of wild animal reservoirs of this disease via natural forage material, such as rice grain, to prevent transmission to reduce the incidence of infection of small animal reservoirs and ticks, and therefore greatly impact transmission of B. burgdorferi to humans through the bite and bloodmeal of black-legged ticks. If done correctly, this should effectively reduce the spread of Lyme disease within endemic communities. The vendor will furnish all labor, materials and equipment necessary to develop a highly effective, but relatively inexpensive, large-scale rice grain delivery system for an oral vaccine designed for small animals, such as mice, and based on the outer-surface protein A (OspA). This OspA oral vaccine delivery system will be used to inoculate wild mice, and other small animal vectors of Lyme disease, against the Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete. The vendor will be responsible for producing and analyzing this delivery system for successful transformation of the OspA protein into the rice grain. Individual vaccination of animals is not acceptable or practical to attain community-wide prevention and control. Summary of specific tasks: 1) Synthesize the OspA gene and verify by sequence analysis; 2) Construct a plasmid that will incorporate the synthesized OspA gene and verify by sequence analysis; 3) Transform this plasmid construct into a rice grain delivery system as specified in the above scope of work; 4) Verify successful transformation by PCR analysis; verify lipidation of the OspA protein; 5) Perform expression analysis to determine the recombinant OspA level in the rice grain by ELISA using anti-OspA antibody available from CDC; 6) Deliver at least (2) new OspA constructs in rice that would be available and in sufficient quantity for in vivo testing, i.e. for (10) in vivo trials utilizing 50 mice per trial, and at least 200 &#61549;g/mouse total OspA protein; 6) Report. The vendor will be performing the following tasks: 1) Gene synthesis and plasmid construction for rice transformation. The vendor will produce at least 2) transgene constructs &ndash; recombinant rice endosperm expressing Borrelia burgdorferi outer-surface protein A (OspA) &ndash; using standard molecular cloning techniques. At least (1) construct shall be shown to be lapidated OspA. The vendor shall supply a report on OspA gene synthesis and the plasmid construct. (2) Transformation of plasmids and transgene analysis of transgenic rice plants. The vendor will transform rice by microprojectile bombardment of the transgene construct produced in Task 1. The transformed rice material will be incubated in select media to regenerate rice plants and grow them to maturity. Transgenic rice plants will be screened by PCR analysis to select for only those that are positive for rOspA. 3) Harvest transgenic rice seed for two potential constructs and analyze OspA expression levels. The vendor will harvest the seeds from the OspA-positive rice plants for long-term storage seed stock, analyzing expression of OspA, and for sustaining the next generation of transgenic rice plants. OspA expression will be measured by protein analysis, and quantified via ELISA using anti-OspA antibody provided by CDC. 4) The vendor should be able to deliver to CDC recombinant OspA in sufficient quantity for in vivo testing, i.e. for (10) in vivo trials utilizing 50 mice per trial, and at least 200 &#61549;g/mouse total OspA protein. The reports specified under specific tasks and deliverables should also address any problems encountered and suggestions for resolution. The vendor will provide one (1) copy to the Project Officer. In addition, the vendor shall report significant problems that impact the progress or schedule of work, as these problems are encountered, directly to the Project Officer. CDC will provide anti-OspA antibody for the vendor to use in determining expression levels of recombinant OspA in the rice grain delivery system. The Project Officer will provide consultation to the vendor on any aspect of the research as needed. The performance period will be for one year from date of award. The vendor will be providing the following deliverables to the Project Officer by the times established below: Report on the gene synthesis and plasmid constructs within 3 months of purchase order award; Report on delivery system and transgenic analysis within 6 months of purchase order award; and Report on OspA expression in the transgenic rice grain demonstrating lipidation of at least one construct produced within 9-12 months of purchase order award. Vendor will retain rights to publication of novel scientific findings obtained. Inclusion of CDC investigators as authors will follow generally accepted standards for authorship based on contributions to the research. Minimum vendor qualifications are as follows: Knowledge of OspA as a potential expression system centering on small animal models, such as mice and squirrels; Demonstrated ability to produce an effective, targeted direct delivery system of measurable quantities of recombinant protein to small animals, primarily wild mice, via a food source, such as rice grain, that they will readily consume; Ability to analyze a delivery system to show successful transgenesis of high levels of recombinant protein; Develop an oral vaccine delivery method that is cost effective, scaleable, and have an adequate shelf-life to ensure proper dose delivery over time after storage and in the field; Vendor must follow federal regulations when using a recombinant protein for oral vaccine use on animals, ensuring that it is deemed environmentally safe and consumer-friendly. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M.

17) Transfer ethics records to other Institutes and Centers as appropriate

<DESC><p>The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB has a Sole-Source requirement to purchase items as described in the Description of Supplies. This is a streamlined combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
<p>This notice constitutes the only notice. A written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is issued as a request for quote. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 541890; size standard $6.5 M.</p>
<p>IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. A Firm Fixed Priced Award will be made in accordance with the following Description of Supplies:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES</p>
<p>A. The following items will be provided:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001:<br />Description: Exhibit booth space (8' X 10')<br />Qty: Twenty-one (21)</p>
<p>B. Period of Performance: 15 Sep 2008 through 17 Sep 2008</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The Marriott Wardman Park Hotel and the Omni Sheraton Hotel have been selected to host this year's CSTEA participants. The CSTEA has been scheduled for 10-18 September 2008. Part of the CSTEA plan calls for exhibition displays, a ceremony, and a reception. As participants in the CSTEA program, twenty-one competing CSTEA teams are required to set up exhibition display booths to network and dialogue on their process improvements. The Air Force Association (AFA) has selected the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel to host the AFA National Convention. AFMA planning committee has determined that it is in the Government's better interest to hold the exhibitions, ceremony, and reception portion of the CSTEA program in the same facility where the awards and convention activities are scheduled to take place. The AFA has leased the entire Marriott Wardman Park Hotel for 15-17 September 2008 and has designated areas for exhibitions to be held during the convention at the Hotel. During CSTEA 2008, the AFA is the office of primary responsibility for setting up the AFA National Convention and the sole source for the rental of all areas within the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel. The CSTEA planning committee recommends the AFA National Convention as the source to satisfy the CSTEA requirement. The AFA convention is tailored to the professional requirements of Air Force enlisted, officers, guardsmen, and reservists. Furthermore, it provides AFMA a unique opportunity to promote the CSTEA program in an exclusive environment. The effectiveness, spirit, and moral boost achieved by AFMA's CSTEA Program will deteriorate considerably if AFMA is unable to secure exhibition booths and space as required by the CSTEA program. Market research identified no other vendors providing compatible services within the Marriott/Omni vicinity during the CSTEA scheduled time frame.</p>

To register your company for WAWF, simply log into https://wawf.eb.mil. Step-by-step instructions on how to register and how to submit invoices through WAWF-RA are outlined at https://rmb.ogden.disa.mil.

1752.224-70  Protecting Personally Identifiable Information		   	

	(a) Applicability

	This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act).  The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act.

	(b) Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mothers maiden name, etc. (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf). In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. 

	(c) Responsibilities for Handling PII

	(1) Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. 

(2) All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location.  All contract employees must be:
&#61607; responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.
&#61607; responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.
&#61607; responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.
&#61607; Email cannot be encrypted.  Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  Do not send PII in the content of an email.

	(d) Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	(1) OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network.  Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip.  Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments.  It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agencys network.   

	(2) A password protected file is not secure.  Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.   

	(e) Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII

	(1) A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic.  As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information.  In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. 

	(2) OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk  regardless of the time or day of the week.  Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPMs IT security experts, who will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention.  The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quote, solicitation number SP3100-08-Q-0092

The Defense Distribution Center located in New Cumberland, PA has a requirement to improve the effectiveness of processing all emergency calls associated with DDSP, and to more effectively dispatch appropriate responding services to those emergencies.  In support of this effort, it is necessary for the contractor to install appropriate hardware and software that will provide an integrated application to include interfaces to the existing telephone and Land Mobile Rand System.  The contractor shall be required to provide services, equipment and associated materials in the form of installation setup and end-user training.  

This is a small business set aside for vendors that can provide the brand name equipment (Plant CML Vesta SL-100 system as described below).  The NAICS code is 334210.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334413 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This solicitation shall be set-aside 100 percent for Small Business.

Background:

The general mission of NISTs Engineering Metrology Group is dimensional measurement, and an important part of this is determining refractive index of air when interferometry is the method of measurement.  Refractive index can also be used to infer gas pressure, and NIST is investigating how this relationship can be utilized.  These optical cavities will be the central part of a study of refractive index for these applications.

The critical factor is to develop Fabry-Perot cavities to which gas can be admitted to determine refractive index.  The basic idea is that the cavities must be as stable as possible, so that the only variations in optical pathlength are associated with gas refractive index changes.  



***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001:  Quantity Two (2) Optical Cavities, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:

We require two optical cavities, where each cavity is constructed as described below.   

 The cavity will have two IBS mirrors (with ULE substrate) that are optically contacted to a ULE spacer. NIST will provide the spacer as described below.  The spacer is square in cross-section, approximately 60mm on a side, and there is a slot cut through the spacer that goes a little more than half way through, so as to provide an air path at a point near the neutral axis of the cavity.  The cavity would then look something like the picture in attached document 1.

This requirement is for two (2) cavities: the first as shown in attached document 1, with a spacer 330 mm long, and the second (about half as long) with a 143 mm spacer.  The slot shall be 8 (minimum) to 11 (maximum) mm wide (the exact width at the discretion of the vendor).  The slot shall extend below the center of the spacer so that the cavity mode can be centered at a point near the neutral axis of the spacer; it shall extend below the center of the spacer by an amount somewhere between 4 (minimum) and 6 (maximum) mm (the exact depth at the discretion of the vendor).  The cavity cross-section will be a little smaller than 60 mm x 60 mm, but larger than 50 mm x 50 mm. 
  
Initial rough manufacture of the spacers will be done here at NIST: we will cut the slot, drill a few small holes (not shown in the attached picture), and finish the ends at an appropriate angle relative to the axis of the cavity as discussed below.  The vendor will then polish the ends to required flatness prior to optical contacting of the mirrors.

1. Each of the two cavities requires a set of two mirrors. (two sets of mirrors (4 mirrors total) are required)

(a) The substrate shall be Corning ULE (so as to match the material and thermal properties of the NIST-provided spacer).  The ULE shall be of good optical quality (premium grade) suitable for a mirror substrate without undue scattering or wavefront distortion of the beam.
   
(b) One mirror shall be flat and the second shall have a radius of curvature 0.5 m. 

(c)  Mirror reflectivity shall be 99.5% at 633 nm.  

(d)  The back sides of the mirrors shall be AR coated and wedged:  reflection from the back side should be less than 0.2% and the surface shall be wedged at an angle between 1 and 2 degrees. 

(e)  Mirror coatings shall be ion beam sputtered to prevent sensitivity of the mirror coating to humidity.  


2.  It is necessary that NIST know the phase shift of the mirrors at 633 nm, and this requirement can be met in one of two ways.  First, if the vendor will simply tell us the structure of the stack and manufacturing tolerances, we will have sufficient information to calculate the phase shift.  But if the stack structure is proprietary information that cannot be revealed, the manufacturer must calculate the phase shift, along with its uncertainty due to manufacturing tolerances, and provide NIST with this information.  

3. NIST will provide the partially finished ULE spacer, with the two ends cut perpendicular to the neutral axis within 0.1 degree, and are also parallel to each other within 0.15 degree. (These values are suitable for achieving reasonable alignment of the optical mode with the desired axis, assuming that the mirrors are manufactured and positioned in a suitable manner.)  

It is then the responsibility of the vendor to polish the two ends as needed and contact the mirrors. The contacting method must be capable of achieving a strength comparable to the strength of the bulk material, and for this reason an advanced optical contact method which provides greater strength than a classical optical contact is required.  No actual adhesive layer is permissible, but a chemically activated bond is one possible solution.   

4. For the completed assembled cavity, the center of the optical mode shall be located within 2 mm of the neutral axis of the cavity.  Along the horizontal direction, the neutral axis is halfway between the two sides of the cavity.  Along the vertical direction, the neutral axis is located approximately 1.3 mm below the center of the cavity, where the exact value can vary between about 1.0 mm and 1.6 mm depending on the vendors desired slot geometry and on the final, finished external dimensions of the spacer.  The center of the optical mode should be at least 2 mm away from the edges of the mirror coatings or the sides of the slot.  Within 8 weeks of contract award, NIST will send the ULE spacers to the vendor and will also inform the vendor of the exact location of the neutral axis (as calculated from the final, finished dimensions of the cavity).	

5. The cavity finesse shall exceed 300.  (Note that the specified reflectivity of 99.5% is consistent with a finesse of 600, which would be the ideal result.)

6. Finished cavities shall be delivered to NIST no later than 16 weeks after Contractors receipt of the NIST-provided coarse-finished spacers.

1352.217-102 Government Review, Comment, Acceptance and Approval (JAN 1987):

(a)	Documentation, including drawings and other engineering products and reports, required by the contract to be submitted for review, comment, acceptance or approval will be acted upon by the Government within 20 calendar days after receipt by the Government, unless another period of time is specified.

(b)  Review, comment, acceptance or approval by the Government as required under this contract and applicable specifications shall not relieve the Contractor of its obligation to comply with the specifications and with all other requirements of the contract, nor shall it impose upon the Government any liability it would not have had in the absence of such review, comment and acceptance or approval.

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:

1.	Visual-Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications, most importantly the finesse will be measured to verify that it lies in the range given in the specifications, and the position of the transverse mode relative to the specified cavity axis will be determined to verify that it meets specifications.

2.	Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications.  The tests will be performed as soon as the artifact is ready, as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor.

Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the contractors commercial schedule.

FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001.

Award shall be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement, 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price.  Technical capability and past performance, when combined, shall be approximately of equal importance to price.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">These Zeiss confocal instruments are manufactured by
Carl Zeiss, Inc. They require professional maintenance including scheduled
service visits and periodic part replacement. Continuous service requires a
renewable service contract.<span>&nbsp; </span>Carl Zeiss
is the only reliable firm that is capable of repairing and maintaining these
state-of-the art Zeiss confocal models and especially of the Meta
detector and the NLO (non-linear optics). The internal components and
mechanisms of this instrument are proprietary and Carl Zeiss Inc is the only
known source capable of fulfilling the service contract on these
instruments.&nbsp;First, Zeiss service engineers have the highest qualification
for repairing the Zeiss confocal microscopes. They are specially trained in Germany on the
latest models of the instrument. </span></p>

<p>D. EVALUATION AND FACTORS:</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the Contractor whose system provides the best value to the Government. The Government will evaluate quotes based on the following factors - Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability shall have a greater value than Past Performance. Technical Capability when combined with Past performance shall be approximately equal in importance to price. If all things considered are equal, price shall be the determining factor.</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL CAPABILITY will be to determine if the system offered meets all the specifications. Quote shall include the manufacturer and model of the products being offered. Contractor should provide manufacturer/product sales literature that addresses the specifications. Literature or quotation should clearly document if the product offered meets or exceeds the specifications identified above. Contractor must have strength in this type of manufacturing, specifically including having sold similar units to that proposed in their bid as addressed in Past Performance.</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF FACTOR 1 (Technical Capability):</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Technical Capability and qualifications of the proposed system by reviewing each quote. Evaluation will be made to determine if the system meets or exceeds the requirements specified above. Systems meeting all the evaluated areas will be more favorably rated. Systems that do not meet the technical qualifications will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>Under Technical Capability, higher importance may be given for a system with one or more of the additional considerations. Multiple system quotes shall be accepted and are encouraged. Contractor shall clearly identify alternate systems as appropriate.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - PAST PERFORMANCE will be to determine Contractors history of products, services and experience in successfully providing comparable systems. Contractor shall include no fewer than 3 references, including address, phone number, and point-of-contact, from users who are currently operating the make and model of the proposed system in the field. Referenced models need not be of the current production year, but shall be production equipment manufactured within the past 24 months and designed for the same or similar purpose, and should be as functionally similar to the equipment being proposed. Proprietary information shall be marked as such or may be redacted prior to submission.</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF FACTOR 2 (Past Performance):</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the historical delivery, Performance and Satisfaction of systems in the field to determine the degree of Experience in successfully providing comparable systems for the same or similar types of applications (in scope or complexity). References may be queried to determine if past performance, 1) exceeded expectation, 2) meet expectations, or 3) failed to meet expectation in the areas of quality of equipment, timeliness of delivery, and perceived customer satisfaction. Contractors demonstrating a higher level of successful past performance in the evaluated areas will be more favorably rated. In the case of a Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Contractor will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>Past Performance on contracts with the Federal Government, other public agencies, or private organizations may be considered. The past performance information submitted may be that of the Offeror's firm or its proposed subcontractors. Subcontractor past performance will only be considered if the past performance correlates to the work the contractor will be performing on the contemplated contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor should disclose any instances in which its Past Performance on a particular contract may be considered by others to be less than fully satisfactory by attaching a narrative. The Contractor should relate pertinent facts and circumstances and describe any remedial action taken or to be taken to correct the deficiency. Failure to disclose such instances may result in a determination that the Contractor has been less than candid with the Government, which could result in an unfavorable assessment of the Offeror's past performance record.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to limit the number of references it ultimately contacts and to contact references or use sources other than those provided by the Contractor to obtain information related to past performance. Other sources include, but are not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System; Federal, State or local governmental agencies; and private sector businesses. Limited exchanges between the Government and a Contractor may occur to clarify the relevance of a Contractor's past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the Contractor has not previously had an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price will not be evaluated on proposals that are deemed technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>FACTOR 3 PRICE: Price shall reflect the total price, inclusive. Contractor should ensure that their quote constitutes their best offer in terms of both price and the technical solution being proposed.</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF FACTOR 3 - (Price)</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate PRICE to determine if the&nbsp;proposal is fair and&nbsp;reasonable. Reasonableness will be determined considering other competitive prices received and comparison to the independent Government estimate. If multiple contract line items are included in the price schedule, prices will also be evaluated to determine whether any line items are unbalanced. Contractors are cautioned to distribute costs appropriately.</p>
<p>Contractors holding any Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC) shall provided contract number and contracting agency.</p>
<p>(VII) Place of delivery is Department of Commerce, NIST 818 - Bldg 22, 325 Broadway, Boulder, Colorado 80305-3328. Delivery shall be FOB Destination.</p>
<p>(VIII) Required delivery is based on Contractor lead-time, and Contractor shall state a delivery schedule based on their actual best to worst scenarios of similar equipment.</p>
<p>(IX) FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (JUNE 2008), applies to this acquisition. In addition to written price quotes, Offers are instructed to provide literature and references as identified in the Evaluation Factors.</p>
<p>(X) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999), applies to this acquisition. Paragraph (a) is hereby completed as follows: The following factors in order of importance shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price. See Evaluation and Factors Section D for requirements.</p>
<p>E. EVALUATION PROCESS:</p>
<p>The Government will use a best value trade-off process for this source selection. Award will be made to the responsible Contractor whose offer conforms to the requirements and provides the best value to the Government considering all factors.</p>
<p>A Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP) and a Source Selection Authority (SSA) comprised of Government personnel, with assistance from non-Government advisors when required, will evaluate the proposal.</p>
<p>Quotations will be evaluated against the factors set forth in Section A. The SSA will evaluate price proposals independent of the TEP evaluation. The TEP will not have access to price information until completion of the technical evaluation. The technical evaluation will be conducted in strict confidence. Proposals will be evaluated based on the factors described herein.</p>
<p>Quotations will receive a preliminary review to determine whether the bid contains sufficient information, as required by specified herein.

<p>D. EVALUATION AND FACTORS:</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the Contractor whose system provides the best value to the Government. The Government will evaluate quotes based on the following factors - Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability shall have a greater value than Past Performance. Technical Capability when combined with Past performance shall be approximately equal in importance to price. If all things considered are equal, price shall be the determining factor.</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL CAPABILITY will be to determine if the system offered meets all the specifications. Quote shall include the manufacturer and model of the products being offered. Contractor should provide manufacturer/product sales literature that addresses the specifications. Literature or quotation should clearly document if the product offered meets or exceeds the specifications identified above. Contractor must have strength in this type of manufacturing, specifically including having sold similar units to that proposed in their bid as addressed in Past Performance.</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF FACTOR 1 (Technical Capability):</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Technical Capability and qualifications of the proposed system by reviewing each quote. Evaluation will be made to determine if the system meets or exceeds the requirements specified above. Systems meeting all the evaluated areas will be more favorably rated. Systems that do not meet the technical qualifications will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>Under Technical Capability, higher importance may be given for a system with one or more of the additional considerations. Multiple system quotes shall be accepted and are encouraged. Contractor shall clearly identify alternate systems as appropriate.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - PAST PERFORMANCE will be to determine Contractors history of products, services and experience in successfully providing comparable systems. Contractor shall include no fewer than 3 references, including address, phone number, and point-of-contact, from users who are currently operating the make and model of the proposed system in the field. Referenced models need not be of the current production year, but shall be production equipment manufactured within the past 24 months and designed for the same or similar purpose, and should be as functionally similar to the equipment being proposed. Proprietary information shall be marked as such or may be redacted prior to submission.</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF FACTOR 2 (Past Performance):</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the historical delivery, Performance and Satisfaction of systems in the field to determine the degree of Experience in successfully providing comparable systems for the same or similar types of applications (in scope or complexity). References may be queried to determine if past performance, 1) exceeded expectation, 2) meet expectations, or 3) failed to meet expectation in the areas of quality of equipment, timeliness of delivery, and perceived customer satisfaction. Contractors demonstrating a higher level of successful past performance in the evaluated areas will be more favorably rated. In the case of a Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Contractor will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>Past Performance on contracts with the Federal Government, other public agencies, or private organizations may be considered. The past performance information submitted may be that of the Offeror's firm or its proposed subcontractors. Subcontractor past performance will only be considered if the past performance correlates to the work the contractor will be performing on the contemplated contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor should disclose any instances in which its Past Performance on a particular contract may be considered by others to be less than fully satisfactory by attaching a narrative. The Contractor should relate pertinent facts and circumstances and describe any remedial action taken or to be taken to correct the deficiency. Failure to disclose such instances may result in a determination that the Contractor has been less than candid with the Government, which could result in an unfavorable assessment of the Offeror's past performance record.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to limit the number of references it ultimately contacts and to contact references or use sources other than those provided by the Contractor to obtain information related to past performance. Other sources include, but are not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System; Federal, State or local governmental agencies; and private sector businesses. Limited exchanges between the Government and a Contractor may occur to clarify the relevance of a Contractor's past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the Contractor has not previously had an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price will not be evaluated on proposals that are deemed technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>FACTOR 3 PRICE: Price shall reflect the total price, inclusive. Contractor should ensure that their quote constitutes their best offer in terms of both price and the technical solution being proposed.</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF FACTOR 3 - (Price)</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate PRICE to determine if the proposal is fair and reasonable. Reasonableness will be determined considering other competitive prices received and comparison to the independent Government estimate. If multiple contract line items are included in the price schedule, prices will also be evaluated to determine whether any line items are unbalanced. Contractors are cautioned to distribute costs appropriately.</p>
<p>Contractors holding any Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC) shall provided contract number and contracting agency.</p>
<p>(VII) Place of delivery is Department of Commerce, NIST 818 - Bldg 22, 325 Broadway, Boulder, Colorado 80305-3328. Delivery shall be FOB Destination.</p>
<p>(VIII) Required delivery is based on Contractor lead-time, and Contractor shall state a delivery schedule based on their actual best to worst scenarios of similar equipment.</p>

<p>A Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP) and a1 Source Selection Authority (SSA) comprised of Government personnel, with assistance from non-Government advisors when required, will evaluate the proposal.</p>
<p>Quotations will be evaluated against the factors set forth in Section A. The SSA will evaluate price proposals independent of the TEP evaluation. The TEP will not have access to price information until completion of the technical evaluation. The technical evaluation will be conducted in strict confidence. Proposals will be evaluated based on the factors described herein.</p>
<p>Quotations will receive a preliminary review to determine whether the bid contains sufficient information, as required by specified herein. If the results of this preliminary review indicate that the bid lacks sufficient information to allow a meaningful evaluation to be conducted, the Government may eliminate the proposal from further evaluation and consideration for an award.</p>
<p>After completion of the technical and price evaluations, the TEP will report the results to the SSA. The SSA will then consider all technical and price factors, including assessing the degree of risk associated with the bid, to determine the offer that provides the overall best value to the Government. The SSA's decision will be based on a comparative assessment of bid against all source selection factors specified herein.</p>
<p>The Government may elect to accept other than the lowest priced proposal when the perceived benefits of a higher priced bid merit the additional cost.</p>

10.  SCOPE OF WORK:

INTRODUCTION:

The USAID Mission for Serbia and Montenegro (USAID/SM) promotes political and economic development in Serbia and a newly independent Montenegro.  A sovereign nation since 2006, Montenegro is working to ensure a stable democratic transition and to secure long-term stability and economic prosperity.  The U.S. supports Montenegro in its efforts to consolidate democratic and economic reforms as well as its rapid integration into the wider Euro-Atlantic community.  To address these efforts, USG assistance to Montenegro includes activities to improve governance and implementation of economic reforms.  Activities in these two areas focus to improve democracy structures, civil society, and private sector conditions in economically vulnerable areas such as in the North.

USAID/SM requires contracted services of a development assistance professional with strong leadership and management skills to guide the USAID assistance program in Montenegro.  S/he will lead the start-up of a major sustainable tourism initiative and will manage the successful phase-out of other elements of the assistance program with a goal of USAID phase-out in Montenegro by 2012.  The contract for the Montenegro OIC position will be for a period of two years. The position will be based in Podgorica, Montenegro and will require periodic travel to Belgrade, Serbia for administrative support and coordination with USAID/SM Mission management.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

The contractor is required to possess an extremely high degree of competence, professional maturity, and well rounded experience in performing a variety of program and project management functions.  USAID assistance to Montenegro is managed by USAID/SM, via its satellite country office in Embassy/Podgorica.  This program requires a strong self-directed manager.  The programming and implementation of USAID programs and ultimate phase-out from Montenegro is complex.

Working under the direct supervision of the Deputy Mission Director of USAID/SM (or designee), the contractor will participate in and provide substantive input to project implementation, monitoring, and reporting.  S/He will also provide active program coordination with counterparts and implementing agencies; NGOs, including those receiving USAID funds and others; international organizations; representatives of the international donor community; and USAID/Washington cognizant staff.  S/He will also work closely with and at the direction of the USAID/SMs Front Office, to ensure that phase-out programming and implementation remain consistent with USAIDs strategy for Montenegro.

The Officer-in-Charge (OIC) for Montenegro is the senior USAID official and the chief spokesperson for the USAID/SM Mission Director on matters related to USAIDs initiatives in Montenegro.  Montenegros USAID office is co-located with State and other USG agencies in the newly established U.S. Embassy in the capital city of Podgorica.

With an eye to the expected close of USAID operations in Montenegro in 2012, the OIC will also be primarily responsible for the smooth phase-out of USAID assistance to Montenegro.  This will include design and implementation of legacy activities as appropriate and in conformity with USAID policies, procedures. 

B.  Representing the USAID/SM Mission Director as required, and briefing Montenegrin host country government officials, bilateral and multinational donors, private individuals and others as needs of USG development assistance programs, policies, objectives and development priorities dictate, thus ensuring coordination and achievement of maximum development impact with USAID resources.

Providing analyses and advice on the evolving political and economic conditions in Montenegro that is relevant to the development and implementation of USAIDs programs.  This includes reporting routinely  in writing and verbally  to USAID/SM and senior officers of the Europe & Eurasia (E&E) Bureau in Washington on these political and economic developments.

ATTACHMENT 1				
USAID/General Notice
POLICY-REMINDER
SEC 05/16/2002


Subject: Dual Citizenship Policy

1.  The purpose of this notice is to explain existing national and USAID policy for all employees and to inform potential applicants for Civil Service, Foreign Service and USAID contract positions of the possible effects of dual citizenship on security clearance determinations. Dual citizenship can present a security issue in whether to permit access to classified information, thereby affecting recruitment, employment and assignments.  The general information herein may also be found in State 54446, dated March 21, 2002 which outlines Department of State and Diplomatic Security policy as it concerns dual citizenship in personnel security matters.
 
2.  USAID security clearance evaluations and determinations are the responsibility of the USAID Office of Security (SEC).  SEC is required to consider dual citizenship in conducting personnel security investigations and making security clearance evaluations/determinations in accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 10450, E.O. 12968, and the March 24, 1997 Adjudicative Guidelines.

3.  Security clearance evaluations/determinations must ensure that access to classified information for a specific individual is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security." Under the adjudicative guidelines, "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  When making such a determination, SEC must consider all available information, both positive and negative.  This is the "whole person" concept. Dual nationality is a relevant element in some cases. While U.S. citizenship is a basic eligibility requirement to be considered for access to classified information, it does not automatically confer the right to a security clearance.  Dual citizenship must be considered in context of other circumstances in an individual's 
background.

4.  USAID has not implemented, and does not intend to implement, a "blanket rule" regarding dual citizenship.  In making security clearance determinations, SEC will continue to evaluate dual citizenship issues on a case-by-case basis.  Applicants will be required to complete a Dual Citizenship Questionnaire as part of their application and may answer questions about these issues during a subject interview.  Current employees will not generally be questioned about any foreign citizenship until the regularly 
scheduled periodic reinvestigation when they will also be required to complete a Dual Citizenship Questionnaire.  Should an event trigger a review of an employee's access eligibility before their routine update, any foreign citizenship will be addressed at that time. 

5.  Facts about any subject's conduct and behavior developed through required background investigation are weighed against criteria in the adjudicative guidelines. SEC must be able to determine that granting access to classified information is clearly in the national security interest. A fundamental adjudicative 
principle is that the mere absence of derogatory information is not sufficient grounds to grant a security clearance. The government must, through an appropriate investigation and evaluation, establish a personal and professional history that positively affirms the individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness and 
loyalty to the United States. If there is any doubt about unquestioned preference for and allegiance to the United States, unencumbered by any undue foreign influence, SEC must render a determination in favor of the national security and determine the individual ineligible for access. These same adjudicative 
principles are used in all federal personnel security programs.

6.  The evaluation element presented by dual citizenship is that it could raise an issue of possible divided loyalty to the United States.  Title 32 C.F.R. 174.5, Adjudicative Guideline C, Foreign Preference, provides:

	(a)  The concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United 	States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.

	(b)  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:

	(1)  The exercise of dual citizenship;
	(2)  Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;
	(3)  Military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country
	(4)  Accepting educational, medical or other benefits, such as retirement and social welfare, from a foreign country;
	(5)  Residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements;
	(6)  Using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another country;
	(7)  Seeking or holding political office in the foreign country;
	(8)  Voting in foreign elections;
	(9)  Performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as to serve the interests of another government in preference to the interests of the United States.

	(c)  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: 

	(1)  Dual-citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country;
	(2)  Indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) Occurred before obtaining United States 	citizenship; 
	(3)  Activity is sanctioned by the United States;
	(4)  Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.

7.  To illustrate the SEC evaluation process regarding dual citizenship, some examples that have arisen recently are provided below. SEC's goal is to maintain consistency in its determinations. There may appear to be many similarities between cases, however, individual circumstances vary greatly and may not be known to the hiring entity. While not all inclusive, the following examples give an indication of how such factors are evaluated and determinations made:

Example A:  A subject derived foreign citizenship from his or her parents. In this case, SEC would examine whether or not the subject has exercised the foreign citizenship: by accepting educational, 
medical or social welfare benefits for himself/herself or family; possessing and using the foreign passport; serving in the foreign military; working for the foreign government; etc.  In the absence of the subject's exercising foreign citizenship, and if subject's current and past actions consistently demonstrated preference for and allegiance to the United States, then dual citizenship would not preclude a security 
clearance.

Example B:  A subject only recently became a naturalized U.S. citizen through marriage and has no previous ties to the United States.  In this case, SEC could not likely grant an immediate security clearance, since the demonstrated loyalty requirement could not be satisfied immediately.  Eligibility for access could be reconsidered after a passage of time during which the subject would have the opportunity to clearly demonstrate preference for and unquestioned allegiance to the United States, and in the absence of any undue conflicting influence, as required by the referenced guidelines.

Example C:  A subject was born in the U.S. as the child of foreign visitors. The subject left the U.S. in infancy, never returned and has no ties or history which indicates a preference for and allegiance to the United States.  SEC would not have the background information required to grant a security clearance.

Example D:  A subject is a naturalized U.S. citizen and dual national who is willing to relinquish his foreign passport but is not/not willing to renounce foreign citizenship of birth. The subject explains that the reason for this position is: (1) So that children can continue to enjoy free foreign education benefits; (2) For possible future employment opportunities; and (3) For foreign inheritance purposes:  SEC would not be able to clearly determine the individual's preference for the United States, sufficient to grant a security clearance.  

8. SEC will continue adjudicating security clearances pursuant to the "whole person" concept.  The fact that a person holds citizenship with another country, as well as citizenship with the United States, does not automatically result in a security clearance denial.  Conversely, the simple renunciation of foreign 
citizenship would not necessarily result in granting a clearance. An individual must demonstrate unquestioned allegiance to the United States, preference for the United States over any other country and also be free from any undue foreign influence.  If this cannot be established, a security clearance cannot be granted.  Where a newly naturalized citizen is seeking USAID employment, SEC may be unable to adequately investigate the person's background in the country of origin or elsewhere to make this determination. When SEC is unable to clear a new entrant, SEC will so inform HR, and HR will take steps to withdraw the offer.

9.  Should SEC make an unfavorable determination on a security clearance, E.O. 12968 guarantees appeal rights to applicants and employees alike. In cases of appeal, the Agency's final clearance determination is rendered by a panel consisting of the Director of Security (D/SEC), the Deputy Assistant Administrator for Human Resources (DAA/M/HR) and the Assistant General Counsel for Ethics and Administration (GC/EA).  Information on the Agency's appeal process can be found in ADS 566.3.12.2.

10.  Dual citizenship also presents an issue in the assignment of staff to overseas posts. For example, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations does not provide diplomatic privileges and immunities for dual nationals; most countries do not unilaterally grant such privileges and immunities. ADS 566.3.12.1 also describes the potential for exclusion from assignments due to conflicts of interest related to an individual's foreign connections.

11.  Human Resources and appropriate Mission staff should ensure that these policies are made known to potential applicants at the earliest possible stage of the recruitment process.

<DESC><p><strong>SHRP 2 Request for Proposals</strong>
<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal <br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R15 B<br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Identification of Utility Conflicts and Solutions<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> July 29, 2008</p>
<p><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); congestion reduction through improved travel time reliability (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years.</p>
<p><strong>Renewal Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to develop a consistent, systematic approach to completing highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and producing facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing and managing projects, and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal. The renewal scope applies to all classes of roads.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>Potential for conflict with utilities exists in the design of most transportation projects. It is well-recognized that when utility relocation is involved, construction generally takes longer and costs more. Locating and protecting or relocating underground utilities are major causes of delay on highway renewal projects.</p>
<p>The state department of transportation (DOT) design development process is focused on solving a transportation need. In most cases, the transportation design proceeds with limited input from the utilities until the design development process is at the 25 to 30 percent stage. DOTs and utilities report the lack of sufficient communication, scheduling, and coordination in the planning, ROW acquisition, design, and construction phases of road construction projects, which in turn inhibit the timely relocation of utilities.</p>
<p>Designing to limit the impact of utility relocations is the exception rather than the rule. Identifying and resolving potential utility conflicts early in the design process can minimize the total cost and decrease the time to completion of transportation projects.</p>
<p>Some state DOTs have developed forms and tables that identify potential conflicts. For example, the Georgia DOT applies a Utility Impact Matrix to every project involving utilities. Every utility conflict is listed along with a recommendation for resolution, which may include relocating the utility or adjusting the highway design. This matrix is a management tool for identifying potential conflicts and analyzing the best solution for each problem. Utility relocation costs may be reduced by allowing the designer and the utilities to make informed decisions around potential conflicts.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this project is to provide a tool and methodology for identifying and resolving utility conflicts that public agency and utility professionals can use to improve the project development process.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong><br /><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objective. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meet the research objective(s):</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Phase I</em></strong></p>
<p>Task 1: Review and analyze the Utility Conflict Matrices (UCMs) and processes used by state DOTs. At a minimum the review shall include California, Florida, and Georgia.</p>
<p>Task 2: Work with the public agencies identified in Task 1 and identify the following information to help determine best practices and recommendations for developing a UCM for broader use:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What information is included in each state's UCM?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the required components of the UCM?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When is the UCM initiated in each state?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who initiates the UCM? (e.g. project engineer, utility coordinator, designer, project manager, etc)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How often and at what stages is the UCM updated (e.g. new information added and decisions made) and by whom? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is involved in the decision-making process?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does the UCM process help the DOT avoid utility relocations?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under what specific conditions are the UCM components expanded to address project-specific utility complexity?<br /><br />Task 3: Develop a draft UCM and recommended process for its use. The draft UCM shall include the identification of the required and expanded components and specify conditions when each expanded component is to be used.</p>
<p>Task 4: Develop and submit a Phase I Interim report detailing all of the work conducted in the preceding tasks, including the draft UCM, and provide a work plan for Phase II. The Phase II work plan should identify all elements needed to achieve the project objectives and describe how all of the tasks in Phase II will be accomplished. The plan shall include a draft of workshop materials (agenda, handouts, group exercises, etc.) and the recommended public agencies that will participate in Phase II. (See Note1)</p>
<p><em>The Phase I report for this project will be reviewed by the SHRP 2 Technical Coordinating Committee for Highway Renewal to consider the proposed work plan for Phase II, and to determine whether this contract should continue into Phase II.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Phase II</em></strong><br /><em>After approval of the work plan developed in Phase I and on receipt of notice to proceed to Phase II, conduct the following tasks:</em></p>
<p>Task 5: Work with a minimum of two state DOTs that already have UCM processes in place and conduct work sessions to verify usability of the draft UCM and the process for its use. The work sessions should determine gaps and opportunities for improvement of the draft UCM. Attendees of these work sessions shall include a cross section of DOT functional staff having varying levels of project development and utility coordination experience. Attendees at these work sessions should also include utility representatives, design consultants, and FHWA. Additionally, staff from other DOTs and transportation agencies should be notified of the work sessions and encouraged to attend where practicable.</p>
<p>Task 6: Revise the UCM and the recommended process for its use based on the outcome of the previous task.</p>
<p>Task 7: Develop training materials including a procedural manual and other training aids for use in a pilot training program intended for least one state DOT that does not currently have a UCM process in place.</p>
<p>Task 8: Develop and submit a Phase II Interim report detailing all of the work conducted in Phase II and provide a work plan for Phase III. The Phase III work plan should identify all elements needed to achieve the project objectives and describe how all of the tasks in Phase III will be accomplished and include the proposed public agency or agencies that will participate in Phase III.</p>
<p><em>The Phase II report for this project will be reviewed by the SHRP 2 Technical Coordinating Committee for Highway Renewal to consider the proposed work plan for Phase III, and to determine whether this contract should continue into Phase III.</em></p>
<p><strong>Phase III</strong> <br /><em>After approval of the work plan developed in Phase II and on receipt of notice to proceed to Phase III, conduct the following tasks:</em></p>
<p>Task 9: Conduct training with a minimum of 1 state DOT that does not currently have a UCM process to verify the usability of the UCM process and training materials.</p>
<p>Task 10: Revise the UCM training materials and procedural manuals based on the outcome of Task 9. Develop guidelines for implementing the UCM training.</p>
<p>Task 11: Prepare and submit for SHRP 2 approval a draft final report documenting the work conducted in the previous tasks. The draft final report shall include UCM, training materials, and the procedural manual as separate, stand-alone documents.</p>
<p>Task 12: Prepare and submit a final report that responds to SHRP 2 comments on the draft final report. The final report shall include UCM, training materials, and the procedural manual as separate, stand-alone documents.</p>

<p><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Request for Proposals</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal <br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R15 A<br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Model Curricula and Training Programs for Utility Relocation <br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> July 29, 2008</p>
<p><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); congestion reduction through improved travel time reliability (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years. <br /><br /><strong>Renewal Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to develop a consistent, systematic approach to completing highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and producing facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing and managing projects and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal. The renewal scope applies to all classes of roads.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) construct, maintain, and operate highways for the benefit of the public and that has been their traditional charge and focus. Since the advent of the Interstate highway system, states have extended the use of highway right of way (ROW) or expanded existing ROW incorporating the ROW of utilities.</p>
<p>The challenges encountered in coordinating DOT and utility activities are significant for both parties. It is well-recognized that when utility relocation is involved, construction generally takes longer and costs more. Locating and protecting or relocating underground utilities are major causes of delay on highway renewal projects.</p>
<p>The technical complexity of utility systems has increased over time. DOT design engineers and DOT construction contractors have little or no formal training in the technical aspect of utility systems. Utility professionals responsible for coordinating utility relocation work on transportation projects have little or no formal training on the DOT design process. The absence of technical knowledge is an obstacle to coordination. The responsibility for coordinating technical and management aspects of utility relocations is generally assigned to a "Utility Relocation Coordinator." In current practice DOTs, contractors, and utilities all may employ a utility relocation coordinator. However, there is no current standard for the training and experience that qualify this key person. To improve the efficiency of highway renewal efforts, model curricula and certification programs are needed to establish such standards for personnel responsible for utility relocation.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this project are to develop a training program and model curricula to equip agency, consultant, and utility professionals responsible for coordinating and/or designing utility relocation work on transportation projects with a better understanding of the technical challenges faced by all involved parties. It is expected that the model training curricula and training materials would, at a minimum include the following modules:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legal - familiarity with federal and state laws and regulations, permitting and occupancy rights, etc.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coordination - understanding the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved in utility relocation work on transportation projects.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planning - emphasizing the importance of early identification of utility impacts and development of mutual resolution strategies.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design - understanding the basic principles of highway and utility design work, including how to interpret highway and utility plans, identify utility impacts, and develop mutual resolution strategies.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Construction - understanding how project sequencing and construction methods affect contractor and utilities activities.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utility cost estimating and invoicing - understanding the necessity for and methods of developing accurate cost estimates for utility relocation work on transportation projects; and understanding the eligibility and invoicing requirements for reimbursement.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong><br /><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objective. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meet the research objectives:</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Phase I</em></strong></p>
<p>Task 1: Identify and document core competencies, knowledge, skills, and abilities needed by transportation agency, consultant, and utility professionals responsible for coordinating and/or designing utility relocation work on transportation projects.</p>
<p>Task 2: Considering the core competencies indentified in Task 1, develop model training curricula for agency, consultant, and utility professionals responsible for coordinating and/or designing utility relocation work on transportation projects. The curricula will include a clear designation of learning objectives for each instructional module. As a minimum, the instructional materials will include individual modules for: Legal, Coordination, Planning, Design, Construction, and Utility Cost Estimating and Invoicing.</p>
<p>Task 3: Submit the model training curricula for review and approval by SHRP 2.</p>
<p>Task 4: On approval of the model training curricula, develop for each instructional module training materials that support the curricula developed in Task 2. Multiple teaching methods should be used for each module (e.g. lecture, hands-on exercises, case studies, group activities, etc.). The training materials for each module shall include pre- and post tests to evaluate the knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>Task 5: Develop a methodology for evaluating the curricula and training materials developed in the previous tasks and a plan for conducting a pilot training program that includes all training modules in the curricula.</p>
<p>Task 6: Develop and submit a Phase I interim report detailing all of the work conducted in the preceding tasks and provide a work plan for Phase II. Include in the work plan the identification of all elements needed to achieve the project objectives, a description how all of the tasks in Phase II will be accomplished, and the recommended public agencies that will participate in Phase II.</p>
<p><em>The Phase I report for this project will be reviewed by the SHRP 2 Technical Coordinating Committee for Highway Renewal to consider the proposed work plan for Phase II, and to determine whether this contract should continue into Phase II.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Phase II</em></strong><br /><em>After approval of the work plan developed in Phase I and upon receipt of notice to proceed to Phase II, conduct the following tasks:</em></p>
<p>Task 7: Conduct an individual training session for each module of the pilot training program, including the evaluation of the curricula and training materials, and the presentation of the module. The participants shall include a cross section of DOT staff who have varying levels of project development and utility coordination experience. Participants in these training sessions should also include representatives from utilities, design consultants, public agencies, and FHWA.</p>
<p>Task 8: Refine the model curricula and training materials based on the outcome of Task 7 and develop a detailed strategy for conducting a complete training program that presents all modules to a single audience.</p>
<p>Task 9: Using the strategy developed in Task 8 conduct the complete training program that presents all modules. Refine the model curricula and training materials based on the outcome of this task.</p>
<p>Task 10: Develop minimum qualifications for professionals identified by their organization as Utility Coordinators based on the information obtained from all previous tasks.</p>
<p>Task 11: Develop guidelines for implementing the curricula and training materials that describe how to use the curriculum for a variety of learning settings. These settings may include, but are not limited to, distance learning, workshops, short courses, and university courses. Also, describe how the curricula can be deployed for educational purposes (e.g., federal, state, and local governments and the private sector).</p>

<DESC><p><strong>SHRP 2 Request for Proposals</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R06-A <br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Nondestructive Testing to Identify Concrete Bridge Deck Deterioration<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> July 29, 2008<br /><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); congestion reduction through improved travel time reliability (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years. <br /><br /><strong>Renewal Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>The overall goal of the SHRP 2 Renewal program is to develop a consistent, systematic approach to performing highway renewal that is rapid, causes minimum disruption, and produces long-lasting facilities. The renewal scope applies to all classes of roads.</p>
<p><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>In a TRB millennium paper, Chase and Laman (1999) stated,</p>
<p>"the largest problem identified for the NHS [National Highway System] bridges is bridge decks, which are either in poor structural condition or too narrow. It is estimated that over $1 billion is spent on bridge decks each year. Over 88 percent of all bridge deck area (2.8 billion square feet) is concrete, and about half of those bridge decks have a wearing surface over the concrete...There is a need to develop network-level bridge deck evaluation methods that can provide an accurate assessment of bridge deck condition for decks with wearing surfaces... In addition, cost overruns are very common on bridge deck replacement projects, resulting in a need for improved project-level deck evaluation technologies."</p>
<p>The issues presented in this paper are still considered to be valid.</p>
<p>Highway agencies need to evaluate bridge deck condition in order to optimize the effective timing of preventive maintenance, prioritize bridge deck repair and rehabilitation, determine the scope of the required repairs, and make repair/replace decisions. Timing and repair strategies based on nondestructive testing (NDT) results to classify deck condition provide the potential for significant operational improvements. The problem is that deck deterioration frequently takes place below the surface, and cannot be readily evaluated by visual means. Most older decks now have asphalt concrete (AC) or Portland cement concrete (PCC) overlays, making subsurface deterioration conditions even more difficult to detect. Traditional deck inspection methods, such as chain drag, half-cell potentials, and chloride content are slow, require closures, and are not necessarily effective. Over the past 10 years new higher speed technologies such as ground penetrating radar (GPR), infrared thermography, and scanning impact-echo have been developed and implemented to some extent by highway agencies to meet their needs for bridge deck condition assessment. These technologies, however, have not been widely adapted or accepted. Agencies are not fully aware of the capabilities and limitations of these methods, or how they should best be used. Some have had less than positive experiences, possibly due to unrealistic expectations and improper use.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives </strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this project are:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to identify and characterize rapid NDT technologies for concrete deck deterioration;<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to evaluate the strengths and limitations of applicable NDT technologies from the&nbsp;perspective of speed, accuracy, precision,&nbsp;and ease of use;<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to validate the promising technologies;<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to recommend test procedures and protocols for the most effective application of the bridge deck NDT methods evaluated, and;<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to develop a repository for practitioners.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks </strong></p>
<p><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objectives. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meeting the research objectives</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Phase I</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Conduct an international literature search to identify applicable NDT technologies and techniques for different concrete deck types (i.e. slab, voided slab, and deck/girder with and without AC or PCC overlays) and concrete deterioration including delaminations arising from chloride-induced rebar corrosion, cracking caused by alkali silica reaction (ASR), cracking caused by overloading, etc. The literature search should also include technologies used in other industries (such as aerospace, geophysical, etc.) that have potential application in the detection of various types of concrete bridge deck deterioration.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> From the literature search, categorize and rank the most promising techniques from the perspective of speed, accuracy, precision,&nbsp;and ease of use.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Propose validation test beds (existing and/or to be constructed) for independent evaluation of the NDT techniques for each deck deterioration issue under investigation. (See Special Note 1)</p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Propose for SHRP 2 approval an independent panel of experts to review and prioritize the practicality and applicability (speed, accuracy, precision, and ease of use, etc.) for successful implementation of the promising NDT techniques. A minimum of 5 volunteers is suggested for this independent panel, which should include bridge and inspection experts from transportation agencies and (civil) engineering consulting firms. Upon SHRP 2 approval of panel membership, conduct a working session with the independent panel to prioritize the techniques and establish the practical values of speed, accuracy, precision,&nbsp;etc. needed from the technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Recommend the technologies to be evaluated in subsequent tasks and prepare a work plan for Phase II. The work plan needs to include the strategy for inviting vendors and ensuring wide participation during the validation tests in Phase II.</p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Prepare a Phase I Report documenting Tasks 1 through 5. Wait for SHRP 2 approval before proceeding to Phase II.</p>
<p><strong><em>Phase II</em></strong></p>
<p>After approval of the Phase I Report, and on receipt of direction to proceed, conduct the following tasks:</p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Conduct validation tests to evaluate the recommended technologies for each deterioration condition.</p>
<p><strong>Task 8:</strong> Based on the results from Task 7, document the generic features for all NDT technologies tested.</p>
<p><strong>Task 9:</strong> For each deck deterioration condition, recommend the most appropriate NDT technology, equipment specifications, and inspection procedures and protocols that would yield optimum results (based on the desired accuracy, precision, speed, and ease of use as established in Phase I).</p>
<p><strong>Task 10:</strong> Develop an electronic repository (tool-box) of NDT techniques for identification of bridge deck deterioration that could be incorporated into transportation agencies' inspection manuals and/or management systems. The repository should include documentation for test procedures, protocols, photos, sample data output, equipment features (cost, availability, specifications, etc.), advantages, and limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Task 11:</strong> Prepare and submit a Final Report documenting Tasks 1 through 10. The final report should also include suggestions on equipment modifications and/or future research needed to develop promising technologies that could meet any gaps found on the current technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverables </strong></p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phase I Report at the end of Task 6<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Final Report<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Electronic repository of NDT techniques developed in Task 10<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quarterly progress reports <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three (3) interim meetings with SHRP 2 staff: One (1) in Washington, DC and two (2) at the contractor's facility <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Telephone conference calls, as needed<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One (1) interim meeting with the Renewal Technical Coordinating Committee in Washington DC; Irvine, CA; or Woods Hole, MA.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>SHRP 2 Request for Proposals</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R06-D <br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Nondestructive Testing to Identify Delaminations between HMA Layers <br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> July 29, 2008</p>
<p><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); congestion reduction through improved travel time reliability (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years. <br /><br /><strong>Renewal Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to develop a consistent, systematic approach to completing highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and producing facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing and managing projects, and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal. The renewal scope applies to all classes of roads.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>One of the more serious problems that can occur in hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavements is delaminations between HMA layers. Several instances have been documented where pavements with delamination problems have experienced significant early damage. The presence of undetected delaminations and/or discontinuities in asphalt pavements also provides paths for moisture damage and development of other distresses including stripping, slippage cracks, pavement deformation, and reduction in pavement strength. Delaminations are also key contributors to top-down cracking of HMA pavements. A rapid nondestructive test method is needed to determine the existence, extent, and depth of delaminations and/or discontinuities in asphalt pavements so that the appropriate rehabilitation strategy can be determined.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives </strong></p>
<p>The main objective of this study is to identify and develop nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques that are capable of identifying and determining the extent and depth of delaminations and discontinuities in HMA pavements. To achieve this objective the researchers shall determine key indicators that may be used to identify potential areas of delamination including lack of bond, stripping, and other causes. The NDT techniques developed under this project should provide rapid results with near 100% continuous coverage of the pavement area.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<p><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objectives. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meeting the research objectives</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Phase I</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Conduct an international literature search to identify applicable and promising technologies/techniques for identifying debonding of HMA layers, including technologies used in other industries (such as geophysical, aerospace, etc.) but with potential in the area of pavement evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Based on the findings from Task 1, recommend the most promising NDT techniques from the perspective of speed, accuracy, precision, ease of use, etc. When applicable, provide preliminary plans for the development of new or the modification of existing technique(s) that could be carried out under this project.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Propose for SHRP 2 approval an independent panel of experts to review and evaluate the speed, accuracy, precision, ease of use, etc. for successful implementation of the promising NDT techniques. A minimum of 5 volunteers is suggested for this independent panel, which should include pavement, materials, and inspection experts from transportation agencies. Upon SHRP 2 approval of panel membership, conduct a working session with the independent panel to prioritize the promising NDT techniques and establish the practical performance values of speed, accuracy, precision, etc. needed from the technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Develop a detailed research and development (R&amp;D) plan (including controlled laboratory and/or field testing) for proof-of-concept and validation for the most promising NDT techniques. The plan should include testing criteria, experimental design, procedures, data acquisition needs, etc. The plan should also include the proposal for validation test beds (existing and/or to be constructed) for positive proof of the NDT techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Prepare and submit to SHRP 2 an interim report documenting Tasks 1 through 4. Wait for SHRP 2 approval before proceeding to Phase II.</p>
<p><strong><em>Phase II</em></strong></p>
<p>After approval of the Phase I Report, and on receipt of direction to proceed, conduct the following tasks:</p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Execute the approved R&amp;D plan by conducting the planned research, development, and testing activities.</p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> For the technique(s) that proved successful in Task 6, conduct field validation (i.e., in an uncontrolled environment).</p>
<p><strong>Task 8:</strong> Document the R&amp;D and testing results. Additionally, document the testing protocols for the successful techniques (i.e., those that met the performance criteria established in Task 3).</p>
<p><strong>Task 9:</strong> Prepare and submit for review a draft final report documenting the entire project. The final report should also include recommendations for future research. This report will include a stand-alone technical brief summarizing the NDT technique(s) developed, including test procedures, protocols, photos, sample data output, equipment features (cost, availability, specifications, etc.), advantages, and limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Task 10:</strong> Prepare and submit a Final Report that responds to the review comments.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverables </strong></p>

<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Capacity<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> C09<br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Incorporating Greenhouse Gas Emissions into The Collaborative Decision-Making Process<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> July 29, 2008</p>
<p><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); improved travel time reliability through congestion reduction (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years. Additional information about SHRP 2 can be found on the program's Web site at <br />"<a href="http://www.trb.org/shrp">http://www.trb.org/shrp</a>" <a href="http://www.trb.org/shrp2">www.trb.org/shrp2</a>.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Capacity Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>The objective of the Capacity focus area is to develop a consistent framework for reaching balanced, collaborative decisions on enhancing transportation capacity and to provide the tools for applying the framework. The research will develop a transportation project evaluation process to help stakeholders balance the need to reduce delays caused by conflicting demands with the need to produce transportation solutions that support community, economic, and environmental goals. The research will also develop a structure for a project's many contributors to share data and knowledge. This will require identifying critical points for decision making in various processes, the data and knowledge required for these decisions, and successful methods of sharing information.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Linkage to Other SHRP 2 Projects</strong></p>
<p>One of the fundamental products of the SHRP 2 Capacity research program will be a Collaborative Decision Making Framework (CDMF). The objective of this framework is to develop a systems-based, transparent, well-defined framework for consistently reaching collaborative decisions on transportation capacity enhancements. The framework will address about 50 key decision points (KDPs) in six core transportation decision processes:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Systems planning <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-program studies (e.g., corridor studies)<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programming <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Environmental Review<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Permitting</p>
<p>A key decision point is one at which approvals and signoffs are required before the process can advance. SHRP 2 Project C01 is developing the framework and the results of other SHRP 2 Capacity projects, including this one, will be integrated into the framework, creating a unified product for users.</p>
<p>SHRP 2 Project C02 is developing a performance measurement framework, emphasizing environmental and community measures that inform the collaborative decision-making process. Project C02 will create a web-based library of performance measures that will be linked to the key decision points and will aid in selecting measures appropriate in each. <em>(See Special Note 1)</em></p>
<p><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>In the last few years, scientific consensus has strengthened around the fact that the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere is contributing to changes in the earth's climate. While uncertainty remains over the pace and dimensions of the change, a consensus around the need for action has grown among the public and elected officials. In part, this shift has been accelerated by concern over energy security and rising fuel prices. The new political landscape has led many cities, states, and regions to institute policies aimed at reducing GHG emissions. These policies and emerging initiatives have significant implications for the transportation planning process.</p>
<p>About 28% of the United States' GHG emissions are from transportation sources. Carbon dioxide emissions from personal vehicles and trucks account for 82% of these emissions and have grown by 28% since 1990. Unlike conventional air pollutants, carbon dioxide emissions are directly tied to the amount of fuel consumed and its carbon intensity. Therefore, emissions reductions can be achieved by increasing the use of low-carbon fuels, improving fuel economy, or reducing total vehicle miles-often called the three legged stool. (A fourth leg is congestion reduction, at certain optimal speeds). These same factors are related to our use of imported oil, so actions taken to reduce GHG emissions may actually produce benefits in both policy areas.</p>
<p>The global scale and indirect nature of climate change make it impossible to quantify the damages associated with any individual sources of new emissions, no matter how large. While highway projects might contribute to increased greenhouse gases, the climate impacts of expanding capacity in a particular corridor cannot be effectively determined. Therefore, the traditional approaches such as impact mitigation become more complicated. On the other hand, states implementing greenhouse gas policies have chosen to focus primarily on quantifying emissions impacts and setting emissions-reduction goals. Emerging policies and performance measures have been expressed as reductions in vehicle miles traveled, regional emissions targets, or incentive-based goals.</p>
<p>The climatic risks of additional emissions associated with capacity projects must be balanced against the mobility, safety, and economic needs of a community or region. The difficult questions lie in where and how in the transportation planning process the assessments should occur. Project C09 specifically focuses on the state and local collaborative decision-making framework as the context for this work. It will examine strategies to integrate GHG emissions and energy consumption considerations when transportation policy strategies can address both.</p>
<p>This project will NOT focus on transportation and air quality modeling in areas where such modeling is a mature practice. Where such modeling is done, the outputs of travel demand models are inputs to EPA's MOBILE 6 or MOVES models, which estimate emissions, including carbon dioxide. The MOVES model represents a substantial potential improvement over MOBILE 6, but its data needs strain the ability of travel demand models to produce inputs at sufficiently fine detail. The SHRP 2 Capacity Technical Coordinating Committee recognizes that improvements to travel demand models are needed to better address GHGs and has assigned that charge to SHRP 2 Project C10. It should not be emphasized in this project.</p>
<p><em>An astute observer might conclude that where rigorous transportation demand modeling, air quality analysis, and energy use analysis are being conducted, most of the pieces are already present to calculate the GHG emissions and energy use of transportation alternatives. A first step in such places might be adding calculations to an already sophisticated process. Not that it can't be improved, but isn't this a first step for many? Recommendations along this line are appropriate for Project C09. However, since SHRP 2 Project C10 will be concerned with improving travel demand models and the interface with air quality models, modeling the quantity of GHGs produced in areas with mature modeling capability should not be emphasized in Project C09. The C10 problem statement is in the SHRP 2 Research Plan, located in the Capacity section of the SHRP 2 website at TRB.org or</em> <em><a href="http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/shrp2/CapacityResearchPlan.pdf">http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/shrp2/CapacityResearchPlan.pdf</a> </em></p>
<p>Rural areas or regions where rigorous air quality analysis is not required are a different question. How should the GHG issue be addressed there? It doesn't matter where GHGs are emitted, the global effect is the same. Some states are requiring that the GHG effects of long-range transportation plans be estimated, even if the region is not required to conduct air quality analysis to satisfy the Clean Air Act. This is a very real problem at the moment and is within the scope of this project.</p>
<p>This research will be conducted in an environment of uncertainty. Critical policies are currently in flux: The Environmental Protection Agency has announced a proposed rulemaking process to address the issue; states are adopting policies; local governments are adopting targets and goals; and recent fuel price increases are changing driving behavior, at least in the short term. This project should examine ways to incorporate the GHG emission issue into the collaborative decision-making framework based on the current regulatory environment. If the environment changes during the project, we will have to adapt. If it doesn't, this work will contribute to the policy debate. <br /><br /><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this project are to: (1) Develop a strategy or strategies for addressing greenhouse gas emissions at relevant key decision points in the Collaborative Decision-Making Framework; (2) identify relevant material already produced by the normal planning process and the gaps that exist for GHG analysis, (3) prepare materials and methods to address the gaps and integrate them into the CDMF; (4) prepare a freestanding Practitioner's Handbook.</p>
<p>Accomplishing these objectives will require identifying proactive strategies that can be taken by cities, states, and regions to reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector: Identifying what practitioners need to know about greenhouse gases at each stage of the CDMF; identifying the audiences at those key decision points; and identifying the most critical gaps and needs.</p>
<p><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objective. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meet the research objective(s):</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Summarize background conditions, including but not limited to US demographic trends, VMT forecasts, estimates of new lane miles of highway needed in the next 50 years, state and regional GHG targets, forecasts of future fleet mix, and the status of scientific work embodied in the EPA MOVES model. This information is all available, but it needs to be assembled so that it is at the disposal of this project. Also identify the transportation strategies over which state and local governments have direct control or significant influence that have potential to reduce GHG emissions from surface transportation and reduce surface transportation energy use. Prepare a working paper in the form of a stage-setting introductory chapter to the final report. Point out the differences of opinion where appropriate.</p>
<p><em>Note: The budget for Task 1 should not exceed $20,000. (See suggested resources in Special Note 2)</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Review work to date under SHRP 2 Project C01 on the Collaborative Decision-Making Framework (CDMF). Identify key decision points in the CDMF where analysis of GHGs may be appropriate. Consider the approach and decision-making value of GHG analysis at key decision points. The way GHG emissions are considered early in the planning process or in a long-range plan context may be different from the project or corridor level. Consider how decisions made in early stages of the CDMF can be successfully handed forward. <em>(See Special Note 1)</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Review and summarize the cost-effectiveness of transportation strategies identified in Task 1 with respect to GHG reduction potential. Also consider energy use benefits where applicable. Identify high-impact policies with the best potential for implementation. Given the range of strategies available to states and local governments, where can the biggest impact be obtained for the least cost? <br /><em>Note: Rely on prior work in this area to the greatest extent possible. The intent is to provide guidance as to the relative efficacy of possible transportation approaches available to state and local governments.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 4.</strong> Describe several generic GHG analysis situations and develop guidance on where analytic boundaries (e.g., geographic, temporal, construction, operations) should be drawn based on these situations. Use this to provide guidance on what types of analysis have meaning at different stages of the CDMF. For instance, on a large investment project comparing rail and highway alternatives, it may be appropriate to estimate the relative GHG emissions from construction and materials manufacture as well as the relative operational emission over some geographic area over some time period. Perhaps the result of such analyses can be distilled down to typical net per mile values that can be used for planning purposes. For other types of projects, the relative difference in GHG emissions may not be significant, so a project-level analysis is meaningless. For other types of decisions, it may be most appropriate to examine the implication of a 5-year plan or 20-year plan. This project cannot provide final answers because regulators are looking at similar questions. However, it can add some insight to the larger national debate.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Using appropriate outreach techniques assess the GHG analysis needs associated with key decision points in the CDMF and the tools and methods for conducting such analyses that are available to MPOs and states of different sizes and capability levels. For example, locations that do not conduct air quality analysis now are starting with far less information. What is the short-term strategy here? For the key decision points at which GHG analysis is relevant, identify a menu of options that vary by agency size and capability.</p>
<p>Point analysts to the tools that exist and to their prerequisites and limitations. For the situations deemed most in need, develop methods that can be used in the interim while more formal approaches are devised. Develop systematic, step-by-step methods to use information already produced by the planning or design process, supplemented by other information as needed. Describe the information needed and how to obtain it. As called for by the proposed methods, assemble (or provide links to) supporting information from regularly updated third-party sources that contain information such as emission factors, energy use factors, emissions inventories, fleet distribution forecasts, lifecycle GHG impacts of fuels and materials.</p>
<p><em>Note: Task 5 is a crucial task. Devote adequate resources to it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Develop a straw-man strategy or strategies for addressing GHGs and link it to key decision points in the CDMF. The straw man strategy should include institutional relationships, a range of potential policies, analytical requirements, and analysis tools (including those from Task 5). Prepare a working paper.</p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Select at least four states in which transportation agencies are actively developing transportation sector GHG reduction strategies. Develop a plan to conduct workshops or similar exercises in these states to review and refine the straw man. Prepare a rationale for site selection, parties that should be invited, planned format, discussion guides, and baseline information needed. Involve state DOTs, MPOs, and other appropriate stakeholders, such as local governments, private industry, GHG task forces, and environmental agencies. Prepare a working paper and submit to SHRP 2 for review.</p>
<p><strong>Task 8:</strong> Following approval to proceed, conduct the workshops (or similar exercises) as proposed. Prepare a working paper summarizing key findings from each that will be developed for the CDMF.</p>
<p><em>Special note: In the proposal identify the workshop facilitators and their qualifications. The discussion must be focused on how GHG emissions from various surface transportation actions should be incorporated into the CDMF.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 9:</strong> Using the results of Task 8, develop a GHG strategy for the CDMF. Prepare draft materials to support specific key decision points in the CDMF. Specifically, the materials should include but not be limited to enhanced processes, policies, institutional requirements, and tools and methods being developed or already available. Identify and recommend solutions to known shortcomings. Proposers should suggest formats and approaches that will provide the information needed by different types of users at various stages in the CDMF, i.e., long-range plan, Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) corridor or specialty plans, and environmental review.</p>
<p>The materials should be developed in an electronic format that can be integrated directly into a web-based version of the CDMF. It will be necessary at this point to coordinate with a SHRP 2 integration contractor who will be assembling a unified Capacity product. Budget for coordination meetings. Develop the materials recognizing that users of the CDMF may search across key decision points to see how GHG emissions are dealt with at different points or they may search vertically at a particular point for in-depth guidance.</p>
<p>The material should also be organized as a freestanding practitioners' handbook, still keyed to the key decision points in the CDMF. (Include a hypothetical outline of such a document in the proposal.) Submit the draft electronic materials and practitioners handbook to SHRP 2 for review.</p>
<p><strong>Task 10.</strong> Prepare a draft final report that documents project activities and findings. Do not duplicate the material in the practitioners' handbook. Submit the draft final report to SHRP 2 for review.</p>
<p><strong>Task 11.</strong> Following review, submit final products: electronic materials, practitioners' handbook, and final report.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Requirements of the Research Team</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experience with state and metropolitan transportation planning <br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experience with transportation energy and greenhouse gas analysis, including emission factors and air-quality models.<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Familiarity with the activities of various states and groups of states to address GHG emissions. <br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experience with the role and potential of travel demand models and traffic simulation models<br />to address GHG emissions.<br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experience with group facilitation and workshops.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Special Notes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note 1.</strong> The Collaborative Decision-Making Framework is the product of SHRP 2 Project C01 and also the framework to which many SHRP 2 Capacity results will be attached in a large, web-based product. This product is the result of 25 case studies and six focus groups. While it is not absolutely final yet, it is sufficiently mature to serve as the framework for GHG analysis in Project C09. By the time C09 starts, the CDMF will have been vetted in each of the AASHTO regions and will be complete. More information on the Collaborative Decision-Making Framework and other SHRP 2 projects may be found at <a href="http://trb.org/shrp2/SHRPII_Capacity.asp">http://trb.org/shrp2/SHRPII_Capacity.asp</a></p>
<p><strong>Note 2.</strong> In addition to Project C10, other SHRP 2 projects touch on greenhouse gas issues. Project C03 is charged with considering the economic component of any environmental degradation caused by highway projects. For instance, clearing forest land has economic costs, one of which is elimination of a green house gas sink. Projects C06A and C06B are examining the business case for an ecological approach to environmental protection. Preserving or creating sinks is a new benefit that can be added to the business case. While greenhouse gases are not the primary focus of these projects, the C09 research agency will be asked to coordinate with the research teams for the related projects. This will take the form of a conference call(s) or contractors' meeting.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>SHRP 2 Request for Proposals</strong>
<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R06-C <br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Using Both Infrared and High-Speed Ground Penetrating Radar for Uniformity Measurements on New HMA Layers<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> July 29, 2008</p>
<p><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); congestion reduction through improved travel time reliability (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Renewal Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to develop a consistent, systematic approach to completing highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and producing facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing and managing projects, and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal. The renewal scope applies to all classes of roads.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>For hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavement, in-place density is a critical determining factor for pavement durability. Real-time nondestructive testing (NDT) procedures are ideal tools to provide immediate feedback to paving crews so that corrective action can be taken. Promising recent studies have shown that infrared (IR) and ground penetrating radar (GPR) technologies can be used to identify in-place density during construction operations. Both technologies can be used to provide near 100% coverage of constructed layers in contrast to other existing technologies such as nuclear density gauges and electrical impedance devices, which take discrete measurements.</p>
<p>Temperature uniformity is critical for achieving the needed density. Temperature segregation continues to be a frequently reported defect in new HMA overlays, and such segregation is difficult to detect with traditional techniques during mat placement. Thermally segregated areas results in periodic low-density areas in new mats that let water enter lower layers, significantly shortening the performance life of new overlay. IR techniques are already being implemented by some transportation agencies for quality assurance (QA) purposes.</p>
<p>GPR can also be used to measure in real time the density of HMA layers, both during and after compaction. Although this technology is not new, very little progress has been made at implementing them in construction specifications. The Finland Road Authority, for example, has used GPR for HMA density (Saarenketo, 1998) and this was implemented in 2002 as an accepted method of measuring HMA layer density. No department of transportation in the United States has, however, implemented GPR for QA of HMA layers. Field demonstrations are needed to prove that both of these technologies can improve the quality assurance testing of new HMA surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this project is to demonstrate IR and GPR technologies as NDT techniques to assess HMA density and segregation and to make recommendations for how these technologies can be incorporated into existing department of transportation specifications for construction QA. The IR and GPR technologies under investigation should provide near 100% coverage of the constructed surface area.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks </strong></p>
<p><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objectives. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meeting the research objective.</em></p>
<p><br /><strong>Task 1:</strong> Conduct an international literature search to identify applicable IR and GPR NDT technologies for assessing HMA density and segregation during construction activities.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Based on the findings from Task 1, evaluate and recommend the most promising NDT equipment and testing protocols for assessing HMA density and segregation during pavement construction. The recommendations need to include detailed evaluations of the practical performance values, such as speed, accuracy, precision, ease of use, etc. of these technologies/techniques for their successful implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Develop and submit to SHRP 2 detailed plans for field demonstration and validation of the recommended NDT techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Conduct a field demonstration of these techniques in one transportation agency and conduct validation of the results using core testing to determine actual densities.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Prepare and submit to SHRP 2 an interim report documenting Tasks 1 through 4. The interim report should include recommendations to demonstrate the techniques in the three remaining AASHTO regions. Additionally, the report should include any recommendations regarding modifications to testing procedures that could improve the performance of these technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Conduct field demonstrations in the remaining three AASHTO regions recommended in Task 5.</p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Document testing protocols and prepare training material for these technologies based on the lessons learned during the field demonstrations.</p>
<p><strong>Task 8:</strong> Prepare a draft final report documenting the entire project and submit to SHRP 2 for review.</p>
<p><strong>Task 9:</strong> Prepare and submit a revised final report that responds to review comments.</p>

<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R06-B <br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Evaluating Applications of Field Spectroscopy Devices to Fingerprint Commonly Used Construction Materials<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> July 29, 2008<br /><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); congestion reduction through improved travel time reliability (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years. <br /><br /><strong>Renewal Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to develop a consistent, systematic approach to completing highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and producing facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing and managing projects, and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal. The renewal scope applies to all classes of roads.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>Several DOTs have reported quality control issues with many of the materials routinely used in highway construction. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray florescence (XRF), and Raman technologies have recently been used for transportation materials on a limited basis, particularly for "fingerprinting" or identifying materials such as deicing compounds or anti-strip agents, and occasionally for quantitative analyses such as polymer content in asphalt and sulfate content of soils. There is the potential for much broader use of these technologies for other quality assurance tests, for example in testing cements, paints, thermoplastics, epoxies, asphalt emulsions and possibly many others. Using these new technologies, rather than traditional chemical tests, for such applications can allow faster, more accurate measurements.</p>
<p>Recently, many advances have been made in the equipment area. The chemical composition of typical materials requires developing acceptable spectra with laboratory based equipment. Very recently, however, low cost (around $20K) field hand-held devices have become available for validating that the delivered materials have similar chemical spectra to those obtained in the lab. These are point-and-shoot applications that could potentially be used by field technicians. If this technology is proven to be successful, individual deliveries of project materials can be tested prior to or during their use. The new equipment has become more available due to the lower cost of the devices and to software applications that allow easy interpretation of the results. Therefore, the potential use of these devices for a wider range of applications has become much more practical.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to identify and evaluate practical hand-held equipment such as XRF, FTIR or Raman-spectroscopy for quantitative analyses of applications such as:</p>
<p><br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quantity of anti-stripping agent(s) in asphalt concrete<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quantification of recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) content (oxidation of pavement) <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quality and uniformity of asphalt emulsions and neat binders<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; polymer content in asphalt binders<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quality and uniformity of curing compounds<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quality and uniformity of epoxy materials used for concrete spall repair<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quality and uniformity of cement and/or concrete.</p>
<p>An additional objective is to develop relatively simple and easy-to-use NDT procedures and protocols that inspectors and front-line personnel could use in the field to ensure quality construction. The results from the new methods should be easy to interpret.</p>
<p>For each application the research team will demonstrate in the laboratory how these technologies can capture the basic fingerprint of the material. It will also be necessary to determine the feasibility of using these technologies in the field on construction projects. The technologies and applications that appear most promising for implementation will be field tested.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><br /><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objectives. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time.

<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal <br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R06-F <br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Development of Continuous Deflection Device<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> July 29, 2008</p>
<p><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors.

<p>The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to develop a consistent, systematic approach to completing highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and producing facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing and managing projects, and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal. The renewal scope applies to all classes of roads.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>The selection of optimum rehabilitation strategies for distressed jointed concrete pavements is one of the biggest challenges that transportation agencies face. Hot-mix asphalt (HMA) overlays of concrete pavement are commonly used nationwide as a rehabilitation alternative but are considered a short-term solution because of the presence of reflection cracking. Other frequently used alternatives include joint replacement, dowel bar retrofit, and slab fracturing techniques. Key engineering information needed to develop the selection of optimum rehabilitation strategies includes the load transfer efficiency (LTE) at joints, structural uniformity, and void detection. This information can be obtained with traditional equipment such as falling weight deflectometers (FWD) but obtaining sufficient data with this device is slow, cost prohibitive, and exposes workers and the public to risk. Consequently only a very small percentage of the joints are tested on current rehabilitation projects. Quantifying the number and location of poor joints is critical in developing cost-effective rehabilitation strategies.</p>
<p>There exists a need to develop a device that can rapidly provide 100% coverage of existing joint condition in order to support development of long-lasting pavement rehabilitation designs. Several continuous deflection devices have been developed as alternatives to FWDs. While these devices offer the potential of 100% coverage at higher speeds (1 mph) as compared to an FWD, there remain concerns as to the cost and operational feasibility of such a device and the magnitude of the further developmental effort needed to make the devices practical for use on rapid renewal projects.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Objective</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this project is to critically assess the potential of existing continuous deflection devices as a practical and cost-effective tool for use in the development of optimum pavement rehabilitation strategies on rapid renewal projects. This assessment will examine:</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The potential demand by and value to public agencies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The technical capabilities (including accuracy and repeatability of test results and ability to provide meaningful data), limitations (field applications, equipment configuration, operating and safety characteristics), and other impediments to implementation of existing devices <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further development of the technology including both hardware and software needed to make these tools practical for use.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<p><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objective. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meet the research objective(s):</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Phase I</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Conduct a review of all published and unpublished literature and case studies to assess the state of practice and state of the art of continuous deflection devices used to assess pavement conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Conduct interviews with state DOTs to assess the demand and the potential value of continuous deflection devices for use in developing optimum pavement rehabilitation strategies for rapid renewal projects. The assessment should consider a variety of pavement types with a particular emphasis on jointed concrete pavements. The interviews shall include at least 3 states where such devices have already been used and 10 other states facing substantial renewal challenges on high traffic volume roadways where the devices are not currently in use.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Contact the owners of the existing continuous deflection devices to obtain sample data and explore opportunities for field evaluations on actual pavement evaluation projects. LTE is of particular interest but all capabilities of the devices should be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Based on the information from previous tasks prepare a plan for field evaluation of the devices that includes comparison with FWD data.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Develop and submit a Phase I Interim report detailing all of the work conducted in the preceding tasks and provide a draft work plan for Phase II. The draft work plan should identify all elements needed to achieve the project objectives and describe how all of the tasks in Phase II will be accomplished. The plan should also identify the proposed projects for the field evaluation.</p>
<p><em>The Phase I report for this project will be reviewed by the SHRP 2 Technical Coordinating Committee for Highway Renewal to consider the proposed work plan for Phase II, and to determine whether this contract should continue into Phase II.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Phase II</strong></em></p>
<p><em>After approval of the work plan developed in Phase I and on receipt of notice to proceed to Phase II, conduct the following tasks:</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Conduct field evaluation of the continuous deflection devices.</p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Analyze the data collected from the field evaluation to characterize the accuracy and repeatability of test results and the devices' ability to provide meaningful data.</p>
<p><strong>Task 8:</strong> Prepare and submit a draft final report documenting all of the findings. In addition the report must answer the following questions:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under what circumstances of need and cost would highway agencies use this technology?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the primary barriers to DOT use of these devices?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the test data accurate and repeatable?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do the devices to provide meaningful data to support pavement renewal decisions?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What limitations hinder the implementation of these devices? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What further development or refinement of the equipment and software to implement these devices is needed for wide spread use? What are the associated costs?</p>
<p><strong>Task 9:</strong> Prepare and submit a final report.</p>

<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal <br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R06-E <br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Real-Time Smoothness Measurements on Portland Cement Concrete Pavements During Construction<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> July 29, 2008</p>

Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years.</p>
<p><strong>Renewal Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to develop a consistent, systematic approach to completing highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and producing facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing and managing projects, and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal. The renewal scope applies to all classes of roads.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>Smooth concrete pavements have been shown to be more durable, have lower vehicle operating costs, and lower maintenance and rehabilitation costs. In addition, transportation agencies recognize the importance of smooth-riding pavements to the traveling public.</p>
<p>Most states have implemented smoothness specifications for concrete pavements. These specifications require measurements of surface profile on the finished pavement for acceptance testing. Currently smoothness measurements are not made until after the concrete has hardened and problems are not corrected in real time, resulting in significant expenditures to correct surface irregularities. Diamond grinding is typically done to improve ride quality, but this method of correction is costly and may create other problems (e.g. noise, appearance, texture, etc.).</p>
<p>Efforts to develop real-time smoothness measurements have already been made but there is a need for further development of a construction quality control tool for detecting surface irregularities during concrete paving operations. This technology has the potential to improve process control and allow for equipment and operations adjustments to correct surface irregularities while the concrete is still plastic, resulting in higher quality, lower cost, and faster construction that will minimize the impact on the traveling public.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to enable real-time control of concrete pavement smoothness during construction by providing: (1) proven technologies for measuring smoothness in real time; and (2) model specifications and guidelines for use by transportation agencies.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>SHRP 2 REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Reliability<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> L02<br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Establishing Monitoring Programs for Travel Time Reliability<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> July 29, 2008</p>
<p><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); congestion reduction through improved travel time reliability (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with a total program duration of 7 years. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Reliability Focus Area</strong> <br /><br />The overall goal of the SHRP 2 Reliability program is to reduce congestion through incident reduction, management, response, and mitigation. Achieving this goal would significantly improve travel time reliability for many types of person and freight trips on the nation's highways.<br /><br />Travel time reliability refers to how travel time varies over time and the impacts of this variance on highway users. In other words, for repeated travel or vehicles making similar trips, there is an underlying distribution of travel time for a particular type of trip within a specific time period between two points. Individual travelers respond differently to the factors and uncertainties associated with the travel time. So do those involved in freight transportation. For important trips such as a trip to the doctor or a just-in-time freight delivery, the driver (or possibly the freight dispatcher) will build extra time into the trip to ensure arrival within a time window with a high probability, for example 19 out 20 times (95% of the time). A considerable literature is evolving regarding performance measures of travel time reliability. For example, see the resources on travel time reliability available at the Federal Highway Administration's Operations website: <a href="http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/tt_reliability/TTR_Report.htm#Whatmeasures">http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/tt_reliability/TTR_Report.htm#Whatmeasures</a></p>
<p>According to previous research, seven major factors account for approximately half of all traffic delay, and therefore, a great deal of the uncertainty associated with travel time: (1) traffic incidents, (2) work zones, (3) weather (4) special events, (5) traffic control devices, (6) fluctuations in demand, and (7) inadequate base capacity. These factors do not always affect travel time reliability separately. They often interact, which increases the challenge of reducing the uncertainty of travel time that drivers experience.<br /><br /><strong>Project Background</strong><br /><br />Road users accept, although reluctantly, the everyday congestion inadequate road capacity causes and adjust their departure times accordingly to arrive at their destination on time. Road users are less tolerant of unexpected delays because of the consequences of late arrival. Road agencies and authorities have an interest, and responsibility to address the factors that cause unreliable travel. As a result, to an increasing degree, they are seeking to implement measures that would improve travel time reliability to support on-time arrival of individual travelers as well as freight and transit movements. Traffic monitoring systems are needed that can produce data on the variability (reliability) of travel time for passenger and freight movement, for different trip purposes, in peak and off-peak periods, and in different geographic and climatic settings with fundamentally different types of highway networks. This information is necessary for real-time operations of the highway system-to reduce non-recurring congestion, improve travel time reliability, and improve mobility in general. Also, archived travel time data, when transformed into travel time reliability measures, is valuable for planning, programming, and other purposes including research. Furthermore, related data on incidents, weather, and so on help explain the uncertainty associated with travel time and are critical for many types of travel time reliability analysis and model development.<br /><br />All state departments of transportation, most other road authorities, and some private entities have maintained traffic data collection programs for many years. These organizations have primarily relied on automated traffic recorders. However, these programs have generally supported highway planning and design or enforcement of regulations and have not been used on a regular basis to assess or research techniques or activities designed to improve travel time reliability. <br /><br />More recently, a large number of newer traffic data collection technologies have been put to use within the public and private sectors across the United States, including: inductive loops, closed circuit television with pattern recognition (e.g. license plate readers), inductive signature identification, toll tag readers, embedded wireless magnetometers, microwave radar, electromagnetic detectors, Global Positioning System receivers, cellular telephones, and other radio-based technologies. While not every detector technology provides speed and travel time determination capabilities, many of these technologies can provide data related to travel time reliability. The selection and deployment of specific technologies requires a system engineering process; the appropriate technology varies depending on climate, roadway type, physical characteristics of the roadway network, budget, and other factors. The diversity of technologies and operational environments is an important consideration for this research project.<br /><br />Thus, substantial experience exists regarding the design and implementation of traffic monitoring systems for both real-time applications (e.g. freeway traffic management) and more traditional statewide traffic monitoring programs. One of the key issues for this research is to determine the adaptability of these systems to gather information on travel time reliability for real-time operations management and for post hoc use of archived (historical) data, possibly augmented by special data collection programs, in other levels of decision making. <br /><br />There are other key issues regarding the handling of data useful for improving travel time reliability, whether for real-time operations or other purposes. These include quality control, algorithm development, and protection of privacy. Data storage, back-up, and security are important technical and institutional issues resulting from the very large amount of data accumulated by travel time reliability monitoring systems.<br /><br />As noted, among the seven primary factors that affect travel time reliability are incidents, weather, work zones, and variations in demand. Combining travel time data with data on the other (explanatory) variables is important in the design of a reliability monitoring system.<br /><br />The design of a travel time reliability monitoring system requires the use of statistics to develop a sampling plan for locating traffic detectors and collecting travel time data-this includes determining appropriate geographic and time scales. Statistical methods also provide insight regarding the selection, validation, and application of appropriate measures of travel time reliability, as well as for estimating models of travel time reliability that reflect key factors such as weather. Other issues include how to impute travel time data collected on one segment to adjacent segments or to nearby links and how to aggregate data from specific locations and events to higher levels such as corridors, regions, or even an entire state. Finally, a key focus in travel time reliability from the road user perspective (demand side) is the net effect on a user's trip through the network, i.e. on travel from origin to destination. Therefore, an exclusive focus on freeway segments is insufficient to meet this critical aspect of a travel time reliability monitoring program.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Objective</strong><br /><br />The objective of this project is to develop system designs for programs to monitor travel time reliability and to prepare a guidebook that practitioners and others can use to design, build, operate, and maintain such systems. The focus of this project is on travel time reliability, but it is important to be aware that traffic detectors acquire data not directly related to travel time reliability including operations, pavement design, safety analysis, and security. The data from the monitoring system(s) developed in this project-from both public and private sources-should include, wherever cost-effective, information on the seven sources of non-recurring congestion. Data from the travel time reliability monitoring system(s) can then be used to construct performance measures or to perform various analyses useful for real-time operations management as well as policy, planning, and programming, especially exploring tradeoffs between capital and operations expenditures. The guidebook must be more than just a compilation of existing processes and technologies, and it must address not just freeways but other types of roads, such as toll roads and urban arterials. <em>(See Special Note 1)</em><br /><br /><br /><strong><em>Phase I</em> - System Design Needs: Define User and Functional Requirements for Travel Time Reliability Monitoring Systems</strong><br /><br /><strong>Task 1:</strong> Inventory and assess existing traffic monitoring systems capable of generating distributions of travel time and incidence of non-recurring congestion. This task should include a review of the ways reliability data is currently being collected by transportation agencies and operators, how such information is being disseminated to roadway system users, and how it is being used for operational, tactical, and strategic decision making (or why this is not occurring). Include a literature review and other interactive ways (e.g. interviews) to gather information from those knowledgeable about the systems. This task shall produce a summary of advantages and disadvantages of existing systems, lessons learned, institutional and technical issues, and gaps. Include information available from other SHRP 2 Reliability projects <em>(See Special Note 2).</em> <br /><br /><strong>Task 2:</strong> Identify user needs (public sector, private sector, road users) that are to be met through a reliability monitoring program. Address user needs both with respect to real-time systems operations and management and for such activities as policy, planning, programming, and budgeting. This task should identify opportunities at the operational, tactical, and strategic levels for enhanced reliability information to improve agency and private-sector decision making, guide resource allocation, and more efficiently use the roadway system.<br /><br /><strong>Task 3:</strong> Characterize user needs identified in Task 2 with respect to the full range of operating, technical, and data environments along the dimensions listed below. Identify at least five combinations that are most representative of the typical environments encountered on roadways in the United States. (For example, one of these environments might be two-lane rural highway with little or no equipment for collecting real-time data). Also identify any less common operational scenarios that merit special consideration.<br /><br /><em>Access controlled corridors (e.g. freeways):</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Urban<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Data collection by segment<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Road-based data collection<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Legacy monitoring systems<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Real-time data<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Person travel<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Public systems</p>
<p><em>Corridors without access control (e.g. signalized arterials):</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rural<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Data collection for origins and destinations<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Vehicle-based data collection<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;New monitoring systems (in new locations and/or using new technology)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Archived data<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Freight Travel<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Private systems and public/private partnerships</p>
<p><br /><strong>Task 4:</strong> Define Functional Requirements.The contractor must fully specify the functional requirements for both real-time and archival travel time reliability monitoring systems. The process of defining functional requirements must include input from relevant stakeholders through focus groups or other suitable techniques. Functional requirements to be considered include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Builds on existing (legacy) and emerging detection technology and monitoring systems. Focuses on data and performance measures relevant to travel time reliability while recognizing broader or different objectives of existing traffic monitoring systems such as mobility and asset management. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides a means to communicate data and performance regarding travel time reliability collected from traffic detectors at specific locations to various users of the monitoring system(s). <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uses public and private sources of data as appropriate. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serves traffic monitoring needs of the public and, to the extent practical, the private sector. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stores travel time and other data concerning reliability (e.g. data on the seven sources of non-recurring congestion) in a data base in accordance with a metadata standard. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides for data transfer into the system and dissemination to users from the system. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uses appropriate telecommunications. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Builds on the efforts underway at FHWA regarding SAFETEA-LU Section 1201 that are aimed at developing a real-time information management structure for the National Highway System and other major arterials in metropolitan areas as well as transit systems. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Addresses freight and person trips. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supports computation and estimation of travel time reliability measures, including measures for individual roadway segments, roadway corridors, and key origin-destination pairs. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supports the compilation of data suitable for development, testing, and refinement of travel time reliability prediction algorithms for both real time and static (e.g. planning) applications. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides a means to impute travel time and travel time reliability information and performance measures to areas where traffic data is not available. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supports aggregation of localized travel time reliability to corridors, subsystems, and systems. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides a foundation for agencies/operators to monitor long- and short-term changes in the reliability performance of their roadway systems, and possibly compare them with peers. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides a means for real-time monitoring of equipment malfunction.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Prepare the Phase I Report. Thoroughly document the work performed under Tasks 1 through 4. Submit a Draft Phase I Report for review. Within 30 days SHRP 2 will provide comments. Prepare a Final Phase I report that responds to the comments of SHRP 2. The contractor may not proceed with work on Phase II without approval of SHRP 2.<br /><br /><strong><em>Phase II</em> - System Design Completion and Guidebook Preparation</strong></p>
<p>In this phase, the contractor will complete the system design and develop a guidebook describing the structure and possible components of a travel time reliability measurement system that meets the functional requirements and addresses the five most representative scenarios identified in Phase I. <br /><br /><strong>Task 6:</strong> Develop travel time sampling and data acquisition plans, including how to fill gaps and aggregate to higher level networks, for:<br />(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Real-time operations<br />(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archival and/or special-purpose data useful for planning, programming, prediction modeling, performance measurement, and similar purposes<br />(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data necessary to account for the seven sources of travel time variability that affect travel time data<br /><br /><strong>Task 7:</strong> Design monitoring systems that provide the ability to calculate performance measures related to travel time reliability and account for the seven sources that influence travel time reliability and the five or more operating, technical, and data environments identified in Task 2 for both of the following:<br />(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Real-time operations<br />(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uses of archival data.<br /><br /><strong>Task 8:</strong> Assess the design tradeoffs for real-time versus archived travel time data collection systems. At a minimum, consider operations management, economic (including lifecycle costs), technical, analytical, and institutional factors as well as the ability to satisfy functional requirements. Consider the methods and implications of converting sources of archived data (e.g. from automated traffic recorders) to real-time data. Address issues related to computation or imputation of data for environments where the density of data collection devices is low. Address equipment reliability issues.<br /><br /><strong>Task 9:</strong> Prepare a Draft Phase II Report that fully documents the results of Tasks 6 through 8. The Draft Phase II Report documents the completion of the design work and includes a detailed work plan, budget, and schedule for Phase III. Also, prepare and submit to SHRP 2 a Draft Unvalidated Guidebook on Monitoring System(s) for Travel Time Reliability. Within 30 days of receipt of the Draft Phase II Report and the Draft Unvalidated Guidebook, SHRP 2 will provide comments to the contractor. Prepare and submit the Final Phase II Report and the Final Unvalidated Guidebook within 60 days of receipt of the SHRP 2 comments. Work on Phase III may not proceed without approval of SHRP 2.<br /><br /><strong><em>Phase III</em> - Validate Monitoring Programs</strong></p>
<p>The contractor shall validate the procedures developed in the guidebook. At a minimum, the contractor shall demonstrate and/or validate a travel time reliability monitoring system for the following types of areas:<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Areas where no data are currently being collected <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Areas where there are some existing sources of travel time and other relevant data but the travel time data, in particular, are not fully representative of the highway network, sub-network, or corridor <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Areas where high density of travel time data collection is occurring, and selected additional relevant data is available <em>(See Special Note 3)</em></p>
<p>The contractor shall report on implementation issues: technical, analytical, economic, and institutional. Validate the monitoring program(s) using computer simulation and/or field tests. Where field tests are conducted, assess the degree to which the monitoring program(s) provide information that accurately reflects field conditions and, particularly, travel times.<br /><br />The proposer is being offered substantial flexibility regarding how to approach Phase III. The proposer should tailor the scope and focus of the travel time reliability monitoring system to be implemented and its validation to the proposer's budget for Phase III (see Funds Available, below).<br /><br />Some possible activities and areas of focus to consider in the validation phase are:<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using GPS and cell phone technologies <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using an ad hoc mobile network that communicates travel time/speed and reliability data from in-vehicle navigation devices to all other vehicles with the same or similar type of equipment <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Converting ATRs so they provide real-time and archival data <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using data loggers, controllers, or equivalent NTCIP software <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Combining travel time data and travel time distributions with interaction effects of the seven factors that influence non-recurring congestion.</p>

According to the provisions of Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 21, which relates to nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs, all parties are hereby notified that the contract entered into pursuant to this announcement will be awarded without discrimination on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or disability.</p>
<p>2. The essential features required in a proposal for research are detailed in the brochure entitled <em>A Manual for Conducting Research and Preparing Proposals for SHRP 2</em> (<a href="http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/shrp2/PreparingSHRP2Reports.pdf">http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/shrp2/PreparingSHRP2Reports.pdf</a> ).<br />Proposals must be prepared according to this document, and attention is directed specifically to Section IV for mandatory requirements. Proposals that do not conform with these requirements will be rejected.</p>
<p>3. The total funds available are made known in the project statement, and line items of the budget are examined to determine the reasonableness of the allocation of funds to the various tasks. If the proposed total cost exceeds the funds available, the proposal is rejected.</p>
<p>4. All proposals become the property of the Transportation Research Board. Final disposition will be made according to the policies thereof, including the right to reject all proposals.<br /><br />5. Proposals will be evaluated by SHRP 2 staff and Expert Task Groups (ETGs) consisting of individuals collectively very knowledgeable in the problem area. Selection of an agency is made by the SHRP 2 Oversight Committee, based on the recommendation from SHRP 2 staff and the ETG. The following factors are considered: (1) the proposer's demonstrated understanding of the problem; (2) the merit of the proposed research approach and experimental design; (3) the experience, qualifications, and objectivity of the research team in the same or closely related problem area; (4) the proposer's plan for participation by disadvantaged business enterprises-small firms owned and controlled by minorities or women; and (5) the adequacy of facilities. <br /><br />6. Any clarifications regarding this RFP will be posted on the SHRP 2 Web site at (<a href="http://www.trb.org/shrp2">www.trb.org/shrp2</a>). Announcements of such clarifications will be posted on the front page and, when possible, will be noted in the TRB e-newsletter. Proposers are advised to check the Web site frequently until <strong>August 26, 2008,</strong> when no further comments will be posted.<br /><br />7. A bidder's proposal is required to set out a management plan and a plan for quality control/quality assurance (QC/QA). The management plan should identify a person responsible for overall performance of the project, typically an officer of the prime contractor, and who has the authority to take corrective action; an organizational structure of the team with a description of the organizing principles; where and in what manner the key staff and experts will be applied to functions or tasks of the project; how coordination of subcontractors and subconsultants will be achieved; management of resources (budget, labor, equipment); and schedule adherence. The QC/QA plan should address how quality will be built in as the tasks are being executed and describe the oversight necessary to assure the quality of the products of the tasks and phases once they are largely complete.</p>
<p>8. The contractor is responsible for transfer of all electronic content of deliverables (word processing files, CDs, simulation runs, software) so it can be archived. SHRP 2 intends to establish procedures for transferring both structured and unstructured project data so it can be archived and disseminated. SHRP Project L13, Requirements and Feasibility of a System for Archiving and Disseminating data from SHRP 2 Reliability and Related Studies will determine if building an archive for all the Reliability and related research projects ought to occur. The initial requirements and feasibility study may provide a specification for transferring Reliability project data to a temporary repository.<br /><br /><br /><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Potential proposers should understand that the research project described herein is tentative. The final content of the program depends on the level of funding made available. Nevertheless, to be prepared to execute research contracts as soon as possible after sponsors' approvals, the Strategic Highway Research Program is assuming that the tentative program will become official in its entirety and is proceeding with requests for proposals and selections of research agencies.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Special Notes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note 1:</strong> This project is focused on monitoring systems to address travel time reliability and non-recurring congestion. However, because the systems can monitor both recurring and non-recurring congestion, they must be able to collect, store, and disseminate data related to causes of travel time variability. <br /><br /><strong>Note 2:</strong> Work performed under this project should be coordinated with other SHRP 2 projects through interviews and conversations with the research teams or the Principal Investigators. Of most importance is SHRP 2 Project L03: Analytic Procedures for Determining the Impacts of Reliability Mitigation Strategies. Project L06: Institutional Architectures to Advance Operational Strategies may be of some relevance. Proposers should bear in mind that work performed under Project L02 is likely to be used as input to and will be coordinated with SHRP 2 Project L04: Incorporating Reliability Estimation into Planning and Operations Modeling Tools; SHRP2 Project L05: Incorporating Reliability Measures into the Transportation Planning and Programming Process; and SHRP 2 Project L08: Incorporation of Non-Recurrent Congestion Factors into the Highway Capacity Manual Methods.<br /><br /><strong>Note 3:</strong> The validation plan must be realistic, taking into account the project funds and the portion allocated to Phase III. The three data regimes here can be addressed in a more or less integrated fashion within one or several operating, technical, and data environments defined in Phase I.<br /></p>

<DESC><p><br /><strong>SHRP 2 REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Reliability<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> L04<br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Incorporating Reliability Performance Measures in Operations and Planning Modeling Tools<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> July 29, 2008</p>
<p><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong><br /><br />To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); congestion reduction through improved travel time reliability (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million over a total program duration of 7 years. <br /><br /><strong>Reliability Focus Area</strong><br /><br />The overall goal of the SHRP 2 Reliability program is to reduce congestion through incident reduction, management, response, and mitigation. Achieving this goal would significantly improve travel time reliability for many types of person and freight trips on the nation's highways.<br /><br />Travel time reliability refers to how travel time varies over time and the impacts of this variance on highway users. In other words, for repeated travel or vehicles making similar trips, there is an underlying distribution of travel time for a particular type of trip within a specific time period between two points. Individual travelers respond differently to the factors and uncertainties associated with the travel time. So do those involved in freight transportation. For important trips, such as a trip to the doctor or a just-in-time freight delivery, the driver (or possibly the freight dispatcher) will build extra time into the trip to ensure arrival within a time window with a high probability, for example 19 out 20 times (95% of the time). A considerable literature is evolving regarding performance measures of travel time reliabilit4y. For example, see the resources on travel time reliability available at the Federal Highway Administration's Operations website: <a href="http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/tt_reliability/TTR_Report.htm#Whatmeasures">http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/tt_reliability/TTR_Report.htm#Whatmeasures</a>.<br /><br />According to previous research, seven major factors account for approximately half of all traffic delay, and therefore, a great deal of the uncertainty associated with travel time: (1) traffic incidents, (2) work zones, (3) weather (4) special events, (5) traffic control devices, (6) fluctuations in demand, and (7) inadequate base capacity. These factors do not always affect travel time reliability separately. They often interact, which increases the challenge of reducing the uncertainty of travel time that drivers experience.<br /><br /><strong>Project Background</strong><br /><br />Recent research evidence (see Special Note 1) suggests that travel time reliability is an element of a traveler's choice of departure time, route, mode, and perhaps, whether to travel at all. This implies that traffic conditions influence the demand for and nature of travel. Furthermore, as demand changes, travel conditions, including volumes, change on the network. While as travelers we know this to be true from our experience, traditional methods used to assign traffic to links of the network or forecast travel demand cannot cope with this degree of complexity. In order to make traffic patterns and travel demand forecasting sensitive to traffic conditions, there is a need to develop the underlying relationships between travel time reliability and travel demand and to upgrade analysis and forecasting tools accordingly. A new generation of models and computer analysis offers the potential, but the techniques have yet to be developed. <br /><br />In this Request for Proposals, models that use historical or static data to forecast one or more dimensions of travel are "planning models." Models applied to real time data in order to manage current conditions on the network are "traffic operations models."</p>
<p>Simulation models are often categorized into three types: micro-simulation, meso-simulation, and macro-simulation. Micro- and meso-simulation are of most concern here. In micro-simulation, the physical characteristics of vehicles, kinematics of motion, and models of driver behavior are used to move each vehicle in very small increments of time (e.g. second by second). However, ultimately the focus should be on the movement of people, not just vehicles, in order to link the simulation results back to the demand models.<br /><br />Dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) is a type of meso-simulation that can address time varying (dynamic) features of networks but DTA also includes aggregate relationships, such as speed, density, and flow to simplify computation. There are distinct versions of DTA for planning and operations management.<br /><br />The category of travel demand forecasting models includes traditional four-step approaches, discrete choice models, and activity-based approaches. Activity-based models may also include simulation. <br /><br />A fusion is in progress as some approaches to travel demand forecasting are incorporating traffic operations approaches and some traffic operations techniques have demand forecasting capability. There is also extensive on-going work to develop feedback between traffic conditions on the network and travel demand. <br /><br />The emphasis in Project L04 is on improving traffic operations and planning models to reflect travel time reliability and generate travel time reliability as a model output. Phases I and II focus on incorporating travel time reliability in such models. Phase III considers ways to account for the feedback between travel demand and traffic conditions on the network, such as traffic impedances including the variability of travel time.<br /><br />Extensive research and operational testing is underway by many parties on these topics, including related projects in SHRP 2. See Special Note 2. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Objectives</strong><br /><br />The objectives of this project are to (1) develop the capability of producing measures of reliability performance as output in traffic simulation models and planning models, and (2) determine how travel demand forecasting models can use reliability measures to produce revised estimates of travel patterns.<br /><br /><strong>Tasks</strong><br /><br /><strong><em>Phase I</em> - Background, Functional Requirements, and Representative Data</strong><br /><br /><strong>Task 1:</strong> Drawing on appropriate sources, identify and synthesize the fundamental issues that reflect the computation and treatment of travel time reliability in modeling tools. Describe primary measures of effectiveness related to travel time reliability. Draw on other SHRP 2 Reliability and Capacity projects. Also, examine work in NCHRP 08-57 and NCHRP 08-67 (See Special Note 3).<br /><br /><strong>Task 2:</strong> Define the functional requirements of stochastic network simulation models (hereafter referred to as traffic operations models) needed to estimate travel time variability, including but not limited to the following capabilities: <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Be able to get travel time distributions by link, segment, trip (O-Ds), and for the entire system. Reflect combinations of recurring and nonrecurring congestion found on real networks. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be able to quantify the change in travel time due to breakdown in flow (LOS F)<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be able to distinguish and model the variability of (1) recurring congestion (e.g. randomness of travel times in saturated flow), (2) nonrecurring congestion due to fluctuations in demand and the effects of traffic control devices, and (3) nonrecurring congestion due to such factors as incidents, weather, work zones, and special events.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide the flexibility to adapt to various agency and policy environments<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be able to replicate operations/traffic control strategies and traveler information systems<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide calculations of reliability performance measures among the outputs.</p>
<p>At a minimum, proposers must address reliability considerations in microscopic simulation models, although mesoscopic simulation models may also be considered within the scope of this project.<br /><br /><strong>Task 3:</strong> In order to provide meaning to variability in travel time, some baseline is needed. However, in saturated flow conditions, random events introduce variability that may be considered "normal" for the period. This calls for a formal approach to modeling random events. Develop a repeatable framework for evaluating incidents and events. The framework should be able to isolate three regimes: (1) time periods with recurring congestion (2) time periods of nonrecurring congestion due to variation in demand and the effects of traffic control devices; (3) time periods of nonrecurring congestion due to other factors such as incidents, weather, work zones, and special events.<br /><br />Submit a Technical Memorandum covering Tasks 1, 2, and 3.<br /><br /><strong>Task 4:</strong> Identify good candidate networks and model applications (i.e., simulation software available from vendors that has already been applied by transportation agencies for specific projects) that may be used to satisfy the requirements set out in Task 2. Document how the candidates satisfy the requirements. Consider partnering with one or more local agencies in carrying out the remaining tasks, particularly in Phase II. <br /><br /><strong>Task 5:</strong> Obtain data from public and/or private sources that can be used in Phase II for developing and implementing a simulation model that satisfies the requirements established in Task 2. The data should provide information on the distribution (i.e. variation) of travel time and other traffic flow variables on network links due to recurring and nonrecurring congestion over a lengthy period of time (six months minimum) and should cover both recurring and nonrecurring congestion on freeways and arterials.<br /><br />Submit a Technical Memorandum covering Tasks 4 and 5. <br /><br /><strong>Task 6:</strong> Prepare a Phase I Draft Report, including a work plan for Phase II. Revise and submit a Phase I Final Report based on the comments received from SHRP 2.<br /><br /><strong><em>Phase II</em> - Demonstration of a Traffic Simulation Model that Reflects Reliability in a Subarea of a Network and Preparation of Application Guidelines</strong><br /><br /><strong>Task 7:</strong> Adapt and calibrate an existing traffic simulation model with the functionality described in Phase I and apply it to a reasonably large subarea of an urban network. Alternatively, build and calibrate your own model and similarly apply it. Include in the subarea at least one urban freeway, system interchanges, and surface arterial roads. Make the simulation model internally reflect travel time reliability and produce one or more reliability performance measures as an output. Run the model using different random number seeds and calibrate the basic variability in travel time due to operations at saturation, e.g. recurring congestion. Validate that the model reflects the real-world variability associated with recurring and nonrecurring congestion.<br /><br /><em>Note: If you know of an approach for establishing feedback between traffic conditions on the network and travel demand as discussed in Phase III, feel free to propose it here. We are looking for creativity from proposers.</em> <br /><br /><strong>Task 8:</strong> Use the inputs and results from earlier tasks to demonstrate the inclusion of travel time reliability in the application of the simulation model in Task 7. Demonstrate the model to practitioners, researchers, operations managers, and planners in transportation agencies and at conferences and meetings. Run scenarios that address the causes of nonrecurring congestion. Show how sensitive the reliability outputs are with respect to key inputs and how traffic flow characteristics are sensitive to reliability.<br /><br /><em>Note: in the proposal describe an outreach plan for the demonstrations.</em> <br /><br /><strong>Task 9:</strong> Develop <em>Application Guidelines for Incorporating Travel Time Reliability into Traffic Micro-Simulations</em>. The application guidelines should not be software-specific. The guidelines shall be a stand-alone document. Submit a draft. In response to comments received from SHRP 2, submit the Final <em>Application Guidelines</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Task 10:</strong> Prepare and submit to SHRP 2 a Phase II Draft Report that documents the results of Tasks 7 through 9. Document model calibration and validation consistent with standard practice, for instance as described in either the FHWA or CalTrans Guidelines for Applying Micro-Simulation Software. The Phase II Draft Report should be accompanied by spreadsheets with the analytics, a CD ROM with the software and the models that were run, and geo-coded data where applicable. Include two draft PowerPoint presentations covering Project L04, one for practitioners who adapt and use traffic operations models and the other for planners, operations managers, and decision makers. Document any new intellectual property developed using contract funds (Refer to <em>Manual for Conducting Research and Preparing Proposals for SHRP 2</em> for information regarding rights in data and intellectual property). Within 30 days SHRP 2 will provide the contractor with comments regarding all the draft deliverables. Incorporate the responses to the comments into the Final Phase II Report and the final versions of all other deliverables and submit them. The Final Phase II Report shall document the results of all project tasks.<br /><br /><strong><em>Phase III</em> - Incorporating Reliability into Travel Demand Forecasting Models and Addressing Feedback with Simulation Models</strong><br /><br /><strong>Task 11.</strong> There is great interest in linking travel demand forecasting to traffic micro-simulation so that traffic conditions can feed back to choices about travel time, travel route, travel mode, or the decision to travel at all. Describe how a feedback mechanism could incorporate travel time reliability into traditional trip-based travel demand models, emerging activity-based models, and route choice models. Detail how reliability could be introduced into the generalized cost function (may apply to one or more of the following: generation, distribution, mode choice, route choice). <br /><br />In 2009, SHRP 2 Capacity Project C10 will call for proposals from transportation agencies to actually establish part of this linkage, i.e. linking travel demand forecasting to micro-simulation. The product of Task 11--due to exploring feedback relationships between travel forecasting and simulation models--will provide background for Project C10. Prepare a stand-alone Phase III Draft Report on this topic and submit it to SHRP 2 for review. This task does not have to be conducted in sequence with the others. Submit the draft as early in the project as the work permits. SHRP 2 will provide comments within 21 days. Prepare and submit a Final Phase III Report that reflects the comments of SHRP 2.<br /><br /><strong>Special Notes</strong><br /><br /><strong>Note 1:</strong> Brownstone, D., and K.A. Small (2005).

For example, Project L02 will develop a reliability monitoring approach applicable to freeway and arterial segments, corridors, subarea networks, and an entire highway network.<br /><br /><strong>Note 3.</strong> Project L04 and related projects within the Transportation Research Board are seeking to strengthen simulation tools and demand models. The contractor for Project L04 must be cognizant of and coordinate with related research that is occurring both within SHRP 2 and the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP). Reliability Project L04 may benefit from the relationships being developed under Reliability Project L03: Analytic Procedures for Determining the Impacts of Reliability Mitigation Strategies, and Reliability Project L02: Establishing Monitoring Programs for Travel Time Reliability. Reliability Project L11: Evaluating Alternative Operations Strategies to Improve Travel Time Reliability will address reliability performance measures and targets for different classes of road users as well as the value of reliability. All these projects are likely to produce inputs into Reliability Project L05: Incorporating Reliability Performance Measures into the Transportation Planning and Programming Processes.<br /><br />Within the SHRP 2 Capacity Focus Area, Project C04: Improving Our Understanding of Highway Users and the Factors Affecting Travel Demand will develop models of user response to congestion, travel time reliability, and pricing. This project should satisfy many of the needs for a new demand modeling framework that addresses reliability, especially if pricing is involved. Capacity Project C05: Understanding the Contributions of Operations, Technology, and Design to Meeting Highway Needs is concerned with combinations of operations-related actions that are equivalent to adding a lane of highway capacity. Capacity Project C05 also involves preparation of guidelines for achieving sustained service rates that are not subject to breakdown in flow, and thus avoid nonrecurring congestion due to the interaction of base capacity and fluctuations in demand. Capacity Project C10: Partnership to Develop an Integrated, Advanced Travel Demand Model and Fine-Grained Time Sensitive Network has substantial resources to refine, strengthen, and expand the scope of models developed in other parts of the Reliability and Capacity focus areas. <br /><br />NCHRP Project 8-57: Improved Framework and Tools for Highway Pricing Decisions, has some relevance to Reliability Project L04 since it will provide an overall approach and key considerations that will address appropriate demand forecasting tools for highway pricing decisions. NCHRP Project 8-67: Integrating Individual Transportation System-Level Performance Programs to Determine Network Performance potentially relates to certain aspects of L04 and other projects in the Reliability research program.<br /><br /><strong>Deliverables</strong></p>

<p>4. All proposals become the property of the Transportation Research Board. Final disposition will be made according to the policies thereof, including the right to reject all proposals.<br /><br />5. Proposals will be evaluated by SHRP 2 staff and Expert Task Groups (ETGs) consisting of individuals collectively very knowledgeable in the problem area. Selection of an agency is made by the SHRP 2 Oversight Committee, based on the recommendation from SHRP 2 staff and the ETG. The following factors are considered: (1) the proposer's demonstrated understanding of the problem; (2) the merit of the proposed research approach and experimental design; (3) the experience, qualifications, and objectivity of the research team in the same or closely related problem area; (4) the proposer's plan for participation by disadvantaged business enterprises-small firms owned and controlled by minorities or women; and (5) the adequacy of facilities. <br /><br />6. Any clarifications regarding this RFP will be posted on the SHRP 2 Web site at (<a href="http://www.trb.org/shrp2">www.trb.org/shrp2</a>). Announcements of such clarifications will be posted on the front page and, when possible, will be noted in the TRB e-newsletter. Proposers are advised to check the Web site frequently until <strong>August 26, 2008</strong>, when no further comments will be posted.<br /><br />7. A bidder's proposal is required to set out a management plan and a plan for quality control/quality assurance (QC/QA). The management plan should identify a person responsible for overall performance of the project, typically an officer of the prime contractor, and who has the authority to take corrective action; the Principal Investigator and any Co-Principal Investigators; an organizational structure of the team with a description of the organizing principles; where and in what manner the key staff and experts will be applied to functions or tasks of the project; how coordination of subcontractors and sub-consultants will be achieved; management of resources (budget, labor, equipment); and schedule adherence. The QC/QA plan should address how quality will be built in as the tasks are being executed and describe the oversight necessary to assure the quality of the products of the tasks and phases once they are largely complete. <br /><br />8. The contractor is responsible for transfer of all electronic content of deliverables (word processing files, CDs, simulation runs, software) so it can be archived. SHRP 2 intends to establish procedures for transferring both structured and unstructured project data so it can be archived and disseminated. SHRP Project L13, Requirements and Feasibility of a System for Archiving and Disseminating data from SHRP 2 Reliability and Related Studies will determine if building an archive for all the Reliability and related research projects ought to occur. The initial requirements and feasibility study may provide a specification for transferring Reliability project data to a temporary repository.</p>

<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Capacity<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> C08<br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> A Community Visioning Approach to Support the SHRP 2 Collaborative <br />Decision-Making Framework for Highway Investments</p>
<p><strong>Date Posted:</strong> July 29, 2008</p>
<p><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); improved travel time reliability through congestion reduction (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years. Additional information about SHRP 2 can be found on the program's Web site at <br />"http://www.trb.org/shrp" <a href="http://www.trb.org/shrp2">www.trb.org/shrp2</a>.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Capacity Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>The objective of the Capacity focus area is to develop a consistent framework for reaching balanced, collaborative decisions on enhancing transportation capacity and to provide the tools for applying the framework. The research will develop a transportation project evaluation process to help stakeholders balance the need to reduce delays caused by conflicting demands with the need to produce transportation solutions that support community, economic, and environmental goals. The research will also develop a structure for a project's many contributors to share data and knowledge. This will require identifying critical points for decision making in various processes, the data and knowledge required for these decisions, and successful methods of sharing information.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Linkage to Other SHRP 2 Projects</strong></p>
<p>One of the fundamental products of the SHRP 2 Capacity research program will be a Collaborative Decision Making Framework (CDMF). The objective of this framework is to develop a systems-based, transparent, well-defined framework for consistently reaching collaborative decisions on transportation capacity enhancements. The framework will address about 50 key decision points (KDP) in six core transportation decision processes:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Systems planning <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-program studies (e.g., corridor studies)<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programming <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Environmental Review<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Permitting</p>
<p>A key decision point is one at which approvals and signoffs are required before the process can advance. SHRP 2 Project C01 is developing the framework and the results of other SHRP 2 Capacity projects, including this one, will be integrated into the framework, creating a unified product for users.</p>
<p>SHRP 2 Project C02 is developing a performance measurement framework, emphasizing environmental and community measures that inform the collaborative decision-making process. Project C02 will create a web-based library of performance measures that will be linked to the key decision points and will aid in selecting measures appropriate in each. (See Special Note 1)<br /><br />SHRP 2 is the Strategic <em><strong>Highway</strong></em> Research Program, but being strategic about highway capacity investments means full examination of highway design, transit, pedestrian, and non-motorized alternatives within the collaborative decision-making process. These are appropriate topics for consideration in C08.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>The Collaborative Decision-Making Framework being developed by SHRP 2 Project C01 needs a visioning "front end" that provides a forum in the decision-making framework for dealing with difficult trade-offs. The visioning approach should embody the findings of community impact analyses so that participants in the process can "see" the positives and negatives as they work through choices. The approach should embody new technologies as appropriate, but not forget the power of an interactive community session. Visioning may be carried out at the intersection level or at the state/ regional level. The appropriate approaches should be linked to Key Decision Points in the CDMF It is not expected that this project will build a visioning system from scratch, but it should identify systems in use or in development and show how an agency can use them or build their own system from the available "parts."</p>
<p>Visioning is used here as a collective term for consensus-building regarding the larger context in which transportation projects, including additions to highway capacity, are meant to serve. It means more than traditional public information approaches such as media coverage, public meetings, or hearings. It is also more than "visualization," more than "scenario planning," and more than "context sensitive solutions." Visioning as used in this RFP is an interactive process, facilitated by a public agency that engages stakeholders to ensure that the transportation decision-making process includes the larger goals and visions of the community.</p>
<p>Making transportation investments is a complex and often long process that affects many stakeholders and requires collaboration among many agencies. Highways and all transportation investments serve the economy of a region and provide mobility for all social purposes. As such, they are part of the fabric of a community.</p>
<p>When population growth, changes to the economic baseline, or revitalization require new transportation investments, stakeholders speak out about what their community should become. However, they do not all speak with one voice. Transportation investments have positive and negative long-term effects and affect various elements of the community differently. Often a debate needs to occur about growth, how growth should happen, what modes of transportation should be built, where they should be built, protecting the environment, stimulating the economy, protecting historic and cultural resources, improving pedestrian safety, and preserving farmland. Without commonly held reference points, these discussions often founder because the benefits and dis-benefits to a community's future can not be satisfactorily estimated. A shared community vision can provide these reference points.</p>
<p>Primary, secondary, and cumulative effects, both positive and negative, should be part of the debate. Hindsight tells us that secondary and cumulative impact can cause more damage to many communities than the primary impacts, a fact which many communities intuitively understand better than do transportation agencies. SHRP 2 Project C03 is investigating the primary, secondary, and cumulative economic effects of highway investment. Information from that project will be available to the C08 research agency, so it is not necessary to do research on economic benefits in this project. However, social and cultural issues should be documented in Project C08 so awareness can be embedded in the visioning process.</p>
<p>Transportation investments are expensive and money is always in short supply. The stakes are high. Failure to act can destine a state or an urban area to slow economic decline. Taking an approach that does not have substantial community support can lead to opposition as can failure to properly address environmental and social questions. All such forms of opposition can cause delay and cost escalation.</p>
<p>There is a strong feeling developing now in transportation agencies across the country that if something needs to be built, it should not be delayed. If it's the wrong project, change and move on. Twenty-year project delivery schedules are wearing thin. If transportation investments cannot be delivered in a reasonable time, community support, project continuity, and political continuity may be lost. The ability to finance may also slip away. For these reasons, it is important to make the right decisions as early as possible and to develop and maintain community support to deliver a successful project. Visioning is a tool that can help.</p>
<p>Even the most successful visioning efforts have had trouble connecting long-term, broad visions to decision-making processes that support transportation planning and project development. This is understandable given the challenges inherent in visioning: <br /><br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The long timeframes associated with visioning are difficult to reconcile with shorter-term priorities and requirements. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tools, technologies, and analysis used in the visioning process can be difficult to link with the decision support tools used in traditional planning efforts. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integrating land use, transportation, environmental, and other elements of a vision involves multiple jurisdictions (and agencies) each with their own planning process, objectives, and requirements. When a regional vision of the future is needed, boundaries must be overcome.</p>
<p>Experience indicates that as a project moves through the processes of planning, design, and construction and becomes an operating facility the early commitment to a consensus vision can be eroded by subsequent decisions made without knowledge of the original consensus. Tasks of building internal partnerships and commitment tracking through project delivery and facility operation are seen as important adjuncts to the visioning process itself.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this research is to develop an effective community visioning process for transportation investment that is integrated into the collaborative decision-making framework. The visioning process should be flexible, able to be applied at state and local levels, followed through project selection, design, and delivery, and should consider primary and secondary effects that the project will have on communities and neighborhoods. <em>(See Special Note 1)</em></p>
<p><br /><strong>Tasks</strong> <br /><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objective. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meet the research objective(s):</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Using appropriate information-gathering techniques, describe the lessons learned from application of visioning in various stages of highway planning and design in the post-1993 (ISTEA) time period. Why was visioning done? What agency sponsored the effort? How were disparate issues such as economic growth, the environment, health, housing, highway needs, and transit needs resolved? What did and did not work to engage the community? Compile lessons learned and success factors from prior community visioning efforts that will inform the visioning approach developed in the project. This task provides the material for analysis in the rest of the project. <em>Review the case studies completed under SHRP 2 Project C01 for visioning material. (See Special Note 2)</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Using appropriate information-gathering techniques, investigate and describe the primary, secondary, and cumulative effects of highways that may impact communities. For instance, a highway widening might clearly subtract 12 feet of frontage from properties on each side, however the longer term effects created by increased traffic volumes and speeds can ultimately be more damaging. When combined with impacts created by other projects, the cumulative effects on a community can be substantial and historically have not been addressed properly by the transportation agencies.. Prepare a working paper on Tasks 1 and 2.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Building on Tasks 1 and 2, identify tools and techniques to educate, engage, and energize the following in the visioning exercise:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Traditional Stakeholders-transportation agencies and those directly affected by a project or plan<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hard-to -reach stakeholders such as disadvantaged populations, real estate developers, industry, freight companies, commuters, and contractors<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Resource agencies</p>
<p>Describe how the tools and techniques can help stakeholders understand tradeoffs and make informed choices. For example, how can awareness of the primary effects of a highway be communicated? How can the more speculative and abstract secondary and cumulative effects be envisioned? How do you achieve informed consent? Possible tools include: one-on-one dialog; group activities; and technology-assisted visioning.</p>
<p><em>Task Product:</em> Prepare a draft guide to help practitioners select the appropriate tools for various visioning situations and audiences. (This will become a section the practitioner's guide to be developed in Task 7.) Submit the draft to SHRP 2 for review and approval.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Conducting a visioning process requires both external and internal partners. External partners are needed because a visioning exercise may be lead by any number of institutions; a state DOT, an MPO, a city, or a county. A strategy is needed to present one unified face to the public. Internal partnerships are needed because the highway capacity components of the vision will generally be carried out by the state DOT. (In some cases, it may be a municipality or special authority.) The agency responsible for designing and building the capacity expansion requires internal partnerships to maintain continuity and to implement the vision.</p>
<p>Identify and describe methods to establish external partnerships to ensure that the results of the visioning exercise are linked to the collaborative decision-making framework. Identify and describe methods to establish internal partnerships to ensure that the results of the visioning exercise result in projects true to the vision.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Describe a commitment tracking process(s) supported by performance measurement to ensure that core principles from the vision are incorporated and embodied in project delivery. Describe and develop other strategies for implementing the outcomes of visioning. Consider: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Innovative practices that have been used or considered<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Barriers to agency implementation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Methods to deliver accountability to the community, e.g., briefing new elected officials.</p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Prepare a business case for visioning. Estimate costs and direct and indirect benefits. This should include such items as:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Personnel and financial resources typically needed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Organizational structure needed to support successful visioning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Time and money saved in the project delivery process<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does visioning: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Increase community support?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Decrease the likelihood of lawsuits?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lead to better transportation solutions?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Improve the perception of the transportation agency?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Improve trust?</p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Building on prior tasks, develop a model process (or several for various situations) for conducting community visioning related to transportation investments that can be applied or adapted to all phases of the CDMF. The process should describe how to apply approaches, tools, and techniques across the stages of the CDMF. Prepare a draft stand-alone Practitioner's Guide in appropriate media that incorporate the findings of the project. Also prepare the materials in an electronic format that can be directly integrated into a web-based CDMF that will incorporate the results of many SHRP 2 projects. Submit to SHRP 2 for review.</p>
<p><strong>Task 8:</strong> Following approval, vet the draft Practitioner's Guide through a process to be determined by the proposer to validate linkages to key decision points in the CDMF. Target state DOTs, MPOs, and other appropriate local governments. The Guide should include an executive summary that describes the outcomes, business case, and benefits of visioning and how it can be implemented through the CDMF.</p>
<p><em>Note: in the proposal describe the approach you plan to use.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 9:</strong> Incorporate revisions based on Task 8 and prepare a final Practitioner's Guide in the recommended media. Document study findings in a draft final report, and following review, a subsequent Final Report. The Final Report should describe the research process employed and substantiate the foundation of the Practitioner's Guide. It is not intended to be a summary fo the Practitioner's Guide. <br /><br /><strong>Task 10:</strong> Develop an electronic-based training product to assist in integrating the outcomes of visioning with the CDMF.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Requirements of the Research Team</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Experience and demonstrated success with community visioning in various stages of transportation planning and design<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experience in applying innovative technologies for achieving informed consent in transportation and other applications<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experience in community impact analysis</p>
<p><strong>Special Notes</strong></p>
<p>1. The Collaborative Decision-Making Framework is the product of SHRP 2 Project C01 and also the framework to which many SHRP 2 Capacity results will be attached in a large, web-based product. This product is the result of 16 case studies and six focus groups. While it is not absolutely final yet, it is sufficiently mature to serve as the framework for Project C08. By the time C08 starts, the CDMF will have been vetted in each of the AASHTO regions and will be complete.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) Clause 3052.209-70, Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates (JUN 2006) (Continued).

 (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.

(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.



Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) Clause 3052.209-70, Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates (JUN 2006) (Continued).

 (d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011. 

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 12 August 2008, 4:15 p.m., EST.     All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.     Anticipated award date is on or about August 22, 2008. Contact Tamela Bunting at Tamela.S.Bunting@uscg.mil or 252-335-6815 for questions regarding this solicitation.     Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above address, facsimile copies are acceptable and should be faxed to 252-335-6790, or at the following address:

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.

(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

 HSAR 3052.20970  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

On January 9, 2005, the Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) officially ending Africas longest running civil war.  Over the course of the 21-year conflict, fighting, famine, and disease killed more than 2 million people, forced an estimated 628,000 people to seek refuge in neighboring countries, and displaced more than 4 million people within Sudanthe largest internally displaced person (IDP) population in the world.  In April 2003, a separate conflict began in Darfur, Western Sudan, when the locally based Sudanese Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) attacked GOS security forces in the city of El Fasher.  The resulting humanitarian emergency in Darfur affects an estimated 2.6 million people, approximately 40 percent of the population, including 1.9 million IDPs and 220,000 refugees in eastern Chad.  The concurrent emergencies have exacerbated already fragile humanitarian conditions, and challenged local capacity to provide for the population.

DCHA staff in Sudan work as part of the USAID Mission in Sudan.  DCHA staff in Khartoum includes representatives from OFDA, the Office of Food for Peace (FFP) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI).  OFDA requires two Program Officers, who may be assigned to Khartoum, Juba, other parts of Sudan, or the region, depending on needs.  He/she will report to the OFDA Country Representative for Sudan and coordinate regularly with OFDA colleagues in Sudan and the OFDA Sudan team in Washington, D.C.  This includes sharing project ideas, strategies, and soliciting advice and guidance.  He/she will work with a small team of experienced Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs) specializing in the areas of food security, health, gender, and livelihoods.  Each FSN  staff member is also responsible for a specific geographic area and specific grants.

OBJECTIVE

OFDA must recruit Program Officers for Northern and Southern Sudan in order to meet its program objectives.  The incumbent will serve as a point of contact for OFDA in the field and is responsible for contributing to the development of strategies and plans, reviewing proposals, monitoring grants, liaising with grantees and other members of the humanitarian community, and reporting on the humanitarian situation.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Program Officer will provide full time in-country coordination of the humanitarian response for Southern Sudan or northern Sudan (including eastern Sudan and the Three Areas of Abyei, Nuba and Southern Blue Nile).  The Program Officer may assist in humanitarian assistance activities in all parts of Sudan as needed.

The Program Officer must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly abide to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.

	Assess a broad spectrum of emergency conditions to provide recommendations, implementation strategy, monitoring, and evaluation of OFDA response programs.
	Coordinate closely with the OFDA Team in Khartoum and other field offices, and maintain a daily liaison with United Nations (UN) agencies, International Organizations (IOs), Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs), and other organizations conducting humanitarian activities in the AOR.

Provide overviews of patterns and trends in the humanitarian situation and keep the OFDA Country Representative for Sudan and the Sudan Team in Washington current on response issues.  
	Prepare agendas and briefings for official U.S. Government visitors interested in humanitarian issues.
	Under the guidance of the Administrative Officer, provide day-to-day supervision for locally engaged staff, administrative oversight at the field office level, and coordinate travel itineraries for very important persons.
	As requested, assist U.S. Embassy staff with humanitarian assistance matters.
	Operate OFDA communications and data processing equipment, including satellite telephones, cellular type mobile phones, and hand held radios.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item, prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. NSR-08-508 herein is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-14.  This is not a small business set aside.  This RFP is for full and open competition.  

----------------------------------------
BACKGROUND
In April 2001, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) revised 10 CFR 50.47(b)(10) of its emergency preparedness regulations.  The revised rule requires that States with population within the 10-mile emergency planning zone of commercial nuclear power plants, consider including potassium iodide (KI) as a protective measure for the general public to supplement sheltering and evacuation in the unlikely event of a severe nuclear power plant accident.  Concomitant with this action, the NRC offered to provide a supply of KI to each State or Tribe that incorporated KI for the general public into their emergency plans.  If local governments were designated by the State, NRC also offered to provide a supply to the local governments.  In addition to providing the initial supply of KI, NRC agreed in September 2006 to provide replenishment of the potassium iodide for those States currently providing it for populations within the 10-mile (EPZs) of commercial nuclear power plants.

---------------------------------------
OBJECTIVE 
The Contractor shall provide shipments of 65 mg KI tablets produced by an FDA-approved manufacturer, in the quantities and to the locations designated by the NRC Project Officer (PO).

---------------------------------------
SCOPE OF WORK 
The Contractor shall supply and distribute Potassium Iodide (KI) tablets as ordered by the NRC.

--------------------------------------------
CONFIGURATION OF POTASSIUM IODIDE TABLETS
Each 65 mg KI tablet shall be manufactured by an FDA-approved manufacturer and must be an FDA approved product.  Each tablet shall be scored-in to enable the user to break the tablet into at least two pieces.  Each 65 mg KI tablet shall have the maximum FDA-approved shelf life from date of acceptance by the NRC or the State or Tribe to which delivery was made.  Each tablet shall be individually packaged.

--------------------------------------------
TASK 1 
SUPPLY POTASSIUM IODIDE TABLETS 
The contractor shall provide NRC orders of 65 mg KI tablets, as ordered by NRC.  The estimated amount that will be required for this contract is 3,900,000 tablets.  This figure is provided as an estimate only.  The NRC is not obligated to order the estimated number as a minimum, nor as a maximum amount stated herein.  

-----------------------------------------------
TASK 2 
DISTRIBUTION 
The contractor shall ship the specified number of KI tablets, to the locations identified in the email at the time the order is placed.  The contractor shall maintain records of the shipping logs, showing quantities sent, receiving organization and proof of delivery.  A copy of these documents shall be provided to the NRC PO no later than five (5) calendar days from the date of delivery.  KI tablets shall be provided in a manner which provides ease of distribution, packaging, and storage; and maintains the shelf-life integrity of the tablets, once provided to the State or Tribe.  As a matter of redistribution and tamper avoidance, individually packaged or blister packaged tablets are the preferred method in packaging the tablets.  The NRC estimates that three deliveries will be required to three different states.  However, the NRC is not obligated to order any estimated number of distributions as a minimum, nor as a maximum amount stated herein.      

 ---------------------------------- 
DAMAGED/CRUSHED TABLETS 
The Contractor shall replace, at no cost to the NRC, any tablets that have been damaged or crushed during shipping.  The NRC will provide claims for replacement no later than 45 calendar days after delivery.  The Contractor shall replace the damaged/crushed tablets no later than 90 calendar days from receipt of NRCs notification.

--------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
BILL-TO AND SHIP-TO ADDRESS REQUIREMENTS 
The Contractor shall ship the tablets to various locations specified by the NRC PO, while maintaining one overall Bill-to Account.

<DESC>Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor (PSC) Officer-in-Charge (Montenegro)


The USAID Mission for Serbia and Montenegro (USAID/SM) promotes political and economic development in Serbia and a newly independent Montenegro.  A sovereign nation since 2006, Montenegro is working to ensure a stable democratic transition and to secure long-term stability and economic prosperity.  The U.S. supports Montenegro in its efforts to consolidate democratic and economic reforms as well as its rapid integration into the wider Euro-Atlantic community.  To address these efforts, USG assistance to Montenegro includes activities to improve governance and implementation of economic reforms.  Activities in these two areas focus to improve democracy structures, civil society, and private sector conditions in economically vulnerable areas such as in the North.

USAID/SM requires contracted services of a development assistance professional with strong leadership and management skills to guide the USAID assistance program in Montenegro.  S/he will lead the start-up of a major sustainable tourism initiative and will manage the successful phase-out of other elements of the assistance program with a goal of USAID phase-out in Montenegro by 2012.  The contract for the Montenegro OIC position will be for a period of two years. The position will be based in Podgorica, Montenegro and will require periodic travel to Belgrade, Serbia for administrative support and coordination with USAID/SM Mission management.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established five permanent regional offices and one sub-regional office.  The regional offices are located in San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; and Pretoria, South Africa.  The Asia sub-regional office is in Kathmandu, Nepal.
The OFDA/Asia offices cover the AsiaPacific region, which includes twenty-six countries in South, Southeast, and East Asia and sixteen Pacific Island nations. This also includes the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which will soon receive disaster assistance from USAID, in transition from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The region of responsibility is comprised of rich and poor nations, and politically stable and failing states.  It is a region of diverse cultures, languages, topographies, and disaster vulnerabilities.

OBJECTIVE

The Asia Regional Team requires the services of a Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) for the Asia-Pacific Region, based in its Bangkok, Thailand office. This position requires an experienced practitioner in disaster response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. The incumbent is responsible for managing the Asia Regional Office and supervising its staff, development of the three-year Asia strategy, coordination of disaster response activities, and for the identification and formulation of disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs primarily in the Asia region.  

The PRA will actively develop and coordinate preparedness, mitigation and training programs to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region.  Frequent travel within Asia and the Pacific region will be required.


9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

2) Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation - Working closely with OFDA/W and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the PRA will assist representatives of host government organizations, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.

Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA/W Asia team colleagues, will: 

	Prepare (and supervise the preparation of) regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries;

	Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance for OFDA, USAID, local governments, and other donors/organizations, as appropriate;

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.  

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful and a failed transition.

OTI's strategic objectives are based on the premise that fast, direct, and overt political development assistance is needed as a catalyst to move countries beyond crisis to stability. When a crisis occurs in a priority country, OTI has the ability to engage in that country and initiate a country program. A country program is designed to address the fundamental constraints prohibiting the country from emerging from crisis. 

USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. The typical OTI country strategy follows US Government policy and directly involves: reshaping hard-line attitudes and perceptions; promoting democracy, human rights, and basic freedoms; disseminating objective information; and effecting positive political change -- wherever and whenever possible.

OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society, development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation, identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs, and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate, OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/.

INTRODUCTION

In November 2007, USAID/OTI launched a new program in Pakistans Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The Government of Pakistan (GOP) is focusing efforts to bring security and development to FATA, demonstrating a new commitment to the FATA through the creation of the FATA Secretariat (FS), and more recently the FATA Development Authority (FDA), to attract investment to the region. In 2007, the FS produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) through which the GOP intends to bring sustained development to the region. The GOP has pledged a billion dollars to the SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States. 

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), manages a program called the FATA Transition Initiative (FTI) aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc. In addition, the program is undertaking media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information the FATA communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.

The purpose of this contract is to fund a Field Program Manager to support USAID/OTIs FATA Transition Initiative in Pakistan. The Field Program Manager holds a management position primarily responsible for coordinating monitoring, evaluation, and reporting of activities within the overall FTI program. The Field Program Manager position will be responsible for the training and management of the FTI programs monitoring, evaluation and reporting staff and resources and will advise the FTI program on the conceptualization, design and implementation modalities necessary to deploy such in a complex, non-permissive, and highly sensitive political environment. The Field Program Manager should be prepared to direct, manage and personally supervise the work of the individuals and organizations under his/her authority without the benefit of directly visiting FTI grant activity sites within Pakistans Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).  

The position is a tandem/ladder position. Applicants may submit applications for more than one position/grade level, but must submit a separate application for each. Applicants will be accepted/denied based on the position to which they applied (e.g., an applicant for the GS-13 position may not be accepted for a GS-12 position/grade level). If hired at the GS-12 equivalent level, the selected employee may be eligible for promotion to the GS-13 equivalent level. Promotion to the GS-13 level is not guaranteed, and may only occur after working a minimum of 12 months at the GS-12 level, and after receiving a recommendation for promotion by the supervisor as part of an excellent performance evaluation.  

OBJECTIVE

The objective of hiring for this position is to support the OTI Pakistan program.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Field Program Manager will work closely with OTI implementing partner organizations in the management of relevant program monitoring, evaluation and reporting resources to devise strategies meant to interpret and use information for the general benefit of improving the tactical, programmatic and strategic impact of FTI. The Field Program Manager must demonstrate problem-solving skills and the ability to implement creative approaches at monitoring and evaluating the FTI programs activities in order to advise the OTI Country Representative and other members of the Senior Management Team of ways to improve the programs activities and modalities.  Due to the rest and recuperation (R&R) schedule, the Field Program Manager can expect to periodically assume, in addition to his/her own duties, the responsibilities of one or both the OTI Deputy Country Representative and the OTI Country Representative. The Field Program Manager must demonstrate professional maturity and ability to effectively represent OTI to the high volume of delegations consistently visiting Pakistan. The Field Program Manager must also demonstrate personal maturity given the pervasive proximity of peers and supervisors in both professional and social settings at all hours of the day.  Because of the likeliness of changes in program direction and implementation, the Field Program Manager must be a highly flexible individual capable of redesigning his/her roles and responsibilities. 

The successful candidate must also be willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success.

The Field Program Manager is a member of the DCHA/OTI Asia Middle East Regional Team and will be based in Peshawar, Pakistan. Due to the unpredictable security situation, it is important to note that Pakistan is a non-accompanied post, and movement of USG personnel, including USPSCs, is heavily restricted.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The five CIS-WS-C3560E-48TD-E have been selected to facilitate the ESX hosts, Physical Servers, and iSCSI shared storage that will be installed in SA-3. This hardware will allow for our current capacity needs as well as for future expansion. From the onset we will be able to provide a 2GB network backbone for the servers as well as provide for a backbone upgrade to 10GB in the future without having to replace the switches. Each server will have a 1GB connection to the network. The IOS (Operating System) installed on these switches provide IPv6 switching functionality that is a Federal Agency wide requirement. The below quoted text is a section from the State Department IPv6 Transition Plan prepared by IRM/OPS/ENM/NED. 
OMB Memorandum 05-22 directs agencies to begin transitioning their network backbones to IPv6 by ensuring their network backbones are capable of processing IPv6 network addresses and passing IPv6 traffic (e.g. operating a dual stack network core, operating in a pure IPv6 mode) by June 30, 2008.  Furthermore, agency networks are required to interface with the upgraded network backbone, while maintaining continuity of operations and security before, during, and after an agency transitions to IPv6 in an operational environment. The backbone includes the WAN up to the LAN point of demarcation.  The LAN demarcation point is the device (e.g. router, switch) that services the workstations.
The document referenced above can be found here http://enm.irm.state.gov/IPv6/Trans_Plan.doc  
Purchasing the iSCSI SAN in conjunction with the CIS-WS-C3560E-48TD-E will eliminate the need to purchase additional Fibre Channel Switches that can only be used to connect the servers to the SAN (Storage Attached Network) and not for normal network switching. The Cisco switches we have requested will provide for iSCSI SAN connectivity without the need to purchase the aforementioned Fibre Channel Switches. This provides for a considerable cost savings. <BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Heitech Services, Inc to provide and format for publication reports documenting work on a significant long-term project.  The project involves formatting for publication the reports documenting the investigation of the collapse of World Trade Center 7.  This work is part of the federal building and fire safety investigation of the World Trade Center disaster led by NIST.  NIST is currently working to complete the investigation and anticipates preparing a summary report on the investigation of WTC 7 and two detailed reports on the investigation, including appendices documenting specific technical topics that were part of the investigation.  The drafts of these reports are expected to be completed in the summer of 2008 and ready for formatting at that time.  NIST will also need some graphics work for the covers of the reports and the labels on the Compact Disks (CDs) containing these reports.  

Sole source determination is based on Heitechs specific experience since the contractor has worked on prior versions of the remaining reports and is uniquely positioned to complete the remaining tasks within the tight time frame.

REVISED: The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 518210 Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services and the size standard is $23M.

REVISED: No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received on or before July 31, 2008; 12:00:00 AM Eastern Standard Time.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposal acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

QUESTION 7
[Ref.: Draft Contract Exhibit A Draft Operating Plan 3C 'Vessel Requirements' pp. A-4 to A-6]  The solicitation requires that, after the first 24 months of the 10 year contract, services are performed with a single vessel with a seating capacity of at least 200.  At this time only one of the two Permit holders, Yankee, has such a vessel already. As such, any offeror without such a vessel already will have to make a substantial investment in designing and building a permanent vessel.  While a new vessel should be significantly more economical and far less polluting than any existing vessel, the current specifications for the permanent vessel clearly provide Yankee with a significant unearned advantage.
Further, by requiring that during the 24 month interim period the services that currently are being provided successfully by the two existing permit holders with two vessels (Yankee's large vessel and Sunny Days moderate size vessel) must be provided with one or two boats of a combined minimum seating capacity of 175, NPS is also requiring all offerors other than Yankee to make yet another significant investment in one or more vessels, the cost of which cannot possibly be amortized over the 24 months during which they will operate.  The combination of investments that the solicitation requires of all offerors other than Yankee makes the current solicitation unduly and unnecessarily restrictive of competition.
To remove restrictions on competition, would NPS eliminate the requirement for the concessioner to operate during the interim operating period, extend the two current contracts as need be, and set the start date for contract performance with the final vessel configuration to be up to 24 months after award? Or, in the alternative, would NPS ease the capacity specifications during the interim period to allow more flexible approaches that don't require an unrecoverable investment?  
NPS RESPONSE:The NPS developed the vessel requirements for the Draft Contract in compliance with 36 C.F.R.  51.6.  This regulation specifies that the NPS Director must not develop terms and conditions in a concession contract to accommodate the capabilities or limitations of any potential offeror.  With respect to the foregoing requests, the NPS is not eliminating the requirement for the concessioner to operate during the interim operating period; extending the two current authorizations; and modifying the start date for contract performance; or, in the alternative, revising the vessel requirements in the Draft Contract.  Decisions concerning vessel requirements were made during the prospectus development process. Considerations included, without limitation, financial, operational, and visitor comfort concerns.  Offerors should review the Prospectus documents, determine the requirements of the Draft Contract, and respond to the Proposal Package questions in the Prospectus as written.  
QUESTION 8
[Ref.: Draft Contract Exhibit A Draft Operating Plan 3C 'Vessel Requirements' pp. A-4 to A-6] Since the prospectus requires vessel capacities of 151 persons or more, and that requirement causes more strict screening of passengers both by the city of Key West and MTSA is it your intent that offerors make provisions for such screening (and the cost thereof) in their proposals?
NPS RESPONSE:As shown on the enclosed Errata Sheet, CC-DRTO001-08, the NPS has revised the original requirement for the Primary Vessel to have a United States Coast Guard Certificate of Inspection (COI) for a minimum of 200 passengers.  The COI requirements are specified in Exhibit 18 on page 20 of the Business Opportunity section and in subsection 3) C) (2) on page A-5 of the Draft Operating Plan.  The revised portion of the COI requirements specifies a minimum of "150" passengers.  
QUESTION 9
(Ref.: Proposal Package pp. 3 and 25] In Primary Selection Factor 1a, the bidders' air and water pollution and vessel emissions control measures are evaluated, and although this Subfactor states, "Fuel efficiency of engines and the maintenance of boat engines also impact the environment," the proposed vessels' fuel efficiency is not one of the five requested evaluation points. Although Secondary Selection Factor 1 states, "The NPS objective is to reduce emissions from vessel operations," the fuel efficiency of the vessels, which directly affects total emissions, is not requested there or elsewhere in the selection factors. Considering its driving importance, wouldn't the NPS reasonably back up its objective by requesting and evaluating bidders' vessels' fuel consumption? NPS RESPONSE:As shown on the enclosed Errata Sheet for DRTO001-08, the NPS has revised the Proposal Package, Principal Selection Factor 1, Subfactor 1a, Air and Water Quality, Page 4, by adding a new item 6 related to engines and fuel efficiency.
QUESTION 10
[Ref.: Draft Contract Exhibit A Draft Operating Plan 3C 'Vessel Requirements' pp. A-4 to A-6] By specifying a single large Primary Vessel, the prospectus immediately precludes the cleanest emissions vessels, because (1) a single large (e.g., over 200 passengers) vessel will use dramatically more fuel in one run than the amount used in two runs from a smaller (e.g., less than 150 passenger) vessel, and (2) the capacity specification in the prospectus may disallow light construction vessels (i.e., other than aluminum or steel) due to USCG guidelines for vessel certificates over 150 passengers. By not allowing bidders enough flexibility to propose the cleanest vessels, the prospectus thus will result in total emissions that are substantially higher than necessary and even higher than the current combined operations - contrary to its stated principles of reducing emissions. Will the NPS consider more flexible Primary vessel specifications that actually permit designs that will reduce emissions rather than increase emissions? NPS RESPONSE:The NPS has considered the request to change the Primary Vessel requirements and is not revising the Prospectus to accommodate the request.  Decisions concerning vessel requirements were made during the prospectus development process. Considerations included, without limitation, financial, operational, and visitor comfort concerns.  Offerors should review the Prospectus documents, determine the requirements of the Draft Contract, and respond to the Proposal Package questions in the Prospectus as written.  
QUESTION 11
Ref.: Proposal Package p. 22; and Draft Contract Exhibit A Draft Operating Plan 3C 'Vessel Requirements' pp. A-4 to A-6] By specifying a single large Primary Vessel, the prospectus unavoidably will result in higher passenger fares, as fuel consumption at ever-increasing fuel prices will cost more than alternate vessel designs under 150 passenger capacities. However, the lower the fare, the more people can afford to visit the Park. Since the Park's General Management Plan states that "The NPS intent is to keep the cost of visiting the park as low as possible so as many visitors as possible can visit," wouldn't the NPS reasonably have selection factor elements that evaluate the bidders' proposed passenger fares, to help ensure this intent? What will be the initial passenger fare? NPS RESPONSE:Subsection 36 C.F.R. 51.18 (c) authorizes the NPS to include subfactors under the principal and secondary selection factors to describe specific elements of the selection factor.  The NPS has determined it is not appropriate to revise the Proposal Package in response to Question 11.  Offerors should review the Prospectus documents, determine the requirements of the Draft Contract, and respond to the Proposal Package questions in the Prospectus as written.  With respect to the initial passenger fare required under the Draft Contract, please see the draft Operating Plan" page A-2, 3A and B.

QUESTION 12
[Ref.: Draft Contract Exhibit A Draft Operating Plan 3C 'Vessel Requirements' pp. A-4 to A-6]  Must the interior sound level be specified so low - at 70 decibels - when there are no vessels available that could test to this specification?  For comparison, we measured sound decibel levels in the low 80s in cars driving down the road with air conditioner on low.
NPS RESPONSE:Decisions concerning vessel requirements, including decibel levels, were made during the prospectus development process. Considerations included, without limitation, financial, operational, and visitor comfort concerns.  Offerors should review the Prospectus documents, determine the requirements of the Draft Contract, and respond to the Proposal Package questions in the Prospectus as written.  
QUESTION 13
[Ref.: Draft Contract Exhibit A Draft Operating Plan 3C 'Vessel Requirements' p. A-5] The prospectus requires an active ride control system on the final Primary vessel. However, available active ride controls (t-foils, interceptor plates, active trim tabs) dramatically increase fuel consumption (often by 20% or more) and can be prohibitively expensive (t-foils may add up to a half million dollars to a vessel cost.) Interceptor plates are ineffective at the specified speed range of 26 knots. Some active ride controls, such as t-foils, have such serious maintenance issues that they can endanger the vessel rather than improve its stability. Further, active ride controls offer little or no advantage to vessel designs with length-to-width ratios over 14:1 except in a very narrow range of sea conditions. Rather than imposing a blanket requirement for active ride controls, will the NPS consider allowing Primary vessel designs that use passive design features to achieve improved stability instead of active ride controls?
NPS RESPONSE:As shown on the enclosed Errata Sheet for DRTO001-08, the NPS has revised the equipment requirements located in the Business Opportunity Section, Exhibit 18, and Page 20, and in Exhibit A, Page 20.  The revised equipment requirements include a passive ride control system as an option or in addition to an active ride control system.  In addition, the NPS has also revised the Proposal Package, Principal Selection Factor 2, subfactor 2b Vessels, 1, Page 7, by adding a new information requirement(o) Description of the vessels active/or passive ride control system(s).
QUESTION 14
[Ref.: Draft Contract Exhibit A Draft Operating Plan 3C 'Vessel Requirements' p. A-4] For the Interim vessel, will the NPS consider allowing a two-vessel plan in which one of the two vessels has a 90 passenger capacity, although the combination of the two vessels meet all other currently stated prospectus requirements (including the requirement for a combined minimum capacity of 175 passengers)?  
NPS RESPONSE:  The NPS has considered the request to alter the Interim Vessel requirements and is not revising the Draft Contract to accommodate the request.  Decisions concerning vessel requirements were made during the prospectus development process. Considerations included, without limitation, financial, operational, and visitor comfort concerns. Offerors should review the Prospectus documents, determine the requirements of the Draft Contract, and respond to the Proposal Package questions in the Prospectus as written.  
QUESTION 15
[Ref.: Draft Contract. Since the Services Contract Act (SCA) normally would apply to contracts such as this one, has the NPS received a DoL exemption from the Services Contract Act for this competition?
NPS RESPONSE The NPS believes the Services Contract Act does not apply in the circumstances presented by this concession opportunity.  However, if it is determined that this Contract is subject to the Service Contract Act, then pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 of this Contract, which requires compliance with all Applicable Laws, the appropriate provisions of the Service Contract Act will be incorporated into this Contract. To: All Recipients of the prospectus: CC-DRTO001-08- A Concession Business Opportunity for round trip passenger ferry service between Key West, FL and Dry Tortugas National Park and other specified services
NPS RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY YANKEE ROAMER
QUESTION 1
Referring to Contract Exhibit A (Draft Operating Plan), section 3(B) (Rates), subsection (1) (Initial Rates): "Rates in effect at the time of the publishing of the prospectus are included in the Appendix to the Prospectus."
Appendix G to the Prospectus (2008 Rates for Current Operators) shows Yankee Freedom II rates for adults as $149.00.
As of May 2008, our rates for adults aboard Yankee Freedom II are $159.00. A reduction in rates for financial projections would not be favorable and would cause undue financial hardship. Can Appendix G be revised to reflect the actual approved 2008 rates which includes a fuel surcharge?
NPS RESPONSE:The rates were changed on April 1, as shown in the enclosed Errata Sheet No. 1, Appendix G has been revised to reflect the operator's current rate of $159.00.
QUESTION 2
There are no provisions that we can find in the Prospectus and its attachments to allow for frequent adjustments for fuel surcharges. The uncertainty of the price of fuel is totally beyond the control of any concessioner. Further, the cost of fuel is a major expense. Without some method of quickly adjusting to fuel costs, it places the economic viability of this concession contract in question.  Annual adjustments are not reasonable because fuel price escalations take place almost daily.
We request that the National Park Service allow a fuel surcharge that is keyed to the average price of fuel in Key West.
In the same vein, insurance costs are also beyond the control of the concessioner and we would ask if the rates could be adjusted automatically, annually, to reflect any increase of insurances with proof of said increases.
NPS RESPONSE:The NPS Rate Approval guide was provided to all Offerors as Appendix B of the Prospectus.  The National Park Service is required by law to approve all rates charged to the public by park Concessioners and to ensure that those rates are comparable to similar goods and services provided outside of the park.  Concessioners may request rate increases for factors deemed relevant, including but not limited to additional transportation charges for food, gasoline or other products due to distances from suppliers.  The Concessioner is responsible for providing documentation to justify the rate increase. The National Park Service will make every effort to respond quickly to these rate requests.  The National Park Service is currently researching how the private sector is handling rapidly changing fuel costs for services.  A policy has not been developed so we cannot address the issue of a surcharge at this time.
QUESTION 3
Referring to Contract Exhibit A (Draft Operating Plan), section 4(F) (Transportation from Garden Key to Loggerhead Key), subsection (a) the National Park Service has stated that the concessioner does not have to provide this service if there are fewer than six paying customers. In subsection (b), the National Park Service stated that no more than six passengers will be transported on a daily basis. Pursuant to this request, we have a number of questions:
a. Under these circumstances, is this service only required when there are six paying customers and optional when fewer than six?
NPS RESPONSE:The Draft Contract authorizes, but does not require, the Concessioner to provide daily transportation service from Garden Key to Loggerhead Key.  Each trip is limited to six passengers and the Concessioner may provide one trip per day.  The second sentence in subsection 4) F) (a) states that "This service need not be conducted with fewer than six (6) paying customers."   Thus, if the Concessioner elects to provide this authorized service and the Park Service incorporates applicable provisions in the Operating Plan, then the Concessioner has made a commitment to provide the service as specified.  The commitment would continue until the Concessioner elects to alter or discontinue the authorized service, in which event the Park Service would change the Operating Plan accordingly and the Concessioner would change the promotional materials as necessary.  Once the commitment to provide the daily service is made, however, if fewer than 6 people reserve space for a trip scheduled for a given day, the Concessioner may elect not to make that particular scheduled trip.  Potential patrons would need to be made aware of this contingency prior to paying for the trip.  The Concessioner would also need to ensure customers know how and when information would be conveyed to them if the scheduled trip is to be cancelled.
b. As long as the investment is being made in the vessel, why is it limited to only six people per day? Should not the boat be available to make several trips?  
NPS RESPONSE:  The final General Management Plan Amendment Environmental Impact Statement, located at the following web site:  http://www.nps.gov/drto/parkmgmt/upload/drtofgmpeis.pdf  identifies visitor use restrictions at Loggerhead Key.  The Commercial Services section on page 64 states, "Loggerhead Key tours would be limited to 12 visitors and subject to the use restrictions described on table 1."  Table 1 in this document on page 41 further explains the restrictions for numbers of visitors arriving via the Concessioner's vessel. 
c. Additionally, the Business Opportunity section, Exhibit 19 (Vessel Minimum Requirements for Inter-Island Transportation) states that the vessel must be inspected for a minimum of six passengers plus required crew. Is this correct? Does this, then, preclude the option of providing this service for less than six paying passengers as noted above? Perhaps this specific requirement in Exhibit 19 should have been stated as a maximum number of passengers plus crew.
NPS RESPONSE:As shown on the enclosed Errata No. 1 for DRTO001-08, the NPS has revised the requirement for a Certificate of Inspection (COI) for the inter-island vessel.  The capacity requirements are specified in the Business Opportunity, Exhibit 19, page 21 and Contract Exhibit A: Draft Operating Plan, Section 3 C (3).  The revised capacity requirements in these sections do not include a requirement for a COI.
QUESTION 4
Again referring to the Business Opportunity section, Exhibit 19 (Vessel Minimum Requirements for Inter-Island Transportation) states that the vessel must be capable of a minimum of 30 knots sustainable loaded speed.
a.  Is it necessary to design and build a boat and power system for 30 knots for this service given the proximity of Loggerhead to Dry Tortugas? Speeds this high may be very injurious to the natural resource and place at risk the passengers in such a small boat. If higher speeds are necessary for other purposes of this vessel, what would they be? If there are no other purposes, why would the National Park Service include this specification and expect the concessioner to commit the additional costs to provide a feature that is not expected to be used?
NPS RESPONSE:As shown on the enclosed Errata No. 1 for DRTO001-08, the NPS has revised the requirement for a minimum of 30 knot sustainable speed.  The minimum speed requirements are specified in The Business Opportunity, Section 19, page 21 and Contract Exhibit A: Draft Operating Plan 3 C (3), page A-6.  The revised speed requirements specify a minimum of 15 knot sustainable speed. 
b. Please define 'storage' for the vessel as shown on Contract Exhibit PC-6.
NPS RESPONSE:   Contract Exhibit C: Assigned Land and Real Property Improvements references a general location for securing an inter-island vessel.  If a Concessioner determines that they wish to offer this authorized service, further discussions will be held with the Concessioner on specific locations and how the vessel will be secured.
c. We would like to ask the NPS to reconsider the requirement of a diesel engine. While we recognize the relative environmental impact of diesel vs. gas, a diesel engine will denote a very heavy boat that is difficult to take out of the water if that is what is meant by 'storage' i.e. does that mean it will be pushed up on to the beach, have a rail system or use a trailer and puller? Furthermore, in the event of mechanical difficulties, a diesel engine will require the removal of the boat back to the mainland for repairs or bringing a mechanic out to the Dry Tortugas. It occurs to us that this is unwieldy and not a very user-friendly solution to this requirement. We respectfully would like to ask the question whether or not we could substitute the diesel requirement for a simple 4-stroke engine for which we could have a spare in the case of breakdowns.
NPS RESPONSE:As shown on the enclosed Errata No. 1 for DRTO001-08, the NPS has revised the requirement specifying a diesel fueled operated propulsion engine.  The equipment requirements for the inter-island vessel located within The Business Opportunity Section, Exhibit 19, Page 21 and Exhibit A, Equipment, page A-6 are modified as follows:  after the statement requiring "diesel-fuel" add "or gasoline fueled four stroke engine."  
Exhibit E, Section 3) A) (6) (a) on page 14 is modified as follows: delete the first sentence and replace with "if the authorized transportation service to Loggerhead Key is agreed to by the concessioner, and the concessioner utilizes a diesel fuel propelled engine for this service, the NPS will provide diesel fuel at the fort for the inter-island vessel only.  At the end of the last sentence in Exhibit E, Section 3) A) (6) (a) on page 14 add the following:  "Gasoline will not be provided at the fort nor will the concessioner be allowed to carry containers of fuel on board the interim vessel(s) or the primary vessel due to NPS safety concerns. The Concessioner must make other provisions for delivering gasoline to the inter-island vessel."  
The specific method of transferring the vessel to and from the beach will be determined by the Service if the successful Offeror determines that they wish to provide this authorized service.  A trailer and puller are anticipated to be the most likely option.  
d. We do not understand the request for Coast Guard COI requirement as this is not a requirement for a 6-passenger boat. Please explain.
NPS RESPONSE:Please see the response to question 3.  As shown on the enclosed Errata Number One for DRTO001-08, the NPS has revised the requirement for a Certificate of Inspection (COI) for the inter-island vessel in the applicable sections of the prospectus.

Description

PROJECT NOTICE

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), a Division of Midwest Research Institute, which is operated under Prime Contract DE-AC36-99GO10337 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to solicit competitive proposals from prequalified sources for a Design-Build subcontract for design and construction of a laboratory and office facility called the Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF) project. The ESIF will be located at NRELs South Table Mountain site in Golden, Colorado. The ESIF is envisioned to be the NREL and DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energys (EERE) and DOE Golden Field Office (GFO) signature building at NREL for energy technology integration research and engineering and is a high visibility project of national scope. It is intended that the ESIF construction final completion be no later than September 2011. The firm fixed price with award fee for the design-build effort will be negotiated prior to subcontract award and is currently estimated to be approximately $70,000,000 to $75,000,000 of which approximately $22,000,000 is associated with equipment procurement and installation.  A majority of the funding has been secured for this project.     

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK

The ESIF will provide the research, engineering, design, testing and analysis of components and systems to enable economic, reliable integration of renewable electricity generation, fuel production, storage, and building efficiency technologies with the U.S. fuels and electricity delivery infrastructures. The ESIF will also include a state-of-the-art high performance computing and data center. It will support improved and expanded capabilities in modeling and simulation of renewable energy and energy efficient technologies and their integration into the existing energy infrastructure.  The ESIF will provide laboratory and research capabilities for a broad range of renewable energy generation capabilities to include:
	Solar  Interconnection, Power electronics, Building Integration and system optimization
	Buildings- Sensors & Controls, PV and other systems integration, Modeling and Simulation
	Hydrogen  Electrical interfaces, Electrolyzers, Storage, Standards, Fueling Systems, Fuel Cell Integration
	Wind  Models, wind generation and grid interaction, grid analysis
	Vehicle Technologies  Hybrids and vehicle to grid integration, battery thermal management, power electronics
	Biofuels  Generator sets and Engines
	Energy Storage  Electrical and thermal
	
To accomplish this research, the ESIF will provide space for engineering, testing, optimization, and verification research needed for integrated energy systems.  It will accommodate a high performance computational capability of a minimum of 100 Teraflops with a planned expansion capability of 1000 Teraflops in future years.  It is NRELs intention to procure the computer separately, therefore, the computer itself will not be purchased under this planned subcontract.  To support the research the ESIF will include offices and shared areas to support a constant staff of approximately 200 personnel and include special spaces such as: conferencing capabilities, guest offices, and other institutional spaces that facilitate collaboration between NREL/DOEs private, academic, and public sector partners.  In addition, outdoor pads will be provided for testing larger equipment and systems up to the multi-megawatt scale. 

The ESIF is required to be a showcase of sustainable high-performance design that will demonstrate the integration of high performance building design and practices, showcase technology advances and capture industrys attention for renewable and energy efficient technologies for this type of facility.  The ESIF is required to incorporate the best in energy efficiency, environmental performance, and advanced controls using a whole building integrated design approach and must comply with Energy Star standards.  In support of the Department of Energys goal to demonstrate energy efficient buildings with a lower impact on the environment the facility itself will be designed to merit at least a LEED Gold rating from the U.S. Green Building Council, which will be the highest certified facility of its type with a high performance computing data center as a major part of the building.  

To support NRELs mission, the facility anticipates having the following features:

	Approximately 20 - 30 laboratories and research areas of various sizes each with different missions, construction requirements and operational hazards.  To support this effort the design-build contractor will need to be proficient or have subcontract expertise in electrical distribution system design; hydrogen production, delivery and storage; high performance computing and energy efficient data centers; and electrical, electromagnetic and vibration isolation and control methods.
	A high performance computing and data center capability that has sufficient room to support the computer as stated above, all periphery equipment, and enough space to allow for a future, redundant 1000 Teraflop computer.
	Approximately 5 outdoor and roof top test pads that will be integrated into the building for testing and monitoring purposes.
	Approximately $22 Million of research equipment that the Design-Builder will be required to have experience in so as to procure and install the following:
&#61607;	Electrical and Grid simulators (wind turbine, PV, utility grid)
&#61607;	Electrical distribution test circuit 
&#61607;	Hydrogen Research equipment (fuel cell, dispenser, compressors, electrolyzers, storage)
&#61607;	Test Pads and Test Cells (roof mounted and ground based photovoltaic , vehicle chamber) 
&#61607;	Load banks and test busses (AC, DC, Motor load) 
&#61607;	Other (surge tester, electrical sources, dynamometer, metrology equip, etc.)


PREQUALIFICATION PROCESS

NREL has determined that design-build firms must be prequalified to submit a proposal for this project.  Prequalification will be determined by NRELs panel review of the information submitted in response to this Pre-solicitation Notice, in accordance with the technical criteria provided below.  NREL will establish a short list of approximately three firms determined to be most qualified to perform the project successfully.  NREL will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to the prequalified firms and those firms will be invited to submit a comprehensive proposal inclusive of an architectural concept with basic functional systems development to meet the requirements for DOEs Critical Decisions 1, 2 & 3, schedule/technical proposal/price and other pertinent information as detailed in the RFP.  Oral presentations are planned and possible site visits may be required as part of the proposal.  A single firm will be selected for award based on a best value evaluation of proposals received in response to the RFP.  The unsuccessful teams will be awarded a stipend (to be determined) for their efforts. 

The RFP will request a proposal for a two phase process the first of which will include the cost and schedule associated with a Preliminary Design which will include collaboration between the successful design-build proposal team and the owner/end-user, as well as definition, negotiation, and approval of a complete scope, firm-fixed price, and schedule.

Prophet provides the force protection capability of monitoring COMINT, detecting, locating, identifying and direction finding Radio Frequency (RF) emitters in the Commanders tactical area of interest. Prophet will also conduct Electronic Attack (EA) operations against selected targets.  Prophet operates against targeted emitters that are found on the battlefield in a major regional conflict, military operations other than war and in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).  This is a competitive acquisition to produce, test, validate, deliver and support the services and products associated with the Prophet Spiral Enhanced (SE) System.  The SE System, as described in the Prophet Spiral Enhanced System Performance Specification, shall provide an increase of capability over existing Prophet Spiral 1 Electronic Support Sensor.  To maintain relevancy on the battlefield and keep pace with technology advancements, a product improvement program, consisting of Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and Technology Insertions (TI), shall be used to insert planned improvements and new unplanned capabilities into SE systems and Spiral 1 Electronic Support Sensors during the contract.  In addition, the retrofit of Prophet Spiral 1 Electronic Support Sensors to the Prophet SE configuration (s) is planned under this contract. Prophet Spiral Enhanced Systems Program is intended to satisfy the Prophet Sensor Army Procurement Objective (APO) in the most cost effective combination of procured Prophet Spiral Enhanced Systems and/or retrofit of Prophet Spiral I ES Sensors.  The system shall be mounted on Government Furnished Property (GFP) M1165A1 w/B3 High Mobility Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), or other light/medium or heavy vehicle at the discretion of the Government.  This effort will be a six (6) year (five-year base with a one-year option), Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract.  In addition, there will be Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) line items and Time and Material (T&M) line items for P3I, TI, and support service efforts.  The planned acquisition of Prophet Spiral Enhanced System and Product Improvement has an estimated program ceiling of $866 million.  Prophet Spiral Enhanced Systems will be procured as part of the basic contract.  The Prophet Spiral 1 ES Sensors/Spiral Enhanced Systems will be upgraded to the Prophet Spiral Enhanced System configuration (s) when funding is available. Product Improvements will be done to maintain Prophets relevancy.
