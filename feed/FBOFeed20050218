<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for (1) One - Dynamic Interferometer System (2) One – Transmission Flat (3) One – Adjustable Vertical Mount, (4) Two - Operator's Manuals and (5) One – Training Session . NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from 4D Technology Corporation of Tucson,AZ, on a sole source basis due to the fact that the detail of the design and manufacture of the interferometer are proprietary to 4D Technology Corporation.  The Government is not aware of any other companies that meet the technical requirements for this procurement.   4D Technologies makes an instantaneous phase shift interferometer which is virtually vibration insensitive.	This is extremely critical to the type of measurements required by the JWST Microshutter Project.  Without this new groundbreaking technology, high accuracy measurements of wafer and die contour cannot be reliably made without employing costly and bulky vibration isolation tables.   The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

Stacking:  A load-stacking test shall be performed once, at the beginning of the contract, for each different unitized or palletized load configuration. A fully palletized load shall be tested utilizing a total stack of three palletized loads, with all the proper bracing and/or reinforcement necessary to perform the test. There shall be no evidence of damage to the pallets, shipping containers or products when stack is tested on the rigid surface for a minimum of 24 hours, in compliance with all the National and Local Safety Regulations. The pre-tested palletized load configuration shall be duplicated using the same packaging materials, pattern, number of shipping (transport) containers, and procedures consistent throughout the duration of the contract. Palletized loads shall be stable and safe when handled with mechanical equipment by qualified personnel.

Materials:  All lumber used inside or outside a shipment shall be bark free. No used wood pallets with repaired components or stringers will be acceptable. All wood pallet stringers shall be manufactured from hardwoods.  Pallets manufactured of materials other than wood, shall conform to all the requirements specified herein.

Unitization:  For the purpose of this requirement, the assembled group of containers or items in a single load that can be handled as a unit throughout the distribution system. Unitization encompasses, but is not limited to, consolidation in a container, placement on a pallet or load base having forklift capability, or securely binding together. Shipments should be considered for unitization where appropriate or specified. 

Unitization of pallet load:  The palletized load shall be unitized and secured to the pallet to insure that the load arrives intact without product damage. The containers or items shall be placed in a suitable pattern to form a stable and balanced load. Vertical, horizontal or filler reinforcement shall be added as necessary to meet the stacking strength requirements. A palletized load shall be secured to the pallet by shrink or stretch wrapping, and/or, by steel or nonmetallic strapping. When steel or nonmetallic strapping is used, edge protectors shall be provided to prevent damage to the cartons when tensioning the strapping. As a minimum, two straps shall run lengthwise, two straps shall run widthwise, and two straps shall run around the girth of the palletized load. A palletized load shall be capable of protecting the products against damage in a multiple handling, transportation, and storage environment having distribution warehouses with rack systems that support the load/s overhead of warehouse personnel.

Notice of special requirements for shipment to all countries that have endorsed the IPPC Guidelines for treatment of non-manufactured wood packaging:  The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) has approved and published on March 15, 2002, “Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International Trade”. Countries endorsing the IPPC Guidelines are found at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/swp/. Clause D-FSS-468 requires non-manufactured wood pallets and other non-manufactured wood packaging material used in shipments destined to IPPC compliant countries require the appropriate wood treatment. Additionally, shipments delivered to DOD distribution facilities or freight consolidation points for eventual delivery to or through EU/IPPC countries shall comply with applicable DLA Regulations and Procurement Letter PROCLTR 02-17.

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF AT LEAST (4) SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) DESIGN-BUILD/100% PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8(A), HUBZONE, OR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN CONTRACTOR. THE OTHER THREE (3) ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  

The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-05-R-0095.  The NAICS Code for this Solicitation is 236220: Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects (new construction and renovations) including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for military installations serviced by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command in the states of Mississippi and Louisiana, and also NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas.  Task Orders may be issued as either Design-Build or 100% Plans and Specifications.  

The work will be at the following primary locations:  NAS Meridian, NCBC Gulfport, NS Pascagoula, Stennis Space Center, Keesler AFB, NAS/NSA New Orleans, Barksdale AFB, and NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The total estimated value for all contracts will not exceed $350,000,000.  The anticipated construction cost of each task order is between $3,000,000 to $15,000,000 with the average project in the $3,000,000 - $10,000,000 range.  Some projects may include significantly developed designs.  If a minimum of two offerors remain in pool during contract duration, this will satisfy the competitive requirements and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the offerors is excluded from participation in the process. The minimum guarantee is $25,000 for each contract.  This procurement will include potential award for one 8(a) eligible, HUBZone eligible or Service Disabled Veteran eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II.  If an 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such.  

The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. 

Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven (7) proposers (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Experience, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor (one) that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8(a), HUBZONE, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  The successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  Otherwise eligible 8(a), HUBZone and Service Disabled Veteran contractors are invited to participate on an unrestricted basis as appropriate.   If the successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.

In Phase II, a maximum of seven (7) Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FOUR CONTRACTS.  THE OFFERORS PROVIDING THE HIGHEST RATED BEST VALUE PROPOSALS WILL BE AWARDED A CONTRACT WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000.  THE HIGHEST RATED OF THOSE WILL BE AWARDED THE SEED PROJECT AS THE FIRST TASK ORDER UNDER THE CONTRACT.
  

All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.  

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation.  

The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 7 March 2005.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.

<DESC>Synopsis The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a U.S. Government corporation, with headquarters in the Washington DC metropolitan area, which provides incentive-based foreign assistance in support of economic growth and poverty reduction.  The MCC requires professional services to provide translations for legal, technical or general documents. The National Business Center (NBC), as the designated representative for MCC, will obtain the required service through Personal Service Contracts (PSC) with highly technically qualified individuals. MCC is engaging with countries that have been selected by MCC's Board of Directors as "eligible countries" for Millennium Challenge Account ("MCA") assistance.  MCC plans to enter into assistance agreements with eligible countries that submit quality proposals for programs that focus on poverty reduction through economic growth.  Professional translation services will be required by NBC to support MCC's review of proposals, due diligence assessments, negotiation of agreements, and oversight of MCC-funded programs with the selected eligible countries. Competent, accurate, and professionally accountable translation of these documents into English (American), and from English into the Host Country's language is required. Background information on MCC can be found at, www.mcc.gov. Interested parties are encouraged to review this information.

<CONTACT>Regina M Clifton, Contract Specialist, Phone (321) 867-8123, Fax (321) 867-2825, Email regina.m.clifton@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for eight PCI Shuttle Databus Interface Cards.  The technical requirements are listed below: 1. Card format shall be PCI. 2. There shall be 2 independent shuttle data bus transmit/receive interfaces per card. 3. There shall be IRIG time synchronization, time tags that provide 1 microsecond resolution for command/data words. 4. Shall Include: c function drivers, with examples and documentation of each function.  All functions shall be compatible with the Borland Turbo C++ Suite compiler. 5. Each interface shall act as a bus controller, remote terminal, or a monitor.  The host pc shall be able to access (read/write) to the data bus card at any time. The monitor shall be able to work in parallel with bus controller or remote terminal mode.	All Manchester error bits shall be available. 6. Bus Controller Mode: The bus controller can be configured to either transmit single messages or scheduled messages. A single message is a transmitted single command word followed by 0 to 512 transmitted command data words, or a transmitted single command word followed by up to 512 response data words.   The host pc program shall define the single message. For scheduled messages, the host pc program shall load the data bus card with a group of messages to be transmitted with variable time (5 microseconds to 100 millisecond) gaps. Messages are as defined above. In single message mode or scheduled message mode, the message can be sent a user defined number of times or cyclically. 7. Remote Terminal Mode: The remote terminal can be configured to capture any command or command data word from the shuttle data bus. It will use a filter consisting of a zero, one or don’t care to test the sync and each bit of each incoming word.	Once a word is captured, the RT may respond with data to transmit, store data received (up to 131,072 command data words per message) or do nothing. The host pc program will set up the criteria.  The RT needs to be able to filter for and respond, up to 16 different words captured from the shuttle data bus.  The filters for the 16 words to be captured are set from the host pc. The host pc program will set the response for each of the 16 words. 8. Monitor Mode: When monitoring, only those received words that pass a software configurable filter will be saved in the monitor buffer. The filter consists of a zero, one, or don’t care for the sync and each bit of a word. When the filter is set for all don’t cares, all received data is saved to the monitor buffer along with other information, including the time tag, sync, error flags, and a bus designator. 9. In all modes, on board memory is used as a buffer to continuously download to the host computer for storage to disk. Captured data would only be limited by space on the disk drive. 10. Documentation shall be provided for card installation into the PC and connection to the Shuttle data bus. The cards are to be delivered FOB Destination to NASA, Kennedy Space Center, Florida. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The solicitation number RFQ-05-4389-01 is issued as a request for quotations and incorporates provisions and clauses that  are in effect through FAC 01-27.  FAR 52.219-6, Notice of  Total Small Business Set-Aside is applicable to this acquisition.  The NAICS code is 221310.  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 4971. The small business size standard is 500 employees.  Item description : GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK: Install and place in satisfactory operating condition one  (1)  561" Linear hose drag center electric drive multi-tower irrigation systems and all required appurtenances in accordance with the plans and specifications of manufacturer, except as noted under exceptions.  Each unit will be a self-contained, electrically propelled land irrigation system driven by individual drive unit structures supported on rubber pneumatic tires.  The basic power train will consist of a three-phase electric motor at each drive tower that will drive the wheels through a series of worm gear reductions.  Each tower ill be electrically controlled to maintain the selected operating speed and correct alignment.   A electric cord will transfer necessary power to propel the system.  GENERAL DESIGN CRITERIA:  All equipment furnished under this section of the specifications will be new and unused, and will be the product of a manufacturer having successful experience in the manufacture of linear irrigation systems.  All equipment provided will be capable of maximum interchangeability of spare parts.  The equipment 	incorporated in this system will be the product of, and furnished by, a manufacturer who is regularly engaged in the production of such equipment for similar applications, and who has an experience record of fifteen (15) years with installations similar to that contemplated in these specifications.  All of the equipment will be the manufacturer's latest and proven design.  All electrical components of the system will operate from a 480-volt, three-phase, 60-Hertz, 4-wire power supply to be provided at installation site.  All controls for the  electrically operated or motor driven equipment will be complete, including all necessary auxiliary relays to operate with an engine-generator set.  All necessary fuses or switches required by the manufacturer for his equipment will be provided with the equipment.  BASIS OF BID: It is the intent of the specifications that all equipment called for under this section of the specification shall be supplied by the linear irrigation system manufacturer.  Erection  the irrigation equipment will be with one or more factory trained personnel.  This will include assembly of the mechanical portion of the linear sprinkler systems, and start-up and adjustment of the equipment.   Responsibility will be concluded when the linear system has been operated continuously for one (1) field cycle (forward and reverse trip).  INSTRUCTION MANUALS:  One (1) copy of the Owner’s Manual will be inserted inside the door of the main control panel along with two copies of the control panel Owner’s Manual.  STRUCTURAL: The four legged cart structure will be erected with 5/16" x 3" x 4" angle.  The diagonal braces will be 1.66" x 12 gauge tube and the horizontal braces will be .125" x 1" x 2" channel.  Dual water inlet ports with check assemblies will be provided to accommodate the attaching and detaching of the water delivery hose.  The main structural water supply pipe will be constructed from 0.105" (12 ga.), 6 5/8" O.D. steel tubing.  Individual pipe assemblies will be connected by inserting molded urethane seals (gaskets) between 8 hole 3/8” thick flanges and using 1/2” plated cap screws and hex lock nuts to secure the pipe sections.  Drive unit weight, including water, will be approximately 7,065 lbs. for the 187' spans.  The pipe support structure of the linear unit will be a bow string, undertruss design.  Vee positioned truss angles will be 3/16" x 2" x 2" and attached to the pipe line and additionally supported with a spreader gusset. Truss rods will be a minimum 3/4" diameter carbon steel and rod will have hot forged head ends.  The pipe will have an external ball and socket flex joint unit, which allows for span to span flexibility, and does not transmit bending or torsion stresses into the pipe.  The pipeline flex hose will be replaceable without disengaging the structural components of the flex joint and without any lifting equipment.  The flex joint will not obstruct the flow inside the pipeline.  The flex hose is attached to ends of the swivel and fixed pipes with plated adjustable clamps.  The flex hose is rated at 150 PSI working pressure.   The drive unit tower will be a four legged structure designed to withstand the forces induced when traversing the field.  The drive unit legs will fabricated from 1/4" x 3" x 3" angle. Two diagonal and six horizontal braces will provide rigidity and strength for the drive unit.  The horizontal base beam at the lower end of the structure will be constructed of 6 5/8" O.D. pipe and will provide a wheel base of 13.3 feet..  All critical structural members, including the pipe, will be hot dip galvanized per ASTM Specification 123 on all surfaces, with the exception of the various small components, including the tower box alignment bar, which will be painted.  The alignment bar will be constructed with a stainless steel threaded rod and stainless nut to ensure positive tower alignment adjustment can be accomplished.  The swivel and fixed pipe of each span will be constructed of one piece tubing to reduce the flange connection when compared to using stub pipes.  No stub pipe assemblies will be used.  Drive unit legs will be attached to the one piece fixed or last pipe assembly to minimize the number of flanged connections on each span.  All cap screws will be Grade 5 minimum.  Locknuts must be used in all structural assemblies.  All fasteners will be commercially zinc plated.  	Tubular tower supports (2.875” x 14 gauge) will be attached between the drive unit legs and the fixed pipe attachment ears.  The tower supports will also be tied into the truss rods with “U”-bolts and a cross channel member.  This provides a unitized support structure to handle tension and compression forces imposed on the drive units as they move across the field.   DRIVE TRAIN:  Centerdrive Gear Motor.  The intermediate drive units will utilize helical gear centerdrive electric motors.  These will be totally enclosed irrigation duty, and capable of operating under extreme environmental conditions.  The centerdrive motors will be 1.2 Hp with a thermal sensitive device to protect the motor against excessive current or heat.  One (1) motor at each drive unit provides input power to the two wheel gearboxes and will operate at and 3600 (2-pole) RPM for high speed operation.  The motors will be rated at 1100 in.-lb. continuos torque and at 7000in.-lb. starting torque.  Nameplate amp draw will be 1.8 (1.2 Hp) for the motors with a 1.3 service factor.  The ribbed aluminum motor housing will be fastened to the gear reducer with external plated stator bolts.  The cart and the last drive unit will utilize worm drive centerdrive electric motors.  These will be totally enclosed irrigation duty, and capable of operating under extreme environmental conditions.  The centerdrive motors will be 1.5 Hp with a thermal sensitive device to protect the motor against excessive current or heat.

The spray nozzles will be attached to hose drop tubes and will discharge water at 7.0 feet above the soil surface.   GUIDANCE: Above ground cable guidance will be used to ‘steer’ the linear machine across the field.  This will be accomplished by utilizing a cable stretched in a straight line approximately 28 inches above the ground and supported every 80 feet by steel posts with 4 inch steel posts at each end.  Arms on the linear cart will support a forward and reverse steering box on each end of the cart.  Wands on the steering box will straddle the cable and sense the relationship of the cart to the cable and provide input to the steering box to guide the linear down the field.    LINEAR CONTROL MODULE:   The essential characteristics include:  Programmable capability for remote execution of commands: Stop position according to time expected at position, Change speeds according to time, Change depth of water applied according to time, 	Start/stop end gun (if installed) according to time,  Stop pump in case of linear malfunction, System shut-down in service road - (end of field stop),   Optional, can be linked to PC via radio telemetry, Sstart/stop auxiliary pump (i.e., chemigation) based on time.   Self diagnostics mode - indicator fault:: System power - low,  System safety - break in system safety circuit, Pressure - loss of water pressure, Command - indicates commanded shut down, Stop in slot - indicates if system is in the stop in slot position.  SOFTWARE: Software will be provided which will provide additional control capabilities.   This should allow programming by distance of up to four different zones along the linear is equipped for automatic control.   Backlit, numerical "key pad" controls and command selection keys to enter constants and programs steps.  Low voltage monitor, surge protection, lightning arrestor, hour meter stop in slot and end gun control are standard features.  Backlit screen to assist in low light conditions.  Control for auxiliary function such as a chemigation pump.
POWER SUPPLY TO THE LINEAR SPRINKLER CART: Three phase 60 Hertz 440/480 AC power will be delivered to the linear cart unit via a four conductor (three power plus ground) 8 gauge, Type W, 600 Volt, 90 degree C Rating cable.  A 30 amp Max-Gard plug will connect one end of the cable to a 30 amp receptacle mounted on the power pedestal and junction box assembly.  The power pedestals and junction boxes will be strategically positioned according to the maximum allowable distance between the junction outlets and within the manufactures recommendation for service in this application. A 30 amp Allen Bradley ground fault sensor will be installed in the main control panel to provide equipment protection.  The cable will be forty feet greater length than the flexible water delivery hose to reduce tangling and interference during operation.  The linear unit will be equipped with end of hose shut down to prevent damage to the flexible water hose and electrical power supply cable as it nears the end of the maximum travel length.  Repositioning will be required unless additional hose and cable are provided as a convenience to the operator.  ELECTRICAL:  The system electrical circuits will operate from a 440/480-volt, three-phase, 4-wire power (with ground) source with a step down 120 VAC transformer for the seven conductor 120-volt, VAC., single-phase control and safety circuits.  
The main power cable from the cart control panel to the tower boxes will be 12 conductor a minimum 12 gauge stranded copper wire.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for a commercial acquisition under FAR Parts 12 and 13. The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to issue a modification to purchase order FA2521-05-P-0051 to extend the period of performance for two months on a sole source basis to Computer Science Innovations, Inc. (CSI), a subsidiary of Essex on behalf of the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), for services to NPP Data Evaluation Support. Services are for maintenance of AFTAC unique automated data storage, retrieval and manipulation tools, as well as management oversight tools. The anticipated period of performance is 1 Mar 05 to 31 Apr 05. This acquisition is justified FAR 13.106-1(b)(l), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Evaluation of the work to be performed indicates that, because of the short period of performance for this service, only one contractor has the requisite experience and required knowledge of AFTAC unique database and support tools, project management, and administrative tasks. No other firm could gain the knowledge required for performance given the proposed length of the contract. This proposed procurement is a 100% small business set-aside. It is advertised with a NAICS code for this acquisition is 541511 and Small Business size standard is $21 M.  The 45th Contracting Squadron has determined that Computer Science Innovations, Inc. (CSI) is the only source capable of providing the necessary services. Sources who feel they are capable of performing this effort should provide evidence of technical capability prior to the closing date of this announcement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Rosalind M. Whitfield, (816)983-3923
<DESC>THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS PREVIOUSLY ADVERTISED AS W912DQ-04-R-0025 AND IS BEING REPLACED IN ITS ENTIRETY WITH THIS SOLICITATION. This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act (PL 92-582) as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, is seeking one qualified offeror to provide Architect-Engineer (A/E) Consultatio n Services in the form of a six member Board of Consultants (Board) in support of the upcoming Tuttle Creek Dam Safety Assurance Program Foundation Modification Contract.  The offeror will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and q ualifications for the required work.  The type of contract proposed for the Board is a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery type contract.  Each offeror shall submit a complete Board.  Offerors without a complete Board will not be considered.  The base con tract will be for three years and will have options to extend the contract for three additional years.  The minimum amount awarded during the base contract period will be $1,200,000.  The total amount of the contract (base plus options) will not exceed $6, 000,000.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under the resulting contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employees off ice location (not the location of the work).   The offeror selected shall have the capability to provide all Board of Consultant disciplines, either directly or by subcontract, in order to provide all consultation services for all phases of the construction contract.  The resultant contract from this s olicitation will be an IDIQ Contract.  Price will be negotiated after the Board has been selected.  Detailed scopes of work will be provided as needed to accomplish work under this contract.  Task orders will be negotiated and executed based on the detaile d scopes of work. The project web site is  http://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/projects/tcdam/index.htm.  The Tuttle Creek Evaluation Report, Environmental Impact Statement, and other project drawings and reports are available on this website.  All other information will be made available to the selected offeror.    Project Information: Tuttle Creek Dam is located on the Big Blue River, in the Kansas River basin, approximately 6 miles north of the City of Manhattan in eastern Kansas.  Tuttle Creek Lake covers approximately 12,500 surface acres at normal pool with over two million acre-fee t of storage below the flood control pool. The dam is a rolled earth fill and hydraulic fill embankment, 7,500 feet in length, standing 137 feet high with a crown width of 50 feet and a base width of 1,050 feet on an alluvial foundation. The dam is located  in a zone of moderate seismicity dominated by the Nemaha Ridge and Humboldt fault zone.    Seismic and geotechnical investigations have established that an earthquake larger than a 5.7 magnitude could cause liquefaction of the foundation sands and potential failure of the embankment. The Maximum Credible Earthquake for consideration at the dam i s a 6.6 magnitude event at approximately 20 kilometers from the dam site. Depending on the magnitude of the earthquake, significant deformation of the entire embankment, and release of the lake is possible.  This would result in devastating flooding effect s to portions of the City of Manhattan.   In order to address the risk of embankment breach during an earthquake, the foundation is to be stabilized using jet grouting and/or deep soil mixing to mix cement into the foundation sands under the upstream and downstream slopes of the dam. This foundati on modification project could potentially involve the treatment of over 400,000 cubic yards of soil.  A cement cutoff wall that extends to bedrock beneath the dam (depths of approximately 200 feet) will also be required to stop normal seepage through the s and b eneath the dam.    Services Required: Types of services required for the six member Board to perform include, but are not limited to:  review, studies, reports, meeting participation, construction site visits on the Tuttle Creek Dam Foundation Modification Project, and all administrative servi ces necessary to support these services.  The Board will be responsible for input on and review of: the full scale field demonstration foundation modification test program proposal, the geotechnical baseline report, contract drawings, specifications, desig n analyses, FLAC deformation modeling, soil parameter modeling, modified ground parameter modeling, and quality control/quality assurance during design.

<DESC>This is a 100% 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement and is open only to construction 8(a) firms with a bona fide Washington State office.  The Government intends for the 8(a) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) vehicle to be awarded as 3 to 5 contracts from a single solicitation.  Resulting 8(a) MACC contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum guarantee for each offeror awarded a contract is $15,000.  The $15,000 minimum guarantee will be deducted from the first Task Order awarded to each contractor.  The contract duration consists of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.  The Not To Exceed (NTE) amount for the life of the overall 8(a) MACC vehicle is $60 Million.  Task Orders will be firm fixed price with an award range between $100,000 and $1,500,000.    
	Task Orders will consist of new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work, including any necessary design.  Task Orders may include the following types of scopes of work: design-build, 100% design, performance-based, or a combination thereof.  Projects will potentially be located at various locations serviced by Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFA NW) including but not limited to Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska, but primarily Washington State.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236; Construction of Buildings. The applicable size standard is $28.5M.  Representative types of projects for NAICS 236 include, but are not limited to: administrative and industrial facilities, housing renovation, childcare centers, lodges, recreation/fitness centers, retail complexes, warehouses, housing offices, community centers, commercial and institutional buildings, manufacturing and industrial buildings and other similar facilities.
Award will be based on a tradeoff (best value) source selection, considering evaluation factors that will be identified in the solicitation.  At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Therefore, each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.         
The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each Task Order award, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505.
    	Competition for this procurement is limited to eligible 8(a) firms located in Washington State and 8(a) participants in good standing serviced by a SBA office outside of Washington State but having a Bona fide branch office in Washington State.  A Bona fide branch office is a place of business for purposes of 8(a) construction procurements located where an 8(a) Participant regularly maintains an office which employs at least one full-time individual within the appropriate geographical boundary.  The term does not include construction trailers or other temporary construction sites.

In addition, clarification is provided to the following requirements: Under Environmental Data Management System Software, Paragraph 1, regarding the statement "Other visual  information tools considered important are RockWorks 2002, LogPlot, and Surfer 8.5." (Note this amendment changed the version of software to version 8 as noted in item no. 5 above. * The Region is requiring the vendor to provide and support the interfaces between the Environmental Data Management  System and the above mentioned software packages or third party equivalents.  A vendor with an internal solution must also provide software interfaces to RockWorks 2002, LogPlot, and Surfer 8 or third party equivalent software packages.  Third party software packages are required because the Region  needs the flexibility to change software as determined necessary due to changes/developments in the software market.

<DESC>GENERAL
The US Department of State (DOS) is seeking interested parties (heretofore identified as “company”) willing and capable of providing daily scheduled shuttle bus/van services over fixed routes, unscheduled group bus/van transportation, cargo and currier transport services and VIP transport via executive sedan, to include provision of all labor and equipment.  The vast majority of services are to be provided Monday through Friday (less Federal Holidays) from approximately 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., primarily in the Washington DC metropolitan area, which includes the District of Columbia and various counties in Maryland and Virginia within 30 miles of the I95/495 Interstate. Specific requirements and exceptions are provided below.

PERSONNEL & ADMINISTRATION
All Company operations personnel are required to possess and maintain a Top Secret Security Clearance and a valid State Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) for the type and class of vehicle to be operated.  Non-driving company supervisory and administrative personnel are not required to maintain a valid CDL, but must maintain a Top Secret Security Clearance.  All company personnel will wear DOS-provided identification cards, which must be visible at all times. 

All Company personnel are required to wear standard, Company-provided uniforms consisting of dress shoes, dress slacks/skirt, dress shirt/blouse, tie/scarf, and suit jacket.  Company personnel must maintain a clean, neat and professional appearance and display a Company identification patch (no larger than 3” by 3”) on one article of outwear at all times.

OPERATIONS
The Company must continuously staff the Dispatch Office from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. to ensure continuity of operations for Company-provided services.  Regular office hours for receiving vehicle reservations and dispatching self-drive, common-use vehicles are 8:15 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  

In addition to performing operational services for DOS personnel throughout the day on an as-scheduled/requested basis, Company personnel will provide:
	-pick up and drop off services of non-Company provided equipment owned or leased by the DOS (for example, pick up of a government vehicle from a leasing company or delivery of a government vehicle to a maintenance facility),
	-dedicated full-time courier services (driver and vehicle) to two offices.  While one of these offices requires service primarily during normal business hours, the other requires service approximately 80-100 hours per week.
	-dedicated full-time driver and vehicle service to two high ranking DOS Officials.  While one of these officials requires service primarily during normal business hours, the other Official requires service approximately 80-100 hours per week. 

The Company is responsible for identifying and obtaining all permits, certificates, etc. necessary to operate Company-provided equipment in support of DOS requirements, and for obtaining and funding all vehicle related permits, inspections, tolls, fees, commercial parking/garaging facilities, traffic tickets, etc.  Company is also required to check all bus passengers for possession of proper DOS identification, and to deny passage to individuals without proper identification or bus pass.  Company will also maintain detailed logs that contain information on destinations, locations, miles traveled, and passengers transported for each trip.

Shuttle service in the DC Metro area consists of eight specific routes, two of which are supported by large 44-passenger buses, with the remaining routes supported by 36-passenger or smaller buses/vans.  Scheduled services run primarily between the Main DOS building located at 21st & C Streets, NW DC and multiple stops in Rosslyn and Arlington, Virginia.  Some routes require a single 15-passenger van, while others require simultaneously running 15-passenger vans, or 24-, 36- or 44-passenger buses.

Unscheduled group bus/van services are required for groups of 15-100 people in the DC Metro area year-round, with some weekend and holiday trips required. Trips range in duration from single, local, partial-day trips to full-day, multiple-stop, multiple-day trips.  Periodic trips out of the DC Metro area are required occasionally.

Cargo pick up and delivery services, including assistance with loading and unloading of cargo, is periodically required by van or straight truck (in excess of 26,000 pound GVW) within the DC area, and to/from Andrews Air Force Base, New York City and other locations outside the DC area.

VIP transport services are provided by executive sedan on a scheduled basis and in accordance with DOS-established priorities.  Pick up and drop off points are generally within the DC area, including National and Dulles Airports, and outlying rural, residential areas. 

In the event of emergent requirements that mandate implementation of evacuation procedures, the Company may be directed to pull vehicles off of established shuttle routes, and to re-direct those vehicles to the evacuation effort; in theses instances the Company will receive directions from the DOS Fleet Manager, his designee or higher authority, and will continue to work unabated as directed until notified by the Fleet Manager to cease emergency operations and resume normal operations. 

The Company is responsible for daily dispatching services, which include supervision of its employees, continuous dispatching of vehicles and equipment to meet scheduled and emergent requirements, computer data entry, reports preparation, billing, vehicle inspections, and trip scheduling and tracking. The Company is also responsible for administering a customer “self-drive” pool of approximately 20-25 general use DOS-provided administrative vehicles, which the Company will dispatch to DOS employees as needed, requested or scheduled, including walk-up requests.  Company oversight of pool vehicles includes verification of DOS employees’ official identification and driver’s license, check-out and check-in vehicle inspections (including documentation), and control of required maintenance servicing and safety inspections.  The Company is also required to perform initial operation safety inspections of pool vehicles prior to dispatch (such as lights, turn signals, horn, and wipers) for proper function, and to ensure that all vehicle fluid levels (oil, fuel, and coolants) are maintained at manufacturer specified levels.  The Company will control pool vehicle keys (including spares) and fuel cards in a secure location, and ensure all keys are marked with the proper vehicle ID number.

EQUIPMENT
The Company will provide all equipment (except pool vehicles) needed to meet DOS operational requirements; the Company will provide all fuel, lubricants, preventive/breakdown maintenance, towing and safety/emissions inspections for its equipment.

<DESC>************  PLEASE NOTE: - This is an amendment to Space Warfare Center (SWC) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 04-01 to extend the period for submission of white papers from 21 Feb 05 to 20 Feb 06.  This amendment also segregates the Focus Areas identified in the BAA by Requiring Activity at the SWC and provides the current Points of Contact (POCs) and Telephone Numbers.  A complete description of SWC BAA 04-02 is identified in the attached document. The SWC may contract for activities covered in the Focus Areas detailed within this BAA. The intent of the BAA is to investigate and develop concepts and technologies that will enable the SWC to meet current and future AF warfighter space needs. The goal is to develop technologies that provide the best possible space capabilities for AF warfighters, when and where needed, in the most cost-effective manner. White papers and subsequent proposals can cover either development of new capabilities or leveraging off existing capabilities.   Please closely follow the directions in the BAA regarding submission of white papers and do not submit a formal proposal at this time.  After market research was performed, it was determined that specific funds would not be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  However, should potential white papers be accepted from those firms, and adequate funding becomes available, proposals will be requested from those institutions.  Direct questions to Mr. Robert Wind at 719-567-3565 or Ms. Brenda Lewis at 719-567-3440.

<DESC>The Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking capability statements from organizations with technical expertise and facilities to support NIAID in achieving its goal of providing product development of medical countermeasures against radiological threats.  DAIT is seeking a contractor to provide a variety of assays to screen for and confirm compound activity, safety pharmacology, and toxicology; use animal models of radiation injury, protection, therapy, or recovery to provide mechanistic, safety, and animal efficacy data to support FDA approval for human use when it is not ethical to perform human efficacy studies; conduct human safety studies; and formulate and manufacture products under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).

This is a new effort; there is no incumbent.  There is an immediate need to move promising medical countermeasures through development and licensure, and into the Strategic National Stockpile, which, currently, includes only a limited number of medications for use following radiation exposure.
 
Few radiation medical countermeasures have been developed to date; therefore, the requirements for investigational new drug application (IND), new drug application (NDA), and/or biologics license application (BLA) submissions and licensure are uncertain and will have to be determined for each product candidate.  Of particular note is that it is unlikely that efficacy testing for these products will be done in humans.  Therefore, the FDA will rely on information generated from animal efficacy studies done in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations to demonstrate efficacy, as described in  21 CFR Pars 314 and 601 “New Drug and Biological Drug Products: Evidence Needed to Demonstrate Effectiveness of New Drugs when Human Efficacy Studies Are Not Ethical or Feasible.”  The final rule is available at:  http://www.fda.gov/cber/rules/humeffic.pdf .  The Contractor will need to maintain awareness of the evolving regulatory requirements for animal research and with the FDA regulatory guideline for animal studies in support of licensure.  Products and compounds submitted for evaluation will include prophylactic agents or radioprotectors that must be given before radiation exposure, radiation mitigators that reduce the potential severity of the injury, and radiation therapeutics that are given after overt symptoms develop.  

The proposed contract will not identify or conduct basic research on new medical countermeasures.  The NIAID anticipates that products selected by the government for screening, testing, and development will come from industry, academia, and government agencies.  This effort will complement these programs by providing the expertise, capabilities, facilities and the full range of product development support services to obtain FDA licensure.
 


This requirement will be awarded as a cost-reimbursement contract with the emphasis being on the contractor’s ability to provide the capabilities and facilities to perform in the below listed major areas.  
NIAID is aware that no single organization or institution may have the expertise and facilities required to perform all requirements set forth in the Statement of Work.   The Offeror must provide information on how they plan to use subcontractors and consultants and the contribution that they will provide.  The NIAID does not know the specific number or types of new drugs that will be available for development.  New drug candidates could be small molecules or biologicals, therefore, the Contractor should have demonstrated expertise and experience in developing drugs for New Drug Applications (NDA) and Biological Licensure Applications (BLA).

The Statement of Work is divided into five (5) major areas:

A.	Development and Performance of Screening and Efficacy Animals Models
B.	Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Support Services
C.	Nonclinical Safety Studies for IND/NDA/BLA Submissions
D.	Clinical Safety and GLP Animal Efficacy Studies for NDA/BLA Submissions
E.	Program Management and Regulatory Support

Offerors will be evaluated on staff and expertise in the above stated areas.

It is anticipated that the period of performance for this contract will be a total of five (5) years.  Interested Small Business organizations should submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above.  See Numbered Note 25.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS CODE 541710, WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.

<SUBJECT>JSLIST GARMENTS (UPDATE)
<DESC>The Joint Program Management Office for Individual Protection  (JPMO-IP) is pursuing an alternate approach for providing chemical and biological (CB) protection to Combat Vehicle Crewmen (CVC) through the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) Additional Source Qualification (JASQ) Unique Candidate Market Survey.  This approach is part of an ongoing Market Survey to identify the capabilities and technologies that are available in the marketplace for meeting the requirements in furtherance of the defense against or recovery from terrorism or nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack (Public Law 107-296, section 858).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement or the original RFI of 17 December 2003, or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.  This Market Survey shall not be construed as a request for proposal.  The Government shall not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages!  for any technical information identified (e.g., limited and/or restricted rights).   This Special Notice is issued by Marine Corps Logistics Command at Albany, GA on behalf of the JPMO-IP.  It serves as public notice regarding the status of the JASQ Unique Candidate Market Survey detailed in the JSLIST JASQ Program Update DON-SNOTE-041220-002 posted to www.FEDBIZOPPS.gov on 20 Dec 2004.  Materials have been received in response to the 07 January 2005 submission date, and the JASQ Unique Candidate Market Survey has entered the Phase II Screening process.  With this Notice, the number of garments required for JASQ Unique Candidate Phase III Full Regime Testing has been reduced from one hundred and eighty (180) garments to one hundred and forty (140) garments.  This Notice also introduces a CVC CB Protective Garment Market Survey that will leverage off of the results of the JASQ Unique Candidate Phase II Screening Tests.  Participants who have provided material that passes the JASQ Unique Candidate Phase II Screening Tests will have three options to proceed: Option 1:  Continued participation in the JASQ Unique Candidate Market Survey alone  -Garments may be submitted in the offeror’s own design  -Garments must be constructed of the same material submitted for screening to the JASQ Unique Candidate Market Survey Option 2:  Participation in the CVC CB Protective Garment Market Survey alone -Garments must be submitted in a design to be provided by the Government  -Garments do not need to be constructed of the same material submitted for screening to the JASQ Unique Candidate Market Survey Option 3:  Participation in both the JASQ Unique Candidate and CVC CB Protective Garment Market Surveys as outlined in Options 1 and 2. Option 1:  The JASQ Unique Candidate Market Survey is an endeavor to identify emerging technologies that satisfy all JSLIST requirements as delineated in the JSLIST Operational Requirements Document (ORD).  Because emerging technologies may not allow garments to be manufactured in the JSLIST design, participants may submit garments manufactured in their own design.  Garments must be manufactured using the same material that was submitted for the JASQ Unique Candidate Phase II Screening Tests.  Data resulting from the JASQ Unique Candidate Market Survey will be used to identify capabilities for the development of future JSLIST improvements.  In addition to the requirements outlined in the 20 Dec 2004 Program Update, participants should include appropriate Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and a Safety Assessment Report (SAR) in accordance with DI-SAFT-80102B with their garment submission.  Participants must clearly state in their submission that they are providing one hundre! d and forty (140) garments for Option 1. Option 2:  The CVC CB Protective Garment Market Survey is an endeavor to identify technologies for a CB protective garment for the CVC community.  The requirements for the CVC CB Protective Garment are delineated in the Joint Protective Aircrew Ensemble (JPACE) ORD, due to the similarity in mission environment between aircraft crewmembers and vehicle crewmen.  Since the JPACE ORD references the JSLIST ORD for CB capabilities, the JSLIST chemical agent Target Performance Values (TPVs) will be used as the baseline for this Market Survey.   The CVC CB Protective Garment Market Survey will leverage off the JASQ Unique Candidate Phase II screening data, so only participants with a material that passes the JASQ Unique Candidate Phase II Screening Tests will be able to submit garments for the CVC CB Protective Garment Market Survey.  Technical challenges to be addressed in this Market Survey are similar to those in the JASQ Unique Candidate Market Survey, and include increased resi! stance to degradation by Petroleum, Oils and Lubricants (POLs), Flame Resistance (FR) at reduced cost, and lighter weight and reduced thermal burden.  Phase III Full Regime Testing will include chemical, durability, and physical properties tests similar to the JASQ Unique Candidate Phase III Full Regime Testing.  Specific tests for the CVC CB Protective Garment Phase III Full Regime Testing will not be identified until a later date.  Participants whose materials pass the JASQ Unique Candidate Phase II Screening Tests and are interested in submitting garments to the CVC CB Protective Garment Market Survey will provide, at no cost to the Government, up to a maximum of two hundred (200) garments for Phase III Full Regime Testing.  Garments must be manufactured to a Government design that will be completed during the third quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2005.   In order to make use of the most technically mature material, participants have the option of constructing their garments of the same material tested during the JASQ Unique Candidate Phase II Screening (Material A), or constructing their garments using an alternative material (Material B).  Garments may only be submitted in one material (either A or B).  Participants must provide sixteen (16) yards of material (36” width) with their garments.  If a material or garment fails field testing, physical properties testing, and/or chemical agent testing at any ! point, that material and garment will be eliminated from further testing.  All testing will be defined and communicated to participants prior to the start of Phase III Full Regime Testing.  Participants will have the opportunity to meet with the Government design team before garment manufacture in order to review the garment design and pattern.  Prior to this meeting, participants must submit to the design team a description of the conceptual design application (i.e. single layer, two separately donned layers, hung liner) of their material together with one yard of the material and one yard of any proposed secondary material. If a secondary material layer is proposed, participants must identify how materials are to be used in a system, and which materials will be in each layer.  Along with this submission, participants must also include MSDS information, a SAR in accordance with DI-SAFT-80102B, and a suggested field expedient repair method.    All submissions to the design team must be sent to NCTRF, Attn: Lauretta Welch/Bldg. 7, Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760. The Government design team will assist participants in manufacturing the garment by conducting a visit to the production site to observe production and inspect garments.  Site visits will be arranged prior to the start of production.  Initially, a minimum of one hundred and forty (140) tariffed garments, sixteen (16) yards of material, and a manufacturing package that contains detailed construction notes and a components list must be submitted no later than 8 weeks after release of the design.  Garments must be submitted in JSLIST packaging.  Participants must clearly state in their submission the number of garments being provided for Option 2 and the material (A or B) used to construct the garments.  Garments and material must be sent to the Test Item Control (TIC) Manager, Battelle, Cathy Campbell, 1425 State Route 142, JS3, West Jefferson, Ohio 43162, 614.424.5086.  Garments will undergo a 480-hour field trial.   The design of the CVC CB Protective Garment will be evaluated after one month of wear.   If design modifications are necessary, participants will again have the opportunity to meet with the Government design team to review modifications.  The Government design team will again assist participants in manufacturing the redesigned garments by conducting site visits.  Participants will then have thirty (30) days from release of the modified design to submit to the TIC up to a maximum of sixty (60) additional tariffed garments.   Option 3:  Participants whose materials pass the JASQ Unique Candidate Phase II Screening Tests may choose to submit garments for both the Unique Candidate Market Survey and the CVC CB Protective Garment Market Survey.  All submission requirements and testing protocols remain the same as those described in Options 1 and 2.  Participants must clearly state in their submission the number of each type of garment being provided for Option 3 and the material (A or B) used to construct the CVC CB Protective Garment.  Oversight of this Market Survey will consist of a panel of Government representatives.  The Government has placed information pertaining to the CVC CB Protective Garment Market Survey on the JASQ Web Page at https://www.quickplace.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/jslist_additional_source_qualification.  Questions regarding the CVC CB Protective Garment Market Survey should be directed in writing to Ms. Heather Shirey, shireyhm@jpmoip.org.  No verbal communication will be accepted.  Participants whose candidates undergo full regime testing will be provided test data upon completion of data analysis.  All materials will be held until completion of testing and disposition of remaining assets will occur after notification of test results.

<SUBJECT>A -- Global Positioning System Control Segment Development Request for Information
<DESC>The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) Joint Program Office (JPO) is considering alternative strategies for acquisition of the next generation GPS space and control segments.  The new acquisition strategy under consideration will compete the next generation space and control segments separately.  The overall systems integration (SI) function may be performed by one of the segments, by a stand-alone SI contract, or by the government.  Under this strategy, the current control segment development will stop after delivery of Architecture Evolution Plan (AEP) Version 5.5 and be shifted to a new development referred to as OCX. OCX will be acquired in an evolutionary fashion that will incrementally deliver capabilities to the field and require growth and flexibility to meet military and civil needs for the next 30 years.  Initially, OCX will focus on early fielding of control segment support for the GPS modernization signals (L2C, L5, and M-code) and the first increment of new space segment development, GPS Block IIIA.  Nominally, the OCX will provide all control segment support for GPS Block IIR, GPS Block IIR-M, GPS Block IIF and GPS Block III, and facilitate the addition of future satellite blocks with new capabilities (new signals, Navwar capabilities, additional payloads).  Alternative OCX acquisition strategies also require investigation.  For instance, early OCX increments could be augmented by AEP to support command and control of the Block II satellites.  SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: The current GPS consists of three major segments. These are: a space segment (SS), a control segment (CS), and a user segment (US).   GPS is a dual use, military and civil system whose primary mission is to provide Position, Navigation and Time (PNT) services.  The Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) is carried as a secondary payload.  Future additional payloads may also include the Distress Alerting Satellite System (DASS) and others.  DASS relays search and rescue data and is planned as a component of the international Cospas-Sarsat search and rescue system. The key capabilities for the future GPS system include high availability of military accuracy in a jammed environment, increased time transfer accuracy, increased position accuracy, higher system integrity, backward compatibility, survivability, L1 signal common with Galileo, and interoperability with the Global Information Grid. CONTROL SEGMENT (CS) DESCRIPTION:  The CS provides command, control, and maintenance services to the space segment and supports both the PNT and the NDS missions. The current operational CS is also known as the "legacy Control Segment" and is composed of a primary Master Control Station (MCS), a Back-Up MCS (BMCS) located at the contractor's facility, six dedicated Monitor Stations and five dedicated Ground Antennas that are located at remote sites. The CS that is currently in development consists of the following elements: an AEP-based Operational Control Segment (OCS), a Launch Early Orbit Anomaly and Disposal Operations (LADO) capability, a GPS System Simulator (GSS), an AEP-based Alternate Master Control Station (AMCS) and an Integrated Mission Operations Support Center (IMOSC). AEP versions 5.2/5.5 are currently under development and expected to go operational in CY06/08.  LADO is expected to go operational in CY06. The OCX may be divided into subsystems supporting the following functions: Telemetry, Tracking, and Commanding (TT&C) that is common to all space vehicles (SVs), SV-specific TT&C, mission planning, and the navigation mission.  The OCX will be expected to support Navigation Warfare (Navwar) Mission Planning and to have connectivity with a classified facility from which Navwar, Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) and other sensitive capabilities can be planned and executed.  OCX capabilities may be incrementally fielded, but the OCX must evolve to support full GPS III capability.  Notionally, the first OCX increment should:  1) expand monitoring from P(Y) only to all navigation signals; 2) provide for generation of the modernized navigation messages; 3) account for aviation safety certification requirements; 4) provide TT&C support for GPS IIIA; and 5) provide a level of automation for mission planning. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: The purpose of this announcement is to assist the government in identifying interested potential offerors or teams capable of achieving the OCX program objectives with acceptable risks and costs.  This announcement also seeks feedback on: 1) how best to develop and deliver the OCX  control segment capability; 2) whether to split the OCX functions (TT&C, Navigation Mission, Mission Planning) into several separate acquisitions; 3) alternative operations and maintenance concepts using different mixes of government and contractor employees; and 4) how to best address system integration responsibilities. Interested and potential offerors are requested to submit a response package that provides the following information: 1) experience and summary of capabilities in developing space segments and control segments including specific experience with certifications (system security/information assurance, net ready/interoperability, and aviation safety); 2) experience as a system integrator; 3) input on how to allocate the roles and responsibilities between potential space and control segment contractors; 4) input on how the system integrator's roles and responsibilities should be defined; 5) input on the advantages and disadvantages associated with further splitting and executing of the control segment functions (TT&C, Navigation Mission, and Mission Planning) under separate contracts and suggestions for how to split it; 6) interest in proposing on any or all of the control, or system integrator responsibilities if submitted under separate solicitations (to include the level of expertise the company would provide for each responsibility); 7) recommendation for the most effective (cost, schedule, performance, risk) transition path from the AEP control segment to full OCX capability; and 8) an estimated schedule to incrementally develop and deliver the OCX capabilities, in Gantt-chart format (timelines should be independent of program start date and reflect contractor’s past ground segment development experiences -- reference programs and complexity). The Government requests responses by 11 March 2005 to support ongoing acquisition planning. Responses should be submitted via email in electronic form in MS Word 2000 or newer format or PDF format to carol.laechelt@losangeles.af.mil with a follow-up signature hard copy of the submission to SMC/GPK, Attn: Carol Laechelt, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1866, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659.

<SUBJECT>A -- Global Positioning System Block III Space Segment Development Request for Information
<DESC>The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) Joint Program Office (JPO) is considering alternative strategies for the acquisition of the next generation of the GPS space and control segments.  The new acquisition strategy under consideration will compete the next generation space and control segments separately.  The overall systems integration (SI) function may be performed by one of the segments, by a stand-alone SI contract, or by the government.  Under this strategy, the space segment development, or GPS Block III, is an evolutionary acquisition program requiring growth and flexibility that will focus on incrementally delivering the full GPS Block III capability and early fielding of the first increment of GPS Block III, referred to as GPS Block IIIA.  Current GPS III program baseline is for first launch in FY 13.  We would like to explore options to launch GPS Block IIIA as early as our current projections for the launch date of GPS Block IIF–13, currently estimated to be required in FY11. The GPS Block III space segment acquisition will include developing a new satellite bus to allow for growth and flexibility to support full GPS III capability.   In addition to the modernized Block II capabilities, the GPS III space vehicle (SV) will ultimately have an additional L1 civil signal, a directional M-Code signal (nominally +20 dB), on-orbit payload reprogrammability, on-board signal integrity monitoring, and crosslinks to support inter-satellite ranging and TT&C.  The GPS III Draft System Specification describes the required Block III capabilities and can be found in the GPS III bidder's library.  SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:  The current GPS consists of three major segments. These are: a space segment (SS), a control segment (CS), and a user segment (US).  GPS is a dual use, military and civil system whose primary mission is to provide Position, Navigation and Time (PNT) services.  The Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) is carried as a secondary payload.  Future additional payloads may also include the Distress Alerting Satellite System (DASS) and others.  DASS relays search and rescue data and is planned as a component of the international Cospas-Sarsat search and rescue system.  The key capabilities for the future GPS system include high availability of military accuracy in a jammed environment, increased time transfer accuracy, increased position accuracy, higher system integrity, backward compatibility, survivability, L1 signal common with Galileo, and interoperability with the Global Information Grid.  SPACE SEGMENT DESCRIPTION: 
The SS consists of SVs in a constellation designed to maximize availability of precise position and time, with additional on orbit active spares, and associated Ground Support Equipment (GSE) to store and process a vehicle for launch at the launch site.  GPS satellites provide ranging signals that enable GPS users equipped with properly designed GPS receivers, to precisely determine time and their three-dimensional position and velocity.  The GPS constellation is currently comprised of Block II, Block IIA, and Block IIR SVs which broadcast the L1 C/A, L1 P(Y), and L2 P(Y) navigation signals.  The NDS payload is also hosted on these satellite vehicles. The modernized Block II satellites, IIR-M and IIF, add a military-only signal (M-Code) on L1 and L2 and new dedicated civil signals, L2C and L5 (IIF only), to the existing legacy signals.  The first IIR-M will be launched in CY05; the first IIF will be launched in CY07.  The NDS payload is also hosted on these satellite vehicles. The GPS Block IIIA space segment acquisition will include a satellite bus that allows for growth and flexibility to support incremental progress towards full GPS III capability.   Notionally, the initial increment will add a new L1 civil signal common with Galileo, increased earth coverage M-Code signal power (nominally +10dB) or directional M-Code signal (nominally +20 dB), and Ka or V-band crosslinks for inter-satellite ranging and TT&C.  The NDS payload interface will remain nearly unchanged; however, the NDS mission may require migration of the downlink off L3 to a suitable frequency.  Alternative initial configurations that accelerate incremental fielding of capability or significantly reduce program risk also require investigation.  For example, DASS could be a candidate for implementation on the first increment, or crosslink ranging capabilities could be deferred to a later increment.  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  The purpose of this announcement is to assist the government in identifying interested and potential offerors or teams capable of achieving these space segment program objectives with acceptable risks and costs.  This announcement also seeks feedback on: 1) the viability of the notional GPS Block IIIA concept; 2) how to best develop and deliver early satellites as quickly as possible with increasing capability from increment to increment; 3) how accelerating/delaying implementation of capabilities in GPS IIIA affects timelines for development and delivery of the first SV; 4) how the government can best incentivize schedule for early launch of GPS IIIA; and 5) how to best address system integration responsibilities. Interested and potential offerors are requested to submit a response package that provides the following information: 1) experience and summary of capabilities in developing space segments and control segments including specific experience with certifications (system security/information assurance, net ready/interoperability, and aviation safety); 2) experience acting as a system integrator; 3) input on how to allocate the roles and responsibilities between potential space and control segment contractors; 4) input on how the system integrator's roles and responsibilities should be defined; 5) interest in proposing on any or all of the space, or system integrator responsibilities if submitted under separate solicitations (to include the level of expertise the company would provide for each responsibility); 6) recommendation for the most effective (cost, schedule, performance, risk) incremental development path to full GPS III capability; and 7) an estimated schedule to incrementally develop and deliver the GPS III capabilities, in Gantt-chart format (timelines should be independent of program start date and reflect contractor’s past space segment development experiences -- reference programs and complexity).  The Government requests responses by 11 March 2005 to support ongoing acquisition planning.  Responses should be submitted via email in electronic form in MS Word 2000 or newer format or PDF format to carol.laechelt@losangeles.af.mil with a follow-up signature hard copy of the submission to SMC/GPK, Attn: Carol Laechelt, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1866, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659.

<SUBJECT>Small Caliber Ammunition status
<DESC>The following announcement provides an update to the current status of the Army’s Small Caliber Green Ammunition Program and a synopsis of plans for follow-on efforts. This notice is to inform interested small caliber ammunition producers on the status of the Army’s Small Caliber Green Ammunition program.  The initiative consists of a two phase evaluation of commercial 5.56mm green ammo alternatives.  The intent is to select an optimum green 5.56mm cartridge that meets performance requirements and is affordable. The Army and Alliant Techsystems (ATK) have completed the Green Ammunition Phase I evaluation. The evaluation was highly successful in terms of the following:   Establishing the root causes of the field failures (tumbling – excessive yaw)   Development of manufacturing process changes to eliminate/reduce these occurrences   Identification of several potential alternative candidate materials with properties more closely associated with those of lead that could be substituted without a major redesign effort. In Phase I, system cost was identified as a major shortcoming. Currently 5.56mm Green ammunition alternatives were in excess of standard lead based ammunition.  With the tremendous growth in ammunition requirements on the order of 400 percent on average, it became necessary to examine the affordability of the current design. With the advent of the cost premium and significant requirements growth the Project Manager – Maneuver Ammunition Systems decided to re-direct the program to investigate a total cartridge solution.  This will allow for a full range of design solutions to be considered.  The original program goals were limited to providing a solution that would be as identical to the M855 5.56mm service round as possible with green materials.  This limited the alternatives offered by industry.  The Program Manager is now seeking a best value solution that lessens environmental impact while being cost effective and performs at least as well or better than the current M855 cartridge. This will be the main objective in Phase II. This investigation will be headed jointly by the Army and Alliant Techsystems which operates Lake City Army Ammunition Plant for the Army. All efforts will be closely tied to ATK/Lake City Army Ammunition Plant to ensure high rate sustained producibility. The Government and ATK are in the detailed program planning effort for Phase II of the Small Caliber Green Ammunition Program.  The Government will host an industry day tentatively planned for April 7, 2005 in the Picatinny Arsenal geographic area.  Letters detailing the Phase I results will be sent to the participants detailing how their material performed. At the industry conference the Government and ATK will provide:   A review of the Phase I efforts and provide time for individual feedback to participants of their Phase I submittal.   An overview of the program plan for Phase II of Small Caliber Green Ammunition Program and how industry can participate. Further Information regarding the Industry Day Conference and this program will be posted at http://procnet.pica.army.mil.

HSAR 3052.209–70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this procurement is RFP-CAZ-05-023.  This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The solicitation document, consequent award, and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 01-27.  This acquisition is set aside for small business concerns.  The associated NAICS code under this solicitation is 541360 and the size standard is $4 million.  The deliverables for this solicitation include (1) EV Sequence Table I, III; (2) BPS Sequence Table I; (3) Field Keys II, IV, V; (4) Rapid Assessment Report, Great Lakes; (5) Rapid Assessment Report, South Central; (6) Rapid Assessment Report, Southeast; (7) EV Sequence Table VI; (8) BPS Sequence Table VI; (9) Rapid Assessment Report, Northeast; (10) West EDC Map Zone Attribution; (11) EV Sequence Table IV; (12) EV Sequence Table VII; (13) Draft National Legend; (14) Field Keys I, II, VI; (15) Rapid Assessment Report, North Plains; (16) Rapid Assessment Report, Southern Appalachians; (17) Map Legend Workshop, Northern Rockies/Northwest Plains; (18) EV Sequence Table VIII; (19) Map Legend Workshop, Sacrament; (20) Field Key X; (21) Field Key VII, VIII; (22) Field Key IX; (23) EV Sequence Table II, V; (24) EV Sequence Table X; (25) Map Legend Workshop, Portland; (26) EV Sequence Table XI; (27) Field Key XI; (28) EV Sequence Table IX; and (29) Access Database.  This procurement includes a national effort aimed at producing a series of nationally consistent (‘mid-scale’) maps that depict existing vegetation and biophysical settings, and the degree to which current fire/fuels conditions have departed from expected ‘natural’ ranges of variation.  These ‘mid-scale’ maps (both spatial and thematically) are intended to integrate well with more detailed mapped data produced locally (e.g. a national forest level).  The primary aim of the vendor’s work will be to update and document current knowledge in support of mapping existing vegetation and terrestrial biophysical settings.  These maps, produced at 30m-pixel resolution, will be used to provide robust depictions of fire condition class.  Mapping of fire condition class will utilize conceptual state-transition models for each ecological classification unit that qualitatively describes biophysical settings, natural vegetation types, and characteristic successional pathways.  These conceptual models enable mapped comparisons of current vegetation with biophysical setting to determine the degree of departure in current conditions from expected conditions.  The contribution to LANDFIRE will take several principle forms:  (1)  Coordinate with LANDFIRE staff to organize a series of meetings with major map producers and users throughout the United States in effort to form a National Mapping Consortium to collaborate and share costs associated with producing LANDFIRE map products.  (2)  Coordinate ongoing development, description, and diagnostic keys for the map legend of existing vegetation.  This includes approximately 350-400 upland and wetland ecological system types that will describe natural/semi-natural vegetation across the coterminous United States.  Both field keys and plot data sequencing tables shall be developed to support efficient and accurate attribution of field plot data to the map legend.  (3)  Collaborate with LANDFIRE staff to prototype development of diagnostic keys to terrestrial biophysical settings.  (4)  Consult and document methods used throughout 2005 portion of this national effort.  Delivery of the final product shall be Rocky Mountain Research Station, Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory, 800 East Beckwith Avenue, Missoula, Montana, 59801.  Delivery shall be made on or before April 30, 2006.

<DESC>3.12	TERMS OF REFERENCE (1-5 Pages)

The DM Contractor shall provide Terms of Reference (TOR) for the study(ies).  The TOR, which must be endorsed by the project sponsor, shall include, at a minimum, the following:

3.12.1	Purpose and objective of the study.  This section should contain a concise statement.

3.12.2	 A technical assessment. This section should include relevant background information that is pertinent to the technology selection.

3.12.3	An economic analysis of the project. This section will usually include a cash flow analysis, attention to market conditions, raw material availability, supply agreements, off-take agreements, and competing alternative methods of achieving the same or similar project objectives.

3.12.4	A financial analysis of the project. This section should consider the availability of equity and debt financing as well as the views of potential public and private financing organizations, such as the World Bank, relevant regional multilateral development bank(s), Ex-Im and OPIC.

3.12.5	An appropriate environmental analysis of the project. A preliminary review of the project’s anticipated impact on the environment with reference to local requirements and those of multilateral lending agencies (such as the World Bank).  This review would identify potential negative impacts, discuss the extent to which they can be mitigated, and develop plans for a full environmental impact assessment if and when the project moves forward to the implementation stage.  This includes the identification of steps that will need to be undertaken by the project sponsor subsequent to the study’s completion and prior to project implementation. 

3.12.6	A review of regulatory issues related to the project.  This should include a discussion of any regulations that would impact the projects viability or prognosis to move forward.

3.12.7 An analysis of key host country development impacts. (Infrastructure, Human Capacity Building, Technology Transfer and Productivity Improvement and/or Market-Oriented Reform).  These Development Impact factors are intended to provide the project’s decision-makers and interested parties with a broader view of the project’s potential effects on the Host Country. 

The analysis shall focus on what Development Impact is likely if the project is implemented according to the study recommendations.  While specific focus shall be paid to the immediate impact of the project, analysis shall include any additional developmental benefits that may result from the project’s implementation, including spin-off and demonstration effects.

Accordingly, the analysis shall be an assessment of each of the following categories with respect to the project’s potential Development Impact:

(1)  Infrastructure:  Provide a statement on the infrastructure impact, giving a brief synopsis.  For example, “The project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve ___ [number] additional households in ____ [area].”

(2)  Market- Oriented Reform:  Provide a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented.

(3)  Human Capacity Building:  Assess the number and type of local positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project, as well as the number of local people who would receive training; describe such potential training program.

 (4)  Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement:  Provide a description of any advanced technologies that would be utilized as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that would be gained (e.g. “By upgrading the power plant’s old boilers, efficiency will be increased from x% to y%”).

(5)  Other:  Describe any other developmental impacts or benefits that would result from the project, for example, follow-on or replication projects, safer workplace, increased good governance or improved financial revenue flows to the Host Country.

For specific information regarding USTDA’s Development Impact goals and measures, please contact the COTR at USTDA, or see the Guidance on USTDA Development Impact Measures at www.ustda.gov/resources.

 3.12.8	U.S. sources of supply.  While aiming at optimum specifications and characteristics for the project, there shall be an assessment of the availability of potential U.S. sources of supply.  Business name, point of contact, address, telephone, e-mail, and fax numbers shall be included for each source.

6 	PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

India is one of Asia’s largest economies as well as one of the fastest growing.  India’s aviation sector is expected to expand nearly 9% per year for the next two decades.  The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is the state-owned umbrella body that operates the country’s 125 airports.  Mumbai and New Delhi are their biggest airports, and they are generally recognized to be operating below global standards.  In mid-2004, the Indian Government announced plans to complete the sale of these two major airports by March 2005.  Privatization of these two profitable airports is currently in the midst of bidding, where both local and international conglomerates are preparing proposals for the Ministry of Civil Aviation.  According to the Ministry, the modernization of the two airports includes upgrades, the building of a new international terminal in New Delhi, and a domestic terminal in Mumbai, with an estimated cost of more than $777 million.  

In addition to these major airports, the Ministry has issued plans to allow the Airports Authority of India to raise $1.1 billion in tranches, to fund the modernization of about 30 airports by 2007-2008.  Modernization includes basic infrastructure, information systems, communications linkages, services upgrades and airport security.  In December 2004, India’s Cabinet also approved a plan to build a new international airport in the southern city of Hyderabad, worth an estimated $313 million.  

India is experiencing strong economic growth, which is greatly impacting its current and projected air traffic management and aviation infrastructure needs.  The Government of India (GOI) is working to increase funding and attract private investment in order to upgrade its airport infrastructure and improve airport security.  In January 2005, the United States and India announced an Open Skies Agreement, which will enhance aviation cooperation between the two countries and is expected to lead to opportunities related to both commercial and cargo air operations.  This is the first Open Skies Agreement for India.
	
USTDA has had an active program in this sector in India.  A satellite navigation project is expected to move ahead shortly with a large contract for U.S. technology and services.  Other earlier studies and training related to air traffic management, as well as Civil Aviation and Aviation Security OVs, have demonstrated that Airports Authority of India (AAI) and other GOI agencies in this sector are credible partners that are open to U.S. technologies and expertise.  

Based on the growth in India, economically, and in the sector of aviation, USTDA wishes to hire a Contractor to recommend potential projects for USTDA funding in the areas of airports construction and modernization, airport security, air traffic control, and other aviation related areas.  The recommendation will be based upon sector developments, government initiatives and priorities, and previous USTDA work.

3.13		STUDY BUDGET  (2-3 PAGES)

	3.13.1		Study Budget Format 
	The DM Contractor shall provide a detailed budget that is divided into three parts: a line item budget and task breakdown (Annex III), a Task Completion Schedule (Annex IV), and a budget narrative (Annex V).  All costs in the budget should be reasonable and allocable to the work being performed, and should support the study TOR.  The budget should be supported with sufficient detail to enable USTDA staff or others reviewing the material to understand completely, not only the budgeted amounts, but also the methodology that justifies the budget amounts. The budget should be provided in accordance with the format in Annex III and should include:
·	Labor, budgeted by position title and task for each of the positions on the study team. Positions should be identifiable, with descriptions of the positions and proposed team members included in the proposal. Person-Days should reflect the proposed number of days of work effort proposed for each position for each task. The labor cost shall be derived as set forth in Annex III.  The proposed budget may not include fee or profit.
·	Itemization for per diem, transportation, communications, purchased services/contracts, translation of Final Report, and other direct costs. Per diem must be based on U.S. Government rates, which are available on the State Department web site (http://www.state.gov/m/a/als/prdm/). 

The Task Completion Schedule should list each major task to be performed in support of the study TOR.  The duration of each task is to be graphically presented in a bar chart as illustrated in Annex IV.

The budget narrative should provide a detailed budget explanation and justification presenting how all costs have been derived in accordance with the sample provided in Annex V.  The narrative must include an explanation for every line item.  In general, each narrative statement should describe, in as much detail as possible:

·	What the specific item is
·	How the specific item relates to the project
·	How the amount shown in the budget was arithmetically determined

3.14		RECOMMENDATIONS (1-2 PAGES)

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The MOF is a Vietnamese government agency that manages the state’s budget, including the collection of taxes, fees and other revenues.  Its primary responsibilities include managing national reserves, state-owned assets, corporate finances, and state-owned capital at public enterprises.  The MOF supervises Vietnamese government borrowings and debt servicing from within Vietnam and abroad, international grants, management of accounting and auditing procedures, regulation of banks and non-banking financial institutions, provision of financial services, and customs activities.

USTDA has worked with the MOF on the development of a World Bank-funded Treasury and Budget Management Information Systems (TABMIS) project by providing assistance through a feasibility study (USTDA No. 1997-351B) and Orientation Visit (USTDA No. 2004-30002A).  This $45 million project has reached its final procurement phase, and U.S. firms are prominently included in each of the short-listed consortiums.  We have also provided assistance to the VST (under the MOF) for the development of an agency-wide information and communications technology network; this study is nearing completion (USTDA No. 2001-30076B).

There are five specific development projects that the MOF would like for USTDA to consider.  The first project would build on the work done to date for VST by defining the organization's "Enterprise Architecture."  In particular, the MOF is asking for USTDA to support an activity that would provide a detailed design of VST's architectures for information flow, application processing, data management, and ICT.  This assistance would also identify the institutional and infrastructure upgrades that would need to occur given the imminent implementation of the TABMIS.  

The second project proposal involves the development of a Financial Statistics System.  The MOF is seeking to construct a modern system that will allow it to generate accurate statistical information for making assessments, forecasts, and fiscal plans.  The Vietnamese government's ultimate goal is to have in place by 2010 a complete financial statistics system that follows international standards for Government Financial Statistics (GFS).

The third project would assist the MOF's GDT with its strategic planning and modernization program.  The GDT is seeking assistance to assess the information technology and organizational requirements that will allow the department to ensure more effective and efficient revenue operations.

The fourth project would be for technical assistance to establish a Credit Guarantee Fund within the MOF.  

There is a fifth potential project that the DM Contractor shall investigate.  The State Securities Commission (SSC), also under the MOF, has been working with the U.S. Agency for International Development on the development of its stock market.  During the course of this assistance, the SSC sought U.S. Government technical assistance to develop a regulated over the counter (OTC) trading market for unlisted securities. 


 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.
