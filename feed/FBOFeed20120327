<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) under the Federal Funded Research and Development Centers policies in support of the Air Force Weather Agency.
<p>This notice is for informational purposes only, Numbered Note 22 applies. This is neither a request for proposal nor solicitation of offers. A determination by the government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received by close of business (15 days) will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.</p>
<p>The UCAR, through their stewardship of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), is the "Community Coordinator" for the creation, development, and sustainment of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. UCAR is the sole developer of the software architecture framework to this model, which enables its community open design, as well as the sole developer of the Advanced Research WRF dynamical core to this model, which is foundational to Air Force Weather's terrestrial numerical weather prediction capability. UCAR performed this role for the WRF prototype since the late 1990's and after the release of version 1.0 in 2000. UCAR scientists received funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to perform research and developmental type work on WRF since 1997.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the initial community release, UCAR provided continuous software architecture framework RDT&amp;E to sustain an ever growing community user base, as well as, model dynamics and physics improvements of their own. In their role to ensure scientific veracity and utility to community contributions to the WRF model, UCAR ensured baseline model quality and standards through configuration management for all subsequent. UCAR provides coding standard guidelines for all contributors to follow, and provides regression testing prior to an annual release in April.</p>
<p>The WRF model is the core numerical weather prediction model in support of Air Force Weather's Specialized Models, AFW's aerosol and dust forecasting capability, as well as its electro-optics and point analysis intelligence system. Additionally, WRF also is a driver to the land surface model used throughout the DoD and the statistical cloud forecasting capability provided to the intelligence community.</p>
<p>Under this contract, UCAR will provide services to establish and maintain WRF reference configurations; maintain, upgrade, and enhance the capabilities of the Model Evaluation Tools (MET) and provide support to the community for improved verification capabilities; and data assimilation system support and testing. This effort will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF), Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a five year ordering period.</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR BOMBARDIER LEARJET AND CHALLENGER AIRCRAFT
This is a market survey for timely support of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Learjet and Challenger Flight Inspection (FI) Aircraft.  Bombardier Aerospace Corporation is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), of twelve (12) FAA FI jet aircraft which includes six (6) Learjet 60, three (3) Challenger 601, one (1) Challenger 604, and two (2) Challenger 605 models.  These aircraft require a wide range of supply and technical support and services that must be provided in a timely manner.  Supply, technical support and services in support of the FAA's Learjet and Challenger aircraft includes parts, rental services, repair services, overhaul services, calibration services, engineering support services, pilot services, and technical publications.  Supply and technical support and services are necessary to maintain FAA Learjet and Challenger aircraft in airworthy, safe, and reliable condition which allows the aircraft to be readily available to perform critical FI missions.  Requirements are identified in the attached draft statement of work which was prepared by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Aircraft Maintenance and Engineering Group (AMEG).  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors' expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
Market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing the supply, technical support and services necessary to maintain FAA Learjet and Challenger aircraft.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code anticipated for this effort is 488190, Other Support Activities for Air Transportation, with a size standard of $5.0 Million.   
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and provide a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify in 20 pages or less:a) Type of services provided by your firm with particular attention to SOW paragraph 3.0 entitled "Supplier Responsibility". b) Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance), c) Number of years in business
2.  Identify the geographical areas where your company can provide services. 
3.  Identify if your company has published pricing or online pricing available for supply and technical support and services for Learjet 60 and Challenger 601, 604, 605 aircraft models.   Identify an estimated number of supply items listed in your company published or online catalog that support Learjet 60 and Challenger 601, 604, 605 aircraft models.
4.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.  
Attached is a DRAFT of the Statement of Work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the Statement of Work and provide comments.  If you are viewing this announcement through Fed Biz Ops (www.fbo.gov) the attachments may not be available/viewable to you.  If so, please proceed to the FAA's Contract Opportunities Website at faaco.faa.gov to obtain the attachments.  
All responses to this market survey must be received by 9 April, 2012, 3:00 P.M. CST.  Submittals can be by email, fax, or hard copy.  The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following:

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (U.S.F.W.S.) has a requirement for aerial application via helicopter of herbicides to control and eradicate target species Phragmites australis in the footprint of the Lateral West Wildfire, which burned 6,377 acres at the Great Dismal Swamp NWR in August, 2011.
The work under this contract consists of furnishing all necessary equipment, labor and materials necessary to accomplish the specified mapping, vegetative control and eradication. Contractor shall furnish necessary herbicide and surfactant. Initially, the contractor will need to perform an early season reconnaissance flight to include GPS mapping, in which U.S.F.W.S. personnel will accompany the pilot to assist in the identification of specific areas to be sprayed within the 1,395 acre contaminated area of the wildfire. The herbicide applications will consist of two separate spray missions: 1) flight following the reconnaissance/mapping flight to apply a combination of glyphosate and imazapyr products to all phragmites australis populations identified for treatment; and 2) a late season survey and clean up spray to apply imazapyr product to surviving clones of Phragmites.
Insurance:  The contractor will carry liability insurance that will cover the application of pesticides as defined in the specifications. This coverage will include as a minimum, drift, run-off, and pollution (sudden and accidental) for all contract operations. The amount of coverage this insurance will provide will not be less than $1,000,000. per incident.
The estimated magnitude of this project is between $100,000. and $250,000. This acquisition shall be competed as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 115112. The small business size standard is $7 million. 
The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued on or about April 3, 2012. The solicitation will only be available electronically at www.fbo.gov. Proposals will be due on May 4, 2012 by 4:00 pm (EST). A Firm Fixed Price Contract is anticipated.
Interested contractors must be registered at the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) website at www.ccr.gov, and complete Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) at www.bpn.gov, to be eligible for award. Also, any payment requests under the awarded contract for this project must be submitted electronically through the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Internet Payment Platform System (IPP).

<DESC>Description: The intent of this solicitation is to provide services, equipment, and labor necessary for maintaining or restoring animal populations that need meadow habitat on the Central Coast Ranger District - Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. The primary focus of treatments is controlling unwanted vegetation in or adjacent to meadows. Unwanted vegetation includes but is not limited to non-native grasses, fern, blackberry, shrubs, and small trees. Portions of some meadows are steep and will require good traction to complete treatments. Treatment methods vary depending on type of vegetation to be removed and the ability to access sites with machinery. Treatment methods can include machine mowing, machine mulching, and hand work. Machine mowing is generally used where machinery has access and the unwanted vegetation can be treated with a mower (grass and small shrubs, blackberry, trees, etc.). Mulching is used where machinery has access and unwanted vegetation is too large for mowing. Hand work with chainsaws, weed-eaters, etc. is used where machinery cannot access areas that need treatment. The amount of effort needed to control unwanted vegetation varies by site. For this solicitation the Government expects 326 acres of tractor mowing, 27 acres of mowing with tracks required on equipment, and 28 acres of hand work.
<p>Solicitation will be available for download from FedBizOpps website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about April 11, 2012. Estimated start work date is May 21, 2012.</p>
<p>Note: prospective awardee shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) data base prior to award. Information on registration may be obtained via the internet at: http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.

<DESC>This work is located at Bonneville Lock and Dam, Washington Shore Fish Ladder.  Contractor access to the work site will be primarily from SR-14 on the Washington side of the Columbia River.<br><br>This work is for improvements to the entrance (downstream end) of the Washington shore fish ladder.  The improvements are to address existing lamprey fish passage delays.  Work elements include water management, dive work, concrete cutting and boring, steel fabrication, fabrication and installation of gravity water supply system, fabrication and underwater installation of Lamprey Flume System, maintaining the fish ladder in a dewatered state, Government Furnished Property relocation, Government Furnish Property installation, crane support for research operations, and additional work as indicated in the Specifications and Drawings.<br><br>Construction methods will include dive work, dewatering, concrete demolition, concrete construction, steel erection, mechanical installation, and electrical installation.<br><br>The construction work will be required to interface with on-going operations, other construction contractors, in-water work seasons, existing avian wire array downstream of the dam, and spillway operations for fish passage.<br><br>The improvements consist primarily of a gravity water supply system which feeds water to a Lamprey Flume System (LFS).  The gravity water supply pulls excess screened water from the Down Stream Migratory (DSM) dewatering system which is capable of providing 52.5 cfs (70 cfs maximum) to the Lamprey Flume System.<br><br>The gravity supply system begins with a collection trough located after the overflow weirs which control the dewatering of the DMS.  The collection trough is roughly 33.5 feet in length and spans across all or part of weirs 12 thru 16. A slide gate in the trough provides closure to the top to the gravity water supply pipe.  A 36 inch pipe, roughly 375 feet long, will convey the water out of the DSM structure, down the hill and under the road and through the upper part of the fish ladder to connect to the water supply header.  The water supply header is a manifold of smaller pipe branches that feed the diffusers of the Lamprey Flume System.  The LFS is submerged in the tailrace and attached to the south wall of the fish ladder.  The LFS is roughly 130 feet in length and branches into two picketed entrances.  4 Pit Tag Detectors will be integrally installed as components of the LFS.<br><br>Located near the entrance to the fish ladder, in the Lamprey Flume System (LFS) Valve Room, a PLC will control a butterfly valve to maintain the flow in the Lamprey Flume System at an adjustable set point.<br><br>Magnitude of Construction is $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.  A formal solicitation including complete plans and specifications will be available on or about 24 April 2012. <br>

Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required service  2.) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.  3.)

The Government intends to establish a new contract to convert from 1 to 6 Minuteman III MK 12A Mod 3 configured re-entry vehicles to the Mod 5F configuration.
<p>The Air Force is in the process of preparing a Justification and Approval document to gain the required approval to issue a sole source request for proposal to Textron Defense Systems.</p>
<p>Statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for Textron to cut two new antenna windows in the Mod 3 midsection, fabricate new antenna assemblies ( housings, S and C band iris, fused quartz window, and antennae), procure and install Radio Frequency (RF) cables , power splitters and show that the newly configured Mod 5F midsection meets RF requirements. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1: only one responsible source. Textron is considered the only qualified organization with the requisite skills, capabilities, system expertise, and resources to accomplish the required midsection conversion.</p>
<p>Subject to the Government's consideration, a viable source, not already qualified to provide the requisite services should submit a concise and program specific response presenting sufficient information to substantiate they have demonstrated:<br />(1) the ability to machine the MK12A RV midsection</p>
<p>(2) the equipment in place to machine the midsection and the fused quartz windows</p>
<p>(3) the ability and equipment in place to manufacture the antenna housing</p>
<p>(4) that they have trained employees with satisfactory qualifications and backgrounds which includes the ability to properly handle, manufacture, and machine Mod 5F components. Additionally, they must verify compliance with MK12A RV specifications.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Air Force will not pay for either the effort or the associated costs to respond, or for any information provided.</p>
<p>A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to information received will be normally considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Responses must be received by April 11, 2012, 4:00 pm Mountain Standard time to AFNWC/PKME, ATTN: Brad Vargo, 6014 Dogwood Ave, Bldg 1258 Room 24, Hill AFB UT 84056-5816, or bradley.vargo@hill.af.mil. No phone or FAX requests will be accepted.<br />Original Point of Contact<br />Brad Vargo, Contract Negotiator, Phone 801-775-3700, Fax null, Email bradley.vargo@hill.af.mil</p>

<DESC>Title: National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&amp;E) Service Center Capability Statement
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential vendors (including, but <br />not limited to, small business (e.g. 8 (a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women-owned small business) that can provide continuing monitoring and evaluation technical assistance for the National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&amp;E) and related software for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for up to 5 years.</p>
<p>Background: <br />In 2004, CDC responded to the need for more accurate and timely data for monitoring HIV prevention programs by developing and implementing the National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&amp;E) [formerly known as the Program Evaluation and Monitoring System (PEMS) variables]. NHM&amp;E is a national set of standardized HIV prevention data variables. To assist in the collection and reporting of the NHM&amp;E data, CDC designed and provided optional, secure web-based software for data entry and management and a range of data collection training and software implementation support services. CDC is now beginning a process of transitioning to other methods and systems of data collection and reporting. NHM&amp;E data variables are also being revised to include information on client demographics and HIV risk behaviors, community-level interventions, structural interventions, syringe exchange interventions, biomedical interventions, and types of HIV prevention efforts. Collection of these variables allows for more detailed and comprehensive reporting of HIV prevention activities including fiscal information, client service data, and data required for calculating program performance indicators. NHM&amp;E data collection and reporting is required of 69 health departments and approximately 200 community-based organizations (CBOs) funded through CDC HIV cooperative agreements to deliver or support HIV prevention services.</p>
<p>To support the successful implementation of NHM&amp;E and to meet federal data reporting and security requirements it is necessary to provide technical support by e-mail, telephone, and other means to grantees reporting NHM&amp;E data and to track and document end-user requests and responses. This technical support is intended to provide accurate, consistent communication concerning programmatic NHM&amp;E and issues related to program evaluation or data reporting, to identify elements of reporting requirement or technology needing modification, to identify grantees in need of enhanced technical assistance, to coordinate access to online and other training materials, to provide support to PEB staff training or assisting grantees, and to monitor the implementation of the NHM&amp;E data collections.<br /><br />&emsp;<br />Purpose and Objectives: <br />This is a contract for work providing programmatic technical assistance and support to grantees collecting and reporting the National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation data to CDC. Implementation, modification, and reporting of NHM&amp;E data will continue during the period covered by this contract, so continuing assistance to grantees is essential.</p>
<p>This project has multiple objectives: 1) To assist HIV prevention grantees and stakeholders in collecting and reporting NHM&amp;E data by providing e-mail, telephone, and other technical support, 2) to respond to questions and concerns related to NHM&amp;E from grantees and other stakeholders with accurate and consistent responses, 3) to identify elements of NHM&amp;E that need modification based on user reports and problems, 4) to identify grantees that need enhanced or specialized technical assistance through technical assistance provision mechanisms, 5) to coordinate access to, encourage, and enhance use of training on NHM&amp;E (including on-line training and resources), 6) to monitor compliance with federal data reporting and security requirements and maintain a database of information on each grantee agency, and 7) to provide support to the Program Evaluation Branch in communicating with, training, and providing technical support with program evaluation to grantees.</p>
<p>These objectives will be achieved by operating an "NHM&amp;E Service Center" that will have staff trained and experienced in the collection and reporting of NHM&amp;E variables who, via e-mail, telephone, and other means of communication with the grantees and other stakeholders, will track and document requests and responses. Service Center (SC) staff will respond to requests as expeditiously as possible, keep records of requests to identify reoccurring problems or questions, and provide information to staff, trainers, and software developers about areas needing attention. SC staff will also track requests by grantees. SC staff will provide information to grantees needing repeated technical support about technical assistance and training mechanisms for detailed or specialized help.</p>
<p>Specifically, the SC will assist the more than 300 directly funded grantees (health departments and community-based organizations) with the collection, management, use, and submission of NHM&amp;E data. This includes, but is not limited to, topics such as:</p>
<p>1. Collecting and managing client-level data<br />2. Collecting and managing intervention-level data<br />3. Calculating performance indicators or aggregating data<br />4. Reporting all types of data<br />5. Using data, including data extracts, exports, and reports.<br />6. Assisting grantees in their monitoring and evaluation plans and use of data<br />7. Protecting the confidentiality and security of client data</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />For grantees not using the CDC supplied software, the SC will also provide assistance in comparing their data elements to the NHM&amp;E variables so that the data reported matches the NHM&amp;E standards and is comparable on a national level. The SC will also provide responses to questions and concerns from other NHM&amp;E stakeholders, such as CDC project officers, national partners (NASTAD, NAPWA, etc.), CDC staff, and other technical support providers. In addition, the SC will provide and support to PEB staff in communicating with, training, and providing technical support on monitoring and evaluation to grantees.</p>
<p>Capability Statement:</p>
<p>Vendors who believe that they have the ability to satisfy all of the above stated objectives are encouraged to submit a capability statement. The capability statements will be evaluated based on the information provided in relation to the objectives and requirements above and the current in-house capacity to perform the work including: (a) staff availability, experience, and training; (b) prior completed projects of a similar nature; and (c) examples of prior completed contracts, dollar value of the contracts, references, and other related information. Capability statements must demonstrate the requirements outlined above.

<SUBJECT>State of the Art Trusted Foundry Services
<SOLNBR>H94003-12-RFI-001
<RESPDATE>042712
<CONTACT>Linda A. Baustian, Contract Specialist, Phone 9162311658, Fax 9162312816, Email linda.baustian@dmea.osd.mil - Kellie M. Valdez, Contracting Officer, Phone 916-231-1523, Fax 916-231-2823, Email kellie.valdez@dmea.osd.mil
<DESC><p><strong>Synopsis:<br /></strong>The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) seeks information for the purpose of obtaining access to leading edge Trusted Foundry (TF) services for meeting US Government (USG) requirements beginning in October 2013. This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. If a solicitation is released by DMEA, it will be synopsized in the FedBizOpps. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Further, neither DMEA nor the USG will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.</p>
<p><strong>Background:<br /></strong>The DoD and other USG entities require access to a wide range of microelectronics services. Ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of specialized military devices) has become increasingly challenging owing to the globalization of the integrated circuit (IC) industry.</p>
<p>The DoD Trusted Foundry Program was established to ensure mission-critical national defense systems can obtain classified (up to the SECRET level and may include NOFORN and COMSEC) and unclassified Trusted ICs, such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), from sources that have the capability to protect the confidentiality and integrity of these devices. The TF program includes accreditation of trusted sources for design, aggregation, mask manufacturing, wafer fabrication, post-processing, packaging/assembly, test, and broker services. A list of the currently accredited suppliers can be found at the DMEA website. (Ref 3) Trusted ICs require the use of trusted services throughout the supply chain. A key requirement includes access to TF capabilities (mask and wafer fabrication) for leading edge and state-of-the-art semiconductor process technologies. The DoD and NSA have requirements that include military temperature ranges and radiation hardness requirements; developing libraries and/or processes to support these needs may be required. TF access will be required by 1 October 2013 when an existing contract for such services (Ref 4) reaches the end of its contractual period of performance. Based on previously observed demand, a minimum of approximately 1200 wafers per year (8-inch equivalent) will be required from a state-of-the-art TF to fulfill USG ASIC needs. Additional quantities of wafers might also be required to supply the DoD with other types of Trusted devices (e.g., processors, FPGAs, etc.) as required by policy and effective program protection.</p>
<p>Trusted suppliers must possess and maintain a SECRET facility security clearance (Ref 5), an ISO-9001 quality system certification for any manufacturing or assembly work, and otherwise protect all trusted designs and devices with a cleared chain-of-custody (a cadre of individuals who possess personnel security clearances) including, as applicable, computer systems accredited by Defense Security Service (DSS) for processing classified information (Ref 6). DMEA works closely with trusted supplier applicants to implement security protocols for trusted services without requiring changes to ordinary commercial services. Accreditation by DMEA as a trusted supplier is required prior to performing work as a trusted foundry. Qualified companies are encouraged to contact DMEA to obtain a complete set of requirements. <br /><br /><strong>Draft Acquisition Approach: <br /></strong>&bull; 5-year contract (maximum term currently allowed)<br />&bull; Alternative business models such as Prime, Prime with Subcontractors, and&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaming will be considered <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Foundry as Prime Contractor approach<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Aggregator as Prime Contractor approach<br />&bull; Possible multi-award award indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (ID/IQ)</p>
<p><strong>Approach A: Foundry as Prime Contractor</strong> - This approach awards a contract to a TF or foundries to satisfy the requirements. Awardees would have to show how internal capabilities or a third party arrangement (e.g., with an aggregator) would be used.</p>
<p><strong>Approach B: Aggregator as Prime Contractor</strong> - This approach awards a contract to an aggregator(s) and allows them to partner with leading edge foundry(s) to satisfy the requirements. Customers (from the DoD, USG, and from their defense contractors) would access these leading edge TF services via a Trusted Aggregator, which may or may not be a third party. Awardees would have to show how internal capabilities and third party partnering (e.g., with one or more foundries) would be used.</p>

<DESC>NASA is searching for equipment capable of finding a potential ammonia leak in aheat rejection system on the International Space Station (ISS).  NASA Johnson SpaceCenter (JSC) is hereby soliciting information from potential sources for an Ammonia LeakLocator. JSC has a need for a piece of equipment capable of detecting an ammonia leak in thevacuum environment immediately external to the International Space Station.  NASA isseeking potential sources that can provide an instrument capable of locating the sourceof an ammonia leak from the ISS external heat rejection system  should one arise.  Thefluid that transfers the heat from heat exchangers to radiators is anhydrous ammonia. The ammonia lines have the possibility of leaking at any location along the lines.  NASAis searching for an instrument capable of finding a leak, so a repair can be made.  Different detection methods have different operational concepts.  One operational conceptinvolves delivering a leak detection instrument to ISS, store the device in the habitablevolume, transfer the device through the airlock in the Japanese Experiment Module, attachthe device to the robotic arm, and have the robotic arm survey the area around theammonia lines.	The technique should be capable of identifying a 0.1  20 kg/day leakfrom a distance 3 meters from the leak source.	The detector needs to operate in theexternal environment of space, with diurnal temperature swings, diurnal changes inlighting, naturally occurring species (mostly atomic oxygen), off-gas products from theISS materials, and gaseous products vented from ISS vacuum vents.Interested parties are invited to provide descriptions of their leak location systems. This description should include the following:- Description of the theory of measurement- Description of measurement capabilities    -- Sensitivity    -- Selectivity    -- Dynamic range- Description of Engineering Specifications    -- System size    -- System mass    -- System power use- Description of Performance in the ISS environment    -- Performance in a vacuum environment    -- Performance in temperature extremes    -- Power input needs, and cooling requirements    -- Data input requirements    -- Data delivery requirementsIn addition, responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size ofbusiness; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; and point ofcontact - address and phone number.

<p><br />PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The iNET program is a tri-service project that is tasked via the Director of the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP), which is a program element under the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), to enable advances in networking and telemetry technology to meet emerging needs within the Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFBs). Approximately eight years ago, the iNET project started as a study to determine the feasibility of networked telemetry. So far, the iNET program has developed a system architecture for the TmNS and a suite of standards (see attached) to address interoperability of airborne ruggedized data acquisition and networked telemetry components. The program now seeks to build advanced TmNS prototypes of these components to support testing and integration of the TmNS system within actual test platforms. It is anticipated that these components will be derived from existing commercially available products, which will be modified to meet the interface requirements defined by the iNET standards.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES:</p>
<p>See the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p>Statement of capabilities should address the vendor's knowledge of the iNET program, standards, and experience building airborne data acquisition equipment as well as their existing commercial product line.</p>
<p>In addition, the interested vendor should discuss their experience with developing and using Work Breakdown Structures and project management based on tracking Technical Performance Measures (TPMs) for development of components, along with risk tracking and mitigation.</p>
<p>The Government will assess the interested vendor's demonstrated capability to perform the tasking outlined in the draft SOW (see attached) and the specific areas noted above.</p>

Request for Information: VA701-12-I-0166
Healthcare Recruitment and Retention Office
I. Introduction:
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified sources (contractors) who are able to meet VA's requirements. Information gathered from this RFI will assist with this determination.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Healthcare Retention and Recruitment Office (HRRO) is seeking potential sources to issue a Task/Delivery Order for adding additional recruiting promotional items and management ability to the existing VHA Storefront.
 The anticipated period of performance will be one (1) year from time of award.  Exact items, quantities and delivery requirements will be identified in the task order.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  
II. Background: 
The VHA Healthcare Retention and Recruitment Office (HRRO) maintains a Storefront of promotional items used for recruitment events as marketing promotional items. This mechanism provides a one-stop option for facilities to order items at a discount as well as take advantage of VHA Branding through consistent use of the VHA recruitment message "The Best Care- The Best Careers." 
III. Requirements:  
The contractor shall act as project coordinator to oversee the account during updates, and to provide monthly reporting and maintenance. Bulk orders of give-away items for recruitment purposes shall be invoiced up front to include shipping charges when purchased by VHA. Project management fees are billed monthly as items are shipped to VA facilities under separate contract and as monthly reporting and other project management services are delivered. Managing inventory for the storefront and shipping products to VA field facilities is done by means of the storefront on contractor's website that is linked to our existing VHA Recruiters' Toolkit which allows for ease in ordering.  The contractor takes orders online, via the storefront interface, from authorized users and ships requested items to the desired location within 48 hours via USPS or comparable method to ensure delivery within no more than 7 calendar days. Expedited over night or 2-day delivery service shall be made available by the user/ordering office providing overnight account information to the contractor for direct billing. Control measures have been established by VHA Healthcare Retention and Recruiting Office. VHA (HRRO), only designated users may access the system so ordering levels may be limited per user and per request.  The Healthcare Retention and Recruitment Office receives reports of usage and inventory/stock levels on a monthly basis. 
Tasks and Associated Deliverables
Task 1:  Promotional Items
The contract shall provide a variety of low cost, low weight promotional items ordered and customized as recruitment give-away items.  Prices shall be inclusive of all setup and shipping fees.

Promotional item use will be limited to recruitment for occupation(s) considered mission critical based on the need to interest qualified applicants given current and anticipated job market conditions.  (The companion Finance policy is in MP-4, pt. V, chap. 3, paragraph 3A.13.1a, dated June 18, 1993.)

<p><br />Dear Sir/Ma'am,</p>
<p>The Hill Air Force Base EOD Sustainment Program Management Team would like to invite you to our Hook and Line Industry Day on 25 April 2012 from 0800-1600 at Hill Air Force Base.</p>
<p>The purpose of this event is to gather current information in regards to the existing Hook and Line Kits on the market. During this event, we hope to have contractor representatives come and show us their kits so we may further define our requirements to the needs of the Air Force. This will also be an opportunity for contractors to ask questions about the specifications.</p>
<p>The Industry Day will be divided up into three parts. The first part will be a introductory brief describing the current specification for the needed Hook and Line Kit. The second part will consist of contractor presentations of their kits. During this time, all other contractors will be asked to leave the room until it is their turn to present.

The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program.  The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

 Any contractor, who may have access to this sensitive data, is also required to follow the same code of behavior when dealing with such information.  In accordance with the VISN (Veterans Integrated Service Network)9 Directive 10N9-31-06, dated May 26, 2006, contractor shall  ensure that all contractor personnel with access to patient records comply with the Privacy Act  of 1974, (USC 7332 & 5701) and the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  Each contractor employee that will have access to any sensitive data will be required to abide by the conditions and security requirements noted herein.  Violations may be cause for termination of the contract.  Contractor must provide adequate on-site security of your facilities, equipment, and software where patient information is stored, utilized, or accessed, to ensure protection from hazard, theft, and unauthorized access.

a.	 SECURING SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS:  Forms and other types of printed output produced by any computer system will be evaluated by the responsible staff member for data sensitivity.  Printed output containing sensitive data should be labeled as such, stored in locked cabinets or desks, and disposed of properly by shredding or placement in specially marked containers.  All employees are responsible for retrieving all printed outputs they request from printers or facsimile machines.  Data files, documentation, and other back-up materials will be stored in areas controlled by locks or personnel to prevent unauthorized access.

(1)	Contractor(s) shall insure the confidentiality of all patient and employee information and shall be held liable in the event of breach of confidentiality according to federal regulations contained in HIPAA.  Any person, who knowingly or willingly discloses confidential information from the VA Medical Center, may be subject to fines of up to $50,000.00 and may be subjected to civil litigation from the patient.
(2)	Records:  Contractor(s) personnel who obtain access to hardware or media which may manipulate or store drug or alcohol abuse data, sickle cell anemia treatment records, records or tests or treatment for or infection with HIV, medical quality assurance records, or any other sensitive information protected under 38 U.S.C. 4132 or 3305, as defined by the Department of Veterans Affairs, shall not have access to the records unless absolutely necessary to perform their contractual duties. Any individual who has access to these data will disclose them to no one, including other employees of the Contractor(s) not involved in the performance of the particular contractual duty for which access was obtained.  Violation of these statutory provisions, as stated in department regulations by the Contractor(s)'s employees may involve imposition of criminal penalties.

b.	 COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSMISSIONS SECURITY (HIPAA 164.312e; FISMA 8.2):

(1)	 Facsimile (Fax) Machines (if utilized for submission of reports):   Individuals who FAX sensitive or confidential information must ensure the FAX is sent to the appropriate individual and they are aware the information is to be protected from unauthorized use.
a.	Fax transmissions will contain a cover sheet with the following statement:  "This fax is intended only for the use of the person or office to which it is addressed and may contain information that is privileged, confidential, or protected by law.  All others are hereby notified that the receipt of this fax does not waive any applicable privilege or exemption for disclosure and that any dissemination, distribution, or copying of this communication is prohibited.  If you have received this fax in error, please notify this office immediately at the telephone number listed above."  HIPAA regulations apply to all faxes transmitted to or from electronic devices.
b.	Contractor staff shall ensure the correct recipient's fax number is entered prior to transmittal.  Delivery must be confirmed by telephoning the recipient, E-mail confirmation of FAX receipt, or review of fax transmittal confirmation sheet.
c.	Fax machines should be placed in areas secured by physical access controls that require security keys, badges, or similar mechanisms in order to gain access.
d.	Fax machines should have pre-programmed and tested destination numbers entered to minimize the potential for human error.

(2)	 E-mail (if utilized for submission of reports):  The transmission of e-mail messages containing sensitive information or ePHI via Outlook, must be done in a secure manner, i.e. encryption.  PKI is the only approved method of encryption for the VA.  A PKI certificate can be obtained by contacting the facility ISO.

       c.     RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSMISSION, TRANSPORTATION AND USE OF, AND ACCESS TO,
               VA DATA OUTSIDE VA FACILITIES 

(1)	 VA information may not reside on non-VA systems or devices unless specifically designated and approved in advance by the appropriate VA official (supervisor), and only where the non-VA systems or devices conform to, or exceed, applicable VA security policies or are specifically authorized by VA guidance.

(2)	 VA Protected Information (VAPI) must not be transmitted by remote access unless VA-approved protection mechanisms are used.  All encryption modules used to protect VA data must be validated by NIST to meet the currently applicable version of Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140 (See http://csrc.nist.gov/crypval/140-1/1401val.htm for a complete list of validated cryptographic modules).  Only approved encryption solutions using validated modules may be used when protecting data during transmission.

(3)	Passwords or other authentication information must not be stored on remote systems unless encrypted.  VA-PKI certificates must be stored in encrypted form only and must be accessible only by using a personal identification number (PIN) or password.

(4)	Data Stored - Encryption.  Additional security controls are required to guard VAPI stored on computers outside VA facilities.  All VAPI stored on the computer, file or electronic storage media must be encrypted using VA-approved protection mechanisms (see bullet two, above).

(5)	Equipment must be housed and protected to reduce the risks from environmental threats and hazards, and the opportunities for unauthorized access, use, or removal.

(6)	Portable computers that have VAPI on their storage device(s) or have software that provides access to VA private networks must be secured under lock and key when not in immediate vicinity of responsible individual.  This includes external hard drives and other storage devices.

(7)	Data and system backups that include VA information have the same confidentiality classification as the originals.  Therefore, these materials must be protected with the same or equally effective physical security as that provided to the source computer, its media, and information contained therein.

(8)	All individually identifiable health records/information shall be treated with the strictest confidentiality.  Access to records shall be limited to essential personnel only.  Records shall be secured when not in use.

(9)	The Contractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies.  If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.

(10)	The Contractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to
        perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on Contractors 
        electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the 
        Contractor  needs to be restored to an operating state.  If copies are made for restoration purposes, 
        after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

(11)	 Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the    
  contract, the Contractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response 
  to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, and (ii) with VA's prior written approval.  The

<SUBJECT>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)- Mold Production and Characterization
<SOLNBR>NIHES-428-2012

<CONTACT>Patrick P Barbour, Contract Specialist , Phone 919-541-7596, Email barbourp@niehs.nih.gov - JoAnn K Lewis, Supervisory Contracting Officer, Phone 919-541-7894, Fax 919-541-2712, Email lewisj@niehs.nih.gov
<DESC>Request For Information<br />"Mold Production and Characterization"
<p>"This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes."<br />Background - The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is one of 27 institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The mission of the NIEHS is to reduce the burden of human illness and disability by understanding how the environment influences the development and progression of human disease. To have the greatest impact on preventing disease and improving human health, the NIEHS focuses on basic science, disease-oriented research, global environmental health, and multidisciplinary training for researchers. The NIEHS achieves its mission through<br />&bull;	Extramural research and training, funded by grants and contracts, to scientists, environmental health professionals, and other groups worldwide;<br />&bull;	Intramural research conducted by scientists at the NIEHS facility and in partnership with scientists at universities and hospitals;<br />&bull;	Outreach and communications programs that provide reliable health information to the public and scientific resources to researchers; and<br />&bull;	Toxicological testing and test validation by the National Toxicology Program (NTP).<br />The NTP is an interagency program whose mission is to evaluate agents of public health concern by developing and applying tools of modern toxicology and molecular biology. The program maintains an objective, science-based approach in dealing with critical issues in toxicology and is committed to using the best science available to prioritize, design, conduct, and interpret its studies. To that end, the NTP is continually evolving to remain at the cutting edge of scientific research and to develop and apply new technologies.<br />Molds include a variety of species of microscopic fungi that grow in the form of multicellular filaments, called hyphae. A connected network of branching hyphae is considered a single organism and is referred to as a "colony". A mold colony is often found in association with bacteria, which themselves vary depending on the nature of the mold colony including the species of mold present and the substrate upon which the colony is growing. Molds reproduce through the production of spores which are typically unicellular but can be sexual or asexual. Many species of fungi produce both types of spores. Spores can remain airborne indefinitely and are able to survive extreme fluctuations in temperature and humidity; once conditions are favorable the spore can develop into a new organism via mitotic division, producing a multicellular gametophyte, which eventually goes on to produce gametes. Common indoor molds include species of Cladosporium, Penicillium, Alternaria, and Aspergillus and under some conditions Stachybotrys. Some molds are used in the production of foods, beverages, antibiotics and enzymes, whereas others have been associated with human disease, particularly allergic reactions in sensitive people.<br />Exposure to elevated levels of indoor mold has been associated with a number of symptoms: allergies, asthma, hives, itching, cancer, central nervous system problems, recurring colds, chronic cough, dermatitis, diarrhea, eye/vision problems, flu-like symptoms, headaches, hemorrhagic and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, kidney failure, and mental dysfunction including learning difficulties, personality changes, and memory loss.<br />The Institute of Medicine has reported on the associations between exposure to damp indoor environments containing mold and human disease outcomes in Damp Indoor Spaces and Health, (The National Academy of Sciences, 2004). In this report the authors conclude that there is sufficient evidence of an association between exposure to damp indoor environments and some respiratory health outcomes in sensitized persons; suggestive evidence of an association between damp indoor environments and respiratory illness in otherwise healthy children; and insufficient evidence for determination of whether damp environments are related to a variety of health outcomes, including any association with Stachybotrys chartarum. The authors of the report identify many data gaps with respect to the role of mold in the areas of neurotoxicology, rheumatic diseases, reproductive effects and cardiopulmonary disease. In addition, it is unclear whether respiratory effects seen in otherwise healthy children exposed to damp environments are related to mold, bacteria, dust mites, cockroaches, or a combination thereof.<br />Molds were nominated by an individual for study by the National Toxicology Program. In 2004 the NTP Board of Scientific Councilors and the Executive Committee endorsed the study of molds and suggested that the program consider studying organisms commonly found in indoor air (i.e.; Aspergillus and Penicillium) as well as Stachybotrys. In 2007 an Expert Review Panel was convened by the NTP to discuss study design. This panel identified several key areas, including growing conditions, life stage, and physical and chemical properties of molds as having a direct bearing on study design and potential study outcomes. Key recommendations of the panel were the use of single organisms as well as molds co-cultured on different building materials; production of a sufficient quantity of each mold, or mold co-culture that were harvested at a particular growth stage and dried for use in the entire study; and characterization of molds with respect to mycotoxins, glucans, allergens, particle size, protease activity, colony forming units, and spores. <br />Purpose and Objectives - The purpose of this requirement will be the production of 6 molds in bulk form (dry powder), which will subsequently be used in NTP Toxicity testing. Molds to be produced will consist of two varieties of Stachybotrys sp. A greenish-black fungus that is found worldwide:<br />&bull;	Stachybotrys chartarum isolate 1, a macrocyclic trichothecene chemotype; and<br />&bull;	Stachybotrys chartarum isolate 2, an antranone chemotype<br />Aspergillus versicolor, which is common on gypsum board, floor, carpet, mattress, and upholstered furniture dust, and damp walls; and Alternaria alternata, which is commonly isolated from plants, soil, food, and indoor air environment and is important in allergy, infection, and asthma severity.<br />The NTP also plans to produce bulk quantities of two mold mixtures for subsequent testing, including a representative mold sample from a house damaged in Hurricane Katrina and a mold mixture from a known sick building.</p>
<p>Project Requirements - The Tasks that will be performed under this requirement involve the processes, procedures, and facilities needed to grow and maintain mold colonies, collect and dry the mold to produce a powder suitable for use in inhalation studies, microscopically and chemically characterize, and determine the viability of mold colonies and the powdered material produced from them, and safely handle (store, ship, and/or manipulate) mold colonies and the produced powder, including providing written protocols documenting all procedures used. Mold colonies and mold powders will minimally be chemically characterized for mycotoxins, glucans, allergens, particle size, protease activity, colony forming units, spores, and endotoxins. Microscopic characterization will involve the identification of the significant mold species and exogenous substances present in the mold colony or powder. This effort has been divided into 8 objectives covering the program management and technical aspects of this project: <br />1.	Program Management<br />&bull;	Project management includes contract start-up, customer service, and continuity of services activities. <br />&bull;	An effective Quality Assurance program, including a Quality Management Plan and SOPs for all work performed by the contract.<br />&bull;	Effective communication between the Contractor and the NTP.<br />&bull;	Implementation of an effective Information Management System including bioinformatics. <br />&bull;	An effective health and safety program to ensure that work performed under the contract is done safely<br />&bull;	Provision of adequate oversight so that work is completed in a timely and cost effective manner. <br />&bull;	Accurate and timely reporting of financial data, administrative data, and work performed on the contract.<br />2.	Procure, collect and/or isolate fungus<br />&bull;	Procure fungi from commercial and/or academic sources and/or collect representative samples from a specified mold colony. <br />&bull;	Isolate a single fungus species/strain from a multi-species source colony<br />3.	Establish production colony<br />&bull;	Activities associated with growing a specific fungal strain (or strains) from a commercial colony or a colony provided by the NTP or its designee. <br />o	The colony may consist of a single fungus, or may be a mixture of several fungi and bacteria. <br />o	The colony may be grown on a real-world substrate (e.g., gypsum board) or other substrate.<br />4.	Develop methods<br />&bull;	Development of microscopic methods to identify fungi present in a mold sample, confirm the presence of spores or spore fragments from marker organisms, identify bacteria present in a mold sample, and or provide a qualitative assessment of the homogeneity of a specified mold composite or sample.<br />&bull;	Develop genetic or cell-based methods to confirm the identity of fungi and/or bacteria present in a mold sample or material, determine the number of colony-forming units in a mold sample or material. Determine the mutagenicity, cellular toxicity, or other endpoints for a mold or specified material.<br />&bull;	Development of analytical methods for the characterization of a mold colony or powder with respect to homogeneity, particle size, species present (including colony forming units), mycotoxin, glucan, and allergen content, protease activity, other chemicals present, and presence of exogenous materials.<br />5.	Scale-up<br />&bull;	Development of procedures that will be used to produce a sufficiently large amount of a specified mold for use in a subsequent toxicology study. <br />&bull;	Activities that are associated with growing a sufficient quantity of a specified fungus or fungi derived from one or more production colonies to produce the required amount of dried material.<br />&bull;	The contractor will be expected to target the amount of fungi produced to an NTP-specified target mass of dried, processed fungus powder needed for a particular study, which is anticipated to be in the range of &lt;100 g to ~50 kg.<br />6.	Produce dried material<br />&bull;	Activities needed to produce a dried material composed of a dried fungus or fungi fragments, including spores. These activities are divided into pilot-scale and bulk-scale activities, which are distinguished by the amount of dried material produced.<br />o	The NTP anticipates that amounts of dried, sized material will range from &lt; 100 g to ~50 kg for pilot-scale and bulk-scale production, respectively.<br />&bull;	In some cases the dried material will be further processed to meet mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) requirements for NTP inhalation studies (typically &lt; 2 &micro;m). <br />7.	Characterization<br />&bull;	All of the tests required to characterize the mold or finished dried, sized powder with respect to content (i.e., mold spores present; presence of hyphae or other fungal material; species and strain of fungus (or fungi) present; presence, and type (including species and strain) of bacteria; presence, and concentration of marker chemical compounds; presence, and type of substrate particles or other exogenous materials, including metals; particle size, colony forming units and enzyme activity.<br />8.	Materials handling<br />&bull;	Activities related to collecting, storing, manipulating, and shipping mold, mold colonies, and dried mold powders obtained or produced by the contractor.<br />Successful contractors shall have the ability to perform the program management objective and assignments in at least two of the 7 technical objective areas, however, a single contractor need not have the capability to perform all of the assignments in all of the technical objective areas.</p>
<p><br />Technical Objective	Anticipated Number of Assignments per Year<br />Procure, collect and/or isolate fungus	2<br />Establish production colony	2<br />Develop methods	5<br />Scale-up	2<br />Produce dried material	2 (pilot-scale), 1 (bulk-scale)<br />Characterization	3<br />Materials handling	20</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance - The Base Contract is anticipated from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2016 with 7 optional 1 year periods of performance.  If all options are exercised the period of performance shall extend through June 30, 2022.  <br />Other important considerations - Most of the testing performed under this contract shall be conducted in accordance with applicable GLP guidelines and where appropriate, NTP specifications (NTP, 2011).  The contractor must have a currently functioning laboratory with demonstrated capability in related work.  Combinations of assignments from different objectives will be considered single tasks with the understanding that multiple functional areas from different objectives will be needed to produce a required outcome. For example, an assignment to establish a production colony of S. chartarum may include obtaining the S. chartarum sample, establishing the colony, performing a qualitative assessment of the composition of the colony, and looking for marker compounds or performing a PCR analysis to confirm the presence of the desired mold species and strain (or absence of an undesired species and/or strain).  The actual number of tasks will vary based on programmatic needs and availability of funds.  <br />Information sought - Respondents, please provide opinion(s) about the difficulty and/or feasibility of proposing the potential requirement as a cost reimbursement type contract. Provide possible solutions and approaches that may currently exist in the marketplace for procuring the outlined services under cost type contracts.  <br />Submission requirements - Responses must be received by April 30, 2012 3:00pm EST. Submit responses to the Contract Specialist identified above. The information can be provided in writing or electronically in Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word format.  If hard copies are provided please submit an original and four (4) copies. Telephonic and facsimile responses will not be accepted.  Limit responses to seven (7) pages maximum. Include the Request for Information (RFI) number and title in your response.  Respondents are also asked to provide the following:  DUNS number, organization name, address, technical and administrative points of contact (including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses), and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB, SDVOSB, etc.)<br />"Disclaimer and Important Notes.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure supplies /service from&nbsp;Ocean Innovations located in La Jolla, CA&nbsp;for the US Department of<br />Commerce, NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service for In-stream PIT tag detection requires the installation of RF antennas in a range of river and flow conditions across the watershed of the Columbia River basin. The tag detection electronics must be on-shore for power and data download access, so the connection of the antennas to their controlling transceiver must be accomplished by antenna cable capable of withstanding the stresses of immersion and abrasion. The cable must have the electrical properties determined by the tag antenna frequency (~134kHz) and the power range (&lt;1kW). Additionally, because tag detection is accomplished by antenna field modification rather than simple detection, the entire antenna assembly must operate in a low-noise environment. The cabling between the antenna and the transceiver is an integral part of the antenna assembly, and therefore must conform to the systems rigorous performance constraints.
<p>The required cable must be waterproof and must be able to withstand considerable abrasion. A polyurethane coating, at least 0.06" in thickness, of hardness 85C is required. The exact formulation of the coating material may be proprietary, but must be designed to bond to the base cable, provide waterproofing both as direct water penetration and gaseous permeability that would affect capacitance, and provide abrasion resistance. Standard off the shelf tri-axial cable is not rated for underwater use because the cable construction does not control humidity sufficiently to maintain the cables capacitance rating. This cable is being used as part of an RF antenna, so the capacitance of the cable is critical. Waterproofing usually is concerned w/ resistance separation between conductors, but capacitance is much more critical in this case and is affected by humidity w/in the cable long before there is actual water penetration that impacts resistance.</p>
<p>The antenna cable will be subject to considerable movement; therefore, the components of the cable must be able to resist internal wear and deformation. The co-axial component must be build with nitrogen-gas injected foam polyethylene dielectric, rather than a hollow tube air or traditional foam dielectric. Gas injected foam is capable of much higher velocities compared to traditional chemical foam technology and are comparable to velocities supported by the air gap dielectric designs. Additionally, the gas injection process has a negligible residual effect as compared to the chemical foaming process, improving the overall dissipation factor of the dielectric material. Besides the dissipation factor, chemically-foamed cable typically suffers from center conductor migration. Because the elasticity of the conductor material and the polyethylene is quite different, over time the conductor will creep or cold flow through the polyethylene. Conductor migration is accelerated when the cable is continuously flexed, as it will be in this application. This migration will radically alter the impedance at that point, causing serious VSWR, and dramatically reduce the voltage-breakdown ratings. To avoid this poor mechanical performance the requested cable must utilizes gas-injected high-density polyethylene. In high-density polyethylene foam, cell walls are more uniform and very stiff, resisting center conductor migration and maintaining an consistent impedance tolerance of 50 &plusmn; 2 ohms. In additionally, because of the continual flexion, the center conductor construction of the requested cable must be stranded rather than solid.</p>
<p>The electrical properties of the required cable in the frequency and power range of the PIT tag antenna application have been developed by the PIT tag transceiver manufacturer (Digital Angel). All replacement cable must functionally and electronically interchangable with current cables in use.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>Custom 50 ohm Triax cable Construction specifications:<br />Inner conductor: 7/.0380" Bare Copper - diameter 0.108" nominal.<br />Dielectric: Foamed Polyethylene - diameter 0.285" nominal<br />Outer conductor: Bonded Aluminum foil + Tinned Copper Braid<br />Jacket: Thermoplastic Elastomer - diameter 0.405" nominal.<br />Outer shield: Tinned Copper Braid <br />082" wall Black outer Poly-U jacket.<br />Finished diameter 0.600" nominal.</p>

In accordance with FAR 6.305, FAR 5.406, and FAR 13.501, this special notice publishes the Justification and Approvals for Other than Full and Open Competition. This is not a request for competitive proposals, bids, or quotes. The Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please email Contract Specialist, Christie VandenDries, at christie_vandendries@nps.gov with responses or questions regarding this requirement.
Background:  Fish inventory sampling to be conducted in rivers and streams along the Malaspina forelands adjacent to Yakutat Bay with a focus on rainbow smelt presence during the spring and longfin smelt presence in the fall.  1.  FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  No other experienced fisheries consulting contractor is available in the Yakutat area.  Contractors from elsewhere will have to travel  to Yakutat by plane or boat seven times throughout the summer with all of their sampling and camping gear and charter a plane to get to the sampling streams, charter a plane to move between the sampling sites; or will have to travel to Yakutat by boat. 2.  Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.April - June 2012: biweekly overnight fish inventory sampling events in selected streams and rivers adjacent to Yakutat Bay from Point Manby to Esker Stream on the Malaspina forelands for a total of four to five biweekly sampling efforts.  Another two to three biweekly sampling events will take place in August/September.  There will be a total of at least seven of these overnight events.  Each event will sample at least two streams/rivers in the signified area within Wrangell-St. Elias National Park's boundaries.  In order to follow previous sampling efforts in NPS's freshwater fish inventory, a variety of sampling gear should be used including but not limited to electrofishing (the operator needs to be certified), beach seining, and 12-24 hour hoop trap soaks.  
3.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights etc.).  The Yakutat Salmon Board, a division of the City & Borough of Yakutat, performs fisheries work in the Yakutat area.  It has a vessel docked in the Yakutat harbor that will be able to perform the necessary fisheries work.  This contract will involve at least 7 overnight sampling efforts, each taking place on at least two rivers/streams.  Extent of the project area covers approximately twenty miles.  Moving back and forth between the streams within this distance with all the sampling and camping gear probably requires either a sea-worthy vessel or chartering with one of the local air taxis, a costly undertaking (current rate for a Cessna 206 is $450/hour).  Also, coastal weather is not always conducive to flying or sailing.  Seven 2-day sampling trips to the forelands could easily turn into longer events than originally predicted and there could be several days of down time, either stuck in Yakutat or at the sampling sites, also a costly undertaking.  A local contractor would be better able to judge when the weather will be acceptable for working and will have the option to choose another day for sampling.  The local contractor can also rely on local knowledge to narrow down the possible timing and location of these smelt species.  
4.  A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  Oceanlogic, the only fishery consultants that I could find by phone and online that I could find in the Juneau area, does not do work in Yakutat.  ABR, an environmental research firm based in Fairbanks, is not interested in giving us a bid that will fall within our budget constraints.  Bill Lucey, has worked as a fish biologist in Yakutat since 1995, for USFS and for the City of Yakutat.  He is currently the coordinator for the Yakutat Salmon Board, a division of the City and Borough of Yakutat.  The Yakutat Salmon Board is part of the Southeast Alaska Watershed Coalition and has worked on other projects with NOAA, USFS, USFWS, and the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe. 
5.  There are no additional facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.  All actions have been taken to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source ? Consensus Paper on Clinical Guidance for Applications of Computed Tomography in Emergency Medicine
March 27, 2012
Procurement Office:  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Administrative Contract Service Center (3803R), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, DC 20460
Response Date/Time: April 4, 2012
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Administration and Resources Management (OARM) in Washington, DC, intends to award a Purchase Order to the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements Inc. (NCRP) of Bethesda, MD, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The purpose of this purchase order is to procure a consensus report from an unbiased panel of experts that will provide clinical guidance on the appropriate use of computed tomography in hospital emergency departments.  The anticipated due date for the final consensus paper is September 30, 2012.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690.    NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   It has been determined that NCRP is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government?s requirement for the following reasons:
NCRP is the only qualified organization that can prepare the Consensus Paper described in the Statement of Work for the following reasons:
?	NCRP produced Report 160 which is the current and definitive reference for sources of exposure to the U.S. population from medical imaging procedures.  There are no other published references on the subject and any author of the Consensus Paper would draw all or most of its information from the Report 160. 
?	The proposed content for the Consensus Paper is also expected to draw heavily from the 26 professional presentations that were given at the September 2009 NCRP-sponsored workshop on  ?Computed Tomography in Emergency Medicine: Ensuring Appropriate Use.?  Because NCRP hosted the workshop, it is the only source of all of this compiled presentation content.  There are no known alternative sources for such information such that another contractor could conceivably use prepare the Consensus Paper.
?	The NCRP is the only domestic, congressionally chartered non-profit advisory organization dedicated to providing guidance on radiation protection and measurement.  There are no known organizations, private or public, that have a comparable level of expertise in radiation protection and measurement. 
Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA?s requirement, as stated herein, may submit their corporate capabilities, which, if received by the response date of this announcement, may be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing and submitted to Ben Shih, Contract Specialist, to shih.benjamin@epa.gov.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Ben Shih, Contract Specialist, via e-mail to shih.benjamin@epa.gov.

Previously, in 2011, under this work unit, 57-9513, NRL delivered six low-rate initial procurement (LRIP) Medusa subsystems to Argon ST, the Navy's prime contractor for SSEE Inc-F systems, for integration and delivery to the fleet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">PMW-120 is now requesting an additional six full-rate production (FRP) Medusa subsystems to be delivered to Argon ST in 2012. This procurement of six field-programmable gate array (FPGA) processor boards is to support these six FRP systems.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">NRL intends to award this requirement as a sole source to Annapolis Micro Systems because it is the only provider of the exact commercial-off-the-shelf configuration of the FPGA processor board required by the Medusa subsystem.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334418 with the size standard of 500 employees. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotes; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation and technical capabilities, which, if received within fifteen calendar days of publication of this notice, shall be considered by NRL. All responses must be submitted to the government point of contact at the e-mail address shown below.

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation.

   The following provisions are incorporated into 52.212-1 as an addendum to this solicitation:
	52.217-5	EVALUATION OF OPTIONS	JUL 1990
	52.225-25	PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING WITH	NOV 2011

  E.1  52.212-2  EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
 
   (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation factors below. The Government intends to award without discussion with respective offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the best terms from a technical and price standpoint. The Government however, reserves the rights to conduct discussion if deemed to be in its best interest. Furthermore, if discussions are to be conducted the Government will establish a competitive range. The competitive range shall be comprised of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency pursuant to FAR 15.306 (c) (2). The evaluation factors used to evaluate offers are as follows:

    Technical Acceptability
    Past Performance
    Price
 
   Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.
 
   (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
 
   (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
 
                            (End of Provision)

     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

     (2) __ Outside the United States.

       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

                         (End of Provision)
 
   (e) EVALUATION APPROACH
 
 1. TECHNICAL:
 
 (i) Assessment:  The Government will assess each area of the technical proposal to ensure the offeror meets or exceeds the standards of the contract.  The Government will evaluate the technical proposal based on the information provided in the Technical Volume.  The Government will infer from the offeror's responses to the required information the offeror's capability to perform to the requirements of the entire SOW.  In order to be considered for award, the offeror must demonstrate the ability to provide adequate and qualified staff and expertise to satisfy the statement of work requirements by describing or providing the information requested in the Technical Volume
 
  2.  PAST PERFORMANCE:
 
 (i) Factor Assessment: The purpose of Past Performance evaluation is to assess the degree of confidence the Government will have in an Offeror's ability to provide services that meet customer needs.  The Past Performance evaluation will assess how relevant the Offeror's contracts on previous efforts of similar size and scope to this acquisition have been rated by their customers.  The evaluation will focus on and target performance that is relevant to the principal tasks of the SOW, (i.e. providing annual preventive maintenance services for Arjo Patient Lifting Devices as stated in the SOW).   More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the performance confidence assessment than less recent and/or less relevant effort.  A performance confidence rating will be assigned based on the offeror's ability to perform the requirements of this solicitation
 
  (ii)  Description of factor:
 
 (A) The Government will conduct a past performance review of each competitive offeror.  Evaluations will be based on present and past performance information provided by the Offeror and gathered from various sources.  In addition to the information provided by the Offeror's customers, the Government reserves the right to use data obtained from other Government and commercial sources.
 
 (B) Recent:  A contract is considered recent when performance of the effort is ongoing or has been completed within the past 3 years.  Current performance will have a greater impact in the confidence assessment than less recent performance.
 
 (C) Relevancy:  The government will perform an independent determination of data relevancy, provided or obtained.  The main assessment of relevancy focuses on capability and magnitude.  Capability assesses whether the work being performed in the reference is similar to the work in our requirement.  Magnitude defines whether the amount of work in the reference is similar to the amount of work in our requirement.  An effort is considered relevant when there is a logical connection with document destruction services.  The scope of past performance information in value and size shall also be considered in determining relevancy.   More relevant performance will have a greater impact on the confidence assessment than less relevant effort.
 
 (D) Performance:  The government will perform an independent determination for each contract reference, provided or obtained.
 
 (iii) A lack of relevant past performance information shall be rated as an unknown performance risk, having no positive or negative significance.  A strong record of relevant or semi-relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than a "Neutral/Unknown confidence" rating.  Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance.
 
 (v) Where the performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems.  The Government will also consider the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised) to resolve problems.  Offerors will have the opportunity to address any negative or adverse past performance information received during this evaluation (subject to the restrictions of FAR 15.306 (e) (4), for which they have not had an opportunity to address in the past.
 
 3. PRICE:
 
 (i) Factor Assessment:  This criteria evaluates the overall price (i.e. aggregate for all five years of performance) to determine if the proposed price is fair and reasonable.  The Government may determine an offer unacceptable if the proposed prices are materially unbalanced which is defined as significantly understated or overstated in relation to the actual cost of that work or when the price is determined not to be fair and reasonable. The individual unit prices listed in Price Schedule will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed by FAR 15.404-1(b).
 
 (ii) Ratings:  Price proposals will be evaluated, but not rated.
 
 (iii) Description of factor:  The Government will conduct a price review of each contract line item.  Evaluations will be based on a comparison of the aggregate price of all offerors.  The aggregate price is the sum of all contract line items 0001 through 0005.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Disposable Underpads. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) West is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.</strong></p>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center,, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgery Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Region, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is August 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <br />Points of Contact: Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, (619) 532-8537; and Cheryl Janus, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, (619) 532-7554. </strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Disposable Underpads. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,733,868.25. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, the top fifty two (52) of the total eighty four (84) line items represent the top ten (10) products and account for 84.14% ($1,458,961.74) of the total volume in sales ($1,733,868.25) in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, Ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, and Ms. Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst, cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO West via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO West reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. </strong></p>
<p>1. Vendors must provide a complete line of Disposable Underpads. This product line includes nonsterile, latex-free/safe Disposable Underpads in various approximate sizes and levels of absorbency to include at a minimum the specific products listed.<br />a.</p>

Vendor must have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Disposable Underpads, or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements.<br />4. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative when pricing is requested in Phase III. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by the terms of the DAPA to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in Phase III for all products will be disqualified.<br />5. Vendor must indicate country from which each line item is an end product, IAW Trade Agreements Act. Vendors having existing DAPA numbers must also ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country in the DAPA Management System. Additionally, vendors are advised that the Berry Amendment may apply to this SA, subject to the June 13, 2001 "Class Determination of Domestic Non-Availability for Defense Supply Center Philadelphia Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Programs.</p>
<p>Phase II Clinical Performance Evaluation<br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO West, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the specific CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation in Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after issue of notice, and arrive at the designated addresses for each MTF by 5:00PM local time before the 30th calendar day. Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor must send the MMESO West verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. Twenty (20) each of the items listed below is to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>UNDERPAD DISPOSABLE 23-25INX34-36IN, SUPER ABSORBENCY <br />UNDERPAD DISPOSABLE 17-19INX23-25IN, MODERATE ABSORBENCY</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately fourteen (14) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. National Patient Safety Goal - NPSG #7 - Prevention of Hospital-Acquired Infection - The underpad's backing protects linen from wetness. The underpad's ability to protect linen from fluids/wetness will also protect the patient from direct contact with bodily fluid/wetness which soaks into the bed linen and causes skin breakdown that becomes a portal for infection.<br />2. National Patient Safety Goal - NPSG #7 - Prevention of Hospital-Acquired Infection; and, patient comfort - The core material of the underpad wicks fluid/wetness away from the patient's body. Any fluid/wetness which pools underneath the patient's body will directly contribute to skin irritation and inflammatory response, and provides a portal for infection. The patient's sensation of lying in a pool of fluid/wetness is uncomfortable and disconcerting to their sense of well being. <br />3. National Patient Safety Goal - NPSG #7 - Prevention of Hospital-Acquired Infection; and, patient comfort - The underpad does not tear or shred during use. An underpad which shreds or tears results in abrasive and bulky material against the patient's skin. This bulky and abrasive material can be damaging to the patient's skin, causing irritation, inflammation and breaks in the skin that lead to infection. The patient's sensation of lying on bulky and abrasive material is uncomfortable and disconcerting to their sense of well being.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs.<strong> Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West and must be received by 5:00PM PST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong> The selected Vendor of Choice will have an opportunity to provide other items beyond the minimum required product line to be considered for addition to the Incentive Agreement with a discount from DAPA. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>Special Notice - It is the National Energy Technology Laboratory?s (NETL) intent to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to General Projection Systems, Inc. to design and install wireless microphones to augment the current microphones in two conference rooms at NETL.
This is considered a sole source to General Projection Systems because the modification of the NETL conference rooms' audio systems must be completed by the company that holds the maintenance contract for the audio/visual systems.  General Projection Systems must perform this requirement to ensure the installation of the new systems does not void the existing maintenance coverage on the audio/visual systems in the two conference rooms.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items using simplified acquisition procedures and prepared in accordance with format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.<br /><br />The full text of Request for Quotation (RFQ) RFQ-NCI-10007-AS may be accessed through the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Office of Acquisitions homepage by using the following internet address - http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/index.jsp. (Please click on Current Request for Proposals to access). Only electronic copies of the solicitation are available. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above internet site for the solicitation and any amendments. POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS. No collect calls will be accepted.
<p>This project is funded thorough the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the act. <br /><br />It is anticipated this solicitation will result in multiple awards. <br /><br />Awards resulting from this solicitation No. RFQ-NCI-10007-AS will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect at the time of award for commercial items using simplified procedures.</p>
<p>Under this RFQ, the offeror shall provide clinically annotated biospecimens to TCGA for the following cancer types: Hepatocellular carcinoma, Head and neck (oral) squamous cell carcinoma, Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, Uterine Corpus (endometrial carcinoma), Astrocytoma, Cutaneous melanoma, Other Cancer Types Currently Not Identified.</p>
<p>The NCI is expanding its basic and translational research programs that rely heavily on sufficient availability of high quality well annotated biospecimens suitable for use in genomic studies. The NCI's overarching goal with such programs is to improve the ability to diagnose, treat, and prevent cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), one such program, is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies. The NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) launched TCGA as a 3-year pilot project in 2006, and have since (August 2009) initiated the second phase of the project to study at least 20 additional cancers over 5 years. This project aims to systematically explore the entire spectrum of genomic changes involved in human cancer. Specifically, the project is designed to comprehensively analyze DNA copy number changes, including large (on the order of chromosome segments) and small (1,000-100,000 kb) scale rearrangements, transcription profiles, epigenetic modifications, sequence variation, and sequence in both tumor tissue and case-matched germline DNA. The suite of analysis platforms will be applied to a common set of molecular analytes obtained from clinically annotated high-quality tumor biospecimens and case-matched normal tissue (control). More detailed information can be found at the project's website: http://cancergenome.nih.gov. To successfully generate comprehensive data in phase two, TCGA will need in excess of 40,000 biospecimens over course of the project.</p>

Specifically, a detailed list of peer reviewed publications from roughly 100,000 (expected range 90,000-110,000) individuals who have submitted grant applications to CSR. This dataset requires experts to construct and curate it.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to conduct evaluations of peer review at NIH.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>The contractor shall supply bibliometric data from the Scopus database from years 2006 - 2011 for a list of scientists provided by CSR, which will provide applicant name and institution for the set of individuals for which information is required.</p>

<p>VIII. FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, is applicable to this requirement. All Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses may be viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html</p>
<p>IX. FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is applicable to this requirement. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: A) Technical Capability; B) Past Performance and C) Price.</p>
<p>Past Performance will not be evaluated on quotations that are determined to be technically unacceptable. Price shall not be evaluated on quotations that are determined technically unacceptable in accordance with the Technical Evaluation factors.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS: <br />A. Technical Capability: The offeror shall demonstrate successful performance and the ability to perform this requirement within the required period of performance.</p>
<p>B. Past Performance: The offeror's past performance information will be evaluated subsequent to the technical evaluation. However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any offeror whose quotation is determined to be technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.</p>
<p>The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p>The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information.</p>
<p>When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. <br /><br />The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.</p>
<p>C) Price: An evaluation of the offeror's price quotation will be made to determine if proposed prices are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the technical quotation. Reasonableness determinations will be made by determining if competition exists, by comparing proposed prices with established commercial or GSA price schedules (if applicable), and/or by comparing proposed prices with the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE).</p>

<p>The lab at NIH has several chambers and equipment from Med Associates and in order to maintain compatibility and reduce variables it is best not to have boxes and chambers from multiple vendors. Med Associates boxes are the only known boxes that allow for multiple modes of drug-delivery to the animals and give flexibility such as the boxes allow for duel self-administration capabilities, including oral and intravenous self-administration of drugs of abuse. The self-administration capabilities are critical for experiments we have planned in the immediate future. Also, the lab already has 16 Med Associates boxes and we would like to keep all of our data consistent. The lab already has computers that interface with Med Associates equipment. Adding different vendors may introduce a wild element to an experiment such as: a different resistance for a level press, certain odor we can't sense but an animal can and adding a different way to program the boxes adds complexity to a worker's task which may lead to errors. <br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of the 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however, all responses received, within 10 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. <br />The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer. The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions applies to this acquisition. The offeror must include their Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. The clauses are available in full text at http://www.acquisition.gov/far. Interested vendors capable of furnishing the government with the service specified in this synopsis should submit one (1) copy of their quotation to the below address or via email to robinsti@mail.nih.gov by the due date and time below.

The proposed contract is in support of the Crack Resistant Concrete Repair Material Demonstration/Validation Project.   The objective of the crack resistant concrete repair material project is to further the development of a unique repair material and demonstrate its use under full scale production processes.
  The production of this material requires the use of state-of-the-art materials including a modified elastomer crumb rubber.  The NAVFAC Engineering Service Center (NAVFAC ESC) has worked with a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) partner (MER) for the last six years on phases I & II of a project to develop this Crack Resistant Durable Repair Material (Navy Contract No. N00014-07-C-0390).  Vaycon Consulting was retained by MER during this time as a subcontractor to provide them with subject matter expert level engineering services and technical consultation regarding the development of the repair material.  The unique and highly specialized engineering knowledge that Vaycon Consulting has acquired by being a part of the prior SBIR work ensures that the crack resistant repairs completed under this project will function as designed.
  The material is to be demonstrated on a Navy fueling pier and a premature failure of the repair material would translate to increased maintenance costs and a decrease in military operational capability of the pier.  Utilizing other incapable sources is not operationally or monetarily feasible and unacceptably increases risk.  Therefore, the Government can only acquire these services from Vaycon Consulting on a sole source basis.  (See Attached Sole Source Justification.)   

Statement of Work
1.	Project Title:
Crack Resistant Concrete Repairs Technical Consultation
2.	Background:  
Conventional repair materials typically crack in a short time (a few months), thus setting the stage for premature failure by allowing the rapid ingress of water, air and chlorides to reach the steel reinforcement.
  Throughout the DoD (and industry wide) conventional repairs are estimated to last just 5 to 7 years.  The NAVFAC Engineering Service Center (NAVFAC ESC) has worked with a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) partner (MER/Conproco) for the last six years on a project costing $1.85 million to develop a Crack Resistant Durable Repair Material under Navy Contract No. N00014-07-C-0390.  The final (Phase II) report was completed in February 2010.   The resultant pre-bagged concrete repair material has been successfully demonstrated at NAVFAC ESCs Advanced Waterfront Technology Test Site (AWTTS) as being crack free after one-year exposure.  The approach taken in the development of this material was to include recycled rubber that is bonded to the cement paste so as to relieve internal stresses that often result in cracking.
  The material properties and characteristics were evaluated through a comprehensive laboratory testing program conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the American Concrete Institute 364.3R, Guide for Cementitious Material Data Sheet.  The final product is unique in that it contains crumb rubber, fly ash and silica fume; all of which are recycled industrial by-products, and thus it is a step towards using greener materials with lower life cycle costs.
NAVFAC ESC has been funded by the Office of the Secretary of Defense Corrosion Prevention and Control Program (OSD) to demonstrate and validate the use of crack resistant concrete repair materials under full-scale construction processes on Navy concrete repair projects.
  NAVFAC ESC currently has a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) in place with Conproco to transition the repair material into widespread usage in the Navy and throughout the DoD.

<p>Notice for Filing Agency Protests</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>1.0 GENERAL.</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />The Government has a requirement for an engine dynamometer and associated equipment for the MTU 20V4000M93L Main Diesel Engine (MDE). In preparation to meet the training requirements for the new USCG Fast Response Cutter (FRC), the United States Coast Guard (USCG) desires to purchase an engine dynamometer and associated equipment to operate the previously procured MTU 20V4000M93L MDE and the electronic controls as installed on the FRC. Additionally, this training engine shall be operated at the full rated speed of 2100 rpm and load of 4300kW. The engine dynamometer and associated equipment will be used in the training program that directly supports maintenance and operations of the installed MDEs installed aboard Coast Guard WPC class of cutters. The engine dynamometer and associated equipment shall be delivered to USCG Training Center (TRACEN) Yorktown, VA.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is a military, multi-mission, maritime service within the Department of Homeland Security and one of the nation's five armed services. Its core roles are to protect the public, the environment, and U.S. economic and security interests in any maritime region in which those interests may be at risk, including international waters and America's coasts, ports, and inland waterways.</p>
<p>The USCG has made a conscious effort within the last few years to determine the most appropriate, cost effective solutions to workforce performance problems, while simultaneously optimizing the current training infrastructure to meet operational and logistical demands. The USCG currently relies heavily on contracted training for the maintenance, operation, and troubleshooting of MTU propulsion machinery and electronic controls on the WPC class cutter. The USCG training program management office (FC-Tms) has worked to garner the resources necessary to lessen the reliance on contracted training. The USCG has determined that TRACEN Yorktown's engineering and Weapons (T-ew) facility will be the future site to train operators and maintainers of this equipment. A significant T-ew facilities renovation is planned to start in the next in 2012 and will include the construction of a new building intended to house the WPC/FRC training aids, laboratories, and classrooms to create a Land-Based Training Facility (LBTF). This engine dynamometer and associated equipment procured by this contract shall be stored at the LBTF.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS (IF &gt;$25K)</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>The contractor shall provide the following services on a firm-fixed price basis: All personnel, equipment, tools, supervision, and other items and services necessary to ensure that grounds maintenance is performed at Rome Research Site in a manner that will maintain healthy grass, trees, shrubs, and plants, and present a clean, neat, and professional appearance in accordance with the attached Performance Work Statement dated 14 March 2012. The area to be maintained is approximately 45 acres.</p>
<p>OFFERORS MUST USE ATTACHED BID SCHEDULE TO INPUT BASE AND OPTION YEAR PRICES.</p>
<p>NOTE that the Government will not provide utilities such as water during contract performance. The Contractor will be responsible for furnishing all utilities and equipment necessary to perform the work. There will also be no staging of equipment or supplies on government property.</p>
<p>The base year period of performance is 01 May 2012 through 30 April 2013. The government contemplates awarding a contract with one base year plus four option years. If all options are exercised, performance under this contract will conclude on 30 April 2017. The place of performance is Air Force Research Laboratory/Rome Research Site, Rome, NY 13441.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal SITE VISIT will be conducted at 8:00 AM (EST) on MONDAY 2 APRIL 2012. Contact Bryant Soule, Contract Specialist (315-330-4723 or bryant.soule@rl.af.mil), no later than 3:00 PM (EST) on FRIDAY 30 MARCH 2012 to ensure site access. All attending parties must be identified so security forms and gate clearances can be processed.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (FEB 2012), applies to this acquisition. Addenda to the following paragraphs of 52.212-1 are:</p>
<p>(b) Written proposals are due by 3:00 PM (EST) on 11 April 2012. Submit to: AFRL/RIKO, Attn: Bryant Soule, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514 or by facsimile to: 315-330-2555 or by email to bryant.soule@rl.af.mil.</p>
<p>(b)(10) The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offerors' performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this RFP. Offerors shall submit past performance information to include recent and relevant contracts which demonstrate the ability of the offeror to perform the proposed effort. Please provide past performance information for no more than five (5) relevant contracts performed for Government agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years. To the maximum extent practicable, identify contracts for properties which are not owned or operated by your firm or by key personnel, including intended subcontractors, of your firm. <br />Referenced past performance information should include contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers, and a narrative explaining the contract's relevancy to the solicitation.</p>
<p>To be considered RELEVANT, performance must meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; Contract efforts that required mowing, edging, trimming, pruning, policing, and leaf removal of a lawn area at least 10 acres in size.</p>
<p>(k) Central Contractor Registration. Offerors must be registered in the CCR database to receive a contract award. If the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database within four (4) days after receiving notification from the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered offeror. Information may be obtained at http://www.ccr.gov or 888-227-2423.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) applies. In addition to the information in paragraph (a), the following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) PRICE and (ii) PAST PERFORMANCE. After considering all past performance data gathered by the Government for this solicitation, an offeror's past performance will be assigned a confidence rating based on the list below:</p>
<p>-Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>Past performance regarding predecessor companies, personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history, or a performance record that is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance assessment, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p><br />The representations and certifications in the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2012) and Alternate I (APR 2011) must be completed electronically on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bpn.gov.

Unreasonably low or high proposed prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition.<br> Total Evaluated Price - The total evaluated price to be used for the determination of reasonableness will be calculated as follows:  <br>(i).The evaluated price for each CLIN is the unit price proposed for the CLIN multiplied by the quantity specified in the Schedule for that CLIN.   <br>(ii).

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p>The lab at NIH has several chambers and equipment from Med Associates and in order to maintain compatibility and reduce variables it is best not to have boxes and chambers from multiple vendors. Med Associates boxes are the only known boxes that allow for multiple modes of drug-delivery to the animals and give flexibility such as the boxes allow for duel self-administration capabilities, including oral and intravenous self-administration of drugs of abuse. The self-administration capabilities are critical for experiments we have planned in the immediate future. Also, the lab already has 16 Med Associates boxes and we would like to keep all of our data consistent. The lab already has computers that interface with Med Associates equipment. Adding different vendors may introduce a wild element to an experiment such as: a different resistance for a level press, certain odor we can't sense but an animal can and adding a different way to program the boxes adds complexity to a worker's task which may lead to errors. <br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of the 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302.

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amendment 0003:</span></strong><br />Please see attached Amendment 0003.&nbsp; The purpose of Amendment 0003 is to&nbsp;incorporate&nbsp;clause 52.227-3 by reference to RFP Section I.1 All other terms and conditions of HSTS04-12-R-CT2011 remain unchanged.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amendment 0002:<br /><br /></span></strong>Please see attached Amendment 0002.&nbsp; The purpose of Amendment 0002 is to replace Solicitation HSTS04-12-R-CT2011 RFP to reflect changes outlined on the attached SF-30, replace Attachment J.1 - CDRLs and DIDs in its entirety, replace Attachment J.2 - AIT-2 Functional Requirements Document to updated Version 2.1 dated 08 March 2012 (Please note this document is SSI and is available upon request to those potential offerors who have been approved to receive SSI under this solicitation), replace Attachment J.3 - Price Evaluation Template, provide Government responses to questions received in response to this solicitation via Question Tracker dated 16 March 2012 (Please note this document is SSI and is available upon request to those potential offerors who have been approved to receive SSI under this solicitation), and provide a copy of the Pre-Solicitation Conference Presentation given on 09 March 2012 (Please note this document is SSI and&nbsp;is available&nbsp;to those potential offerors who have been cleared to receive SSI under this solicitation).&nbsp; All other terms and conditions of HSTS04-12-R-CT2011 remain unchanged.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amendment 0001:<br /></span></strong><br />Please see attached Amendment 0001.&nbsp; The purpose of Amendment 0001 is to replace&nbsp;Attachment J.6 - Self-Certification Checklist&nbsp;in its&nbsp;entirety, removing SSI and converting it to an Excel template; to update the RFP Section J to indicate that Attachment J.6 is no longer considered SSI; and to update Section L to reflect a change in the page limit from 20 pages to 10 pages for the written submission of Volume I: Technical Factor as well as to clarify that substantiation attachments are not included in the 10 page&nbsp;count&nbsp;rather than in the 20 page count.<br /><br />Additionally, any foreign national contractor employees cleared for access to SSI under this Solicitation and interested in attending the Pre-Solicitation Conference should provide notice of that intent as soon as possible. This is because the process for accessing the TSIF is different and takes longer for foreign nations than for US citizens.<br /><br />Please note that the title "draft" of the document package of the original Combined Synopsis/Solicitation posted on 21 February 2012 was a computer error and that those documents are in fact final documents for this Solicitation.To avoid further confusion, all of those documents have been reposted in the new document package of Amendment 0001 without change.&nbsp; Additionally, Attachment J.6 - Self-Certification is also now available in that document package.<br /><br /><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Synopsis:<br /><br /></strong></span></span>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to procure second-generation AIT systems (AIT-2).&nbsp;&nbsp;The AIT-2 system provides Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) additional threat detection capabilities to locate potential threats concealed from view on a passenger. The AIT-2 system detects metallic and non-metallic anomalies such as weapons, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) components and plastic threats. Reduced-sized systems will provide an alternative to full-size systems to help reduce the AIT-2s overall footprint for smaller checkpoint configurations. &nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SSI:<br /></strong></span><br />Portions of this RFP contain Sensitive Security Information (SSI).&nbsp; All&nbsp;Contractors&nbsp;interested in responding to the AIT-2 solicitation must go through a vetting process and be approved to have access to SSI.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Contractors who have been successfully vetted under the Pre-Solicitation Notice instructions will have SSI sent to the given Senior Corporate Official e-mail address.&nbsp; <br /><br />Contractors that have not been vetted under the Pre-Solicitation Notice and are interested in responding to the AIT-2 solicitation should review the SSI Clearance Information <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within the attached RFP document</span>&nbsp;and respond as appropriate.&nbsp; Please note that the clearance process can take several weeks.<br /><br />Contractors&nbsp;that submit SSI vetting information prior to the deadline&nbsp;within the attached RFP document should receive correspondence from TSA by March 19, 2012 5:00 PM EST.&nbsp; Please e-mail the Primary and Secondary Point of Contact in this Solicitation Notice if a submission was made&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;the deadline in&nbsp;attached RFP document and the March 19, 2012&nbsp;date passes.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CNSI:<br /><br /></strong></span>Portions of this RFP contain Classified National Security Information (CNSI).&nbsp; Contractors must have a facility clearance (FCL) at the Secret level and a DD Form 254 from the Government.&nbsp; The Government will use the Contractor's CAGE code to determine the Contractor's FCL status.&nbsp; Only after receipt of DD Form 254 with appropriate FCL status will Contractors be&nbsp;provided (by mail)&nbsp;the related CNSI information.&nbsp; <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Pre-Solicitation Conference:<br /><br /></span></strong>An AIT-2 Pre-Solicitation Conference&nbsp;will be held on March 9, 2012 from 8:30 am to 12 noon at the TSA Systems Integration Facility (TSIF) in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;In order to attend, Contractors must be vetted and approved to have access to SSI because SSI will be presented at the Pre-Solicitation Conference.<br /><br />Those Contractors interested in attending the AIT-2 Pre-Solicitation Conference that have not been vetted under the&nbsp;Pre-Solicitation Notice should review the SSI Clearance Information <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within the attached RFP document</span> and respond as appropriate immediately in order to permit the initiation of the clearance process.&nbsp; Please note that&nbsp;while a best effort will be undertaken to complete the process, TSA does not guarantee completion of the clearance process, nor does TSA guarantee access to the AIT-2 Pre-Solicitation Conference for any Contractor which did not complete vetting and receive approval for access to SSI under the Pre-Solicitation Notice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Once approved for access to SSI, and no later than March 1, 2012, Contractors should provide the Primary and Secondary Point of Contact in this Solicitation Notice the names and phone numbers of no more than&nbsp;two (2)&nbsp;individuals cleared for access to SSI that plan on attending the AIT-2 Pre-Solicitation Conference.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>NOTE:&nbsp; All information above is considered the Solicitation Notice.&nbsp; All information below is considered the Pre-Solicitation Notice.<br /><br /></strong>Added: Dec 09, 2011 1:31 pm <br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), intends to compete its requirement for a second generation of Advanced Imaging Technology-2 (AIT-2). The AIT-2 system is used as a primary screening device to inspect a passenger's body for concealed weapons (metal and non-metal), explosives and other prohibited items. AIT takes into account passenger privacy considerations and employs safeguards to provide the maximum level of privacy protection to passengers. AIT is being upgraded to include Automated Target Recognition (ATR) capability which reduces privacy concerns and decreases passenger processing time. AIT-2 may also serve as a platform for potential integration of metal detection and/or shoe scanning capability.</p>

The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued on this same FedBizOps webpage, with the exception of certain RFP attachments which are considered either Sensitive Security Information (SSI) or Classified National Security Information (CNSI).

The system will monitor and control outside air ventilation, lighting systems, electrical heat tracing on water and sewage lines, interior and exterior steam traps, building temperatures, and heating water temperatures. Control action will be limited to selected facilities and include a central control station, substations, fiber optic communications net, field interface devices, and necessary mechanical and electrical modifications to existing equipment. The facilities at Thule Air Base do not benefit from available modern technology for monitoring and control. Excessive repair costs are incurred when buildings in unoccupied periods freeze up unnoticed due to heating system failure or when water and sewage lines freeze up due to failing electrical heat tracing. During unoccupied periods, energy is wasted unnecessarily in buildings for outside air ventilation, lighting, and heating. Energy is lost unnoticed through failing steam traps in spite of excessive Recurring Work Program costs to maintain the traps. An excessive amount of energy is wasted from overheated buildings due to deficient temperature controls.</span></p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to the New York Sleep Institute,&nbsp;724&nbsp;Second Avenue, New York, NY 10016 for the analyses of modified polysomnograms obtained from NIMH's cohort of children with autism. The New York&nbsp;Sleep Institute will (1) examine polysomnography for sleep stages I-IV (N1-N3), REM percentage as a fraction of total sleep time, and latencies to particular stages, sleep efficiency and other parameters of the sleep/wake cycle, (2) use standard GRASS telefactor software to calculate sleep staging and (3) read studies in parallel with Program to achieve rater reliability.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the work is to be conducted at the New York&nbsp; Sleep Institute, which is well equipped to provide the tools to allow the experts to properly analyze such data.&nbsp; The New York Sleep Institute has an expert, Dr. Alcibiades Rodriguez, which is fellowship trained in neurology, epilepsy and sleep and is a practicing clinician in sleep disorders. Correct analyses of sleep data on children with autism and possibly epileptic abnormalities can be quite challenging and is best done by neurologists who have formal sleep and epilepsy training and extensive experience in reading such studies. Dr. Rodriguez works closely with NYU's epilepsy center and he is familiar with the neurophysiology of persons with autism and developmental disabilities. He has consistently provided NIMH with high quality analyses of their pediatric polysomnograms over the last several years. Dr. Rodriguez is currently in the process of reading the follow-up polysmnographic examinations from NIMH's ongoing, longitudinal study of sleep in three cohorts of young children. These re-reads must be done by the same reader to ensure that there is continuity in testing and consistency in coding across the entire study sample. In addition, analysis of these samples must be done by the appropriate laboratory.&nbsp; Analyses performed via this contract will allow researchers in the Pediatrics &amp; Developmental Neurosciences Branch to accomplish the goals of several clinical research protocols in various stages of development.</p>
<p>The period of performance is 12 months with option(s) for up to four additional one-year periods.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures using FAR 12 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by submitting a statement of capabilities on or before 10:00 AM E.T., March 30, 2012 to Korriise LaRoche, larochek@mail.nih.gov. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NIMH to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA, the vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, the vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at ww.ccr.gov. Please reference announcement number NOI-2370900 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC><p>The Export-Import Bank of the U.S. (Ex-Im Bank) intends&nbsp;to include gymnasium/health club memberships as part of its health and wellness initiative for its employees.&nbsp; The Ex-Im Bank is soliciting gymnasium and health clubs which meet the criteria described herein.&nbsp; The Ex-Im Bank intends to cover half of the monthly membership fee for each participating employee joining a gymnasium/health club selected by Ex-Im Bank.&nbsp; Participating gymnasiums and health clubs must obtain payment for the remaining monthly amount due directly from the Ex-Im Bank employees.<br /><br />The Ex-Im Bank is a federal agency and uses the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)&nbsp;in conducting procurements. In fulfilling this procurement, the Ex-Im Bank&nbsp;is utilizing the commercial buy procedures at FAR Part 12 and the simplified acquisition procedures at FAR Part 13. To implement the gymnasium/health club membership program for its employees, the Ex-Im Bank intends to establish annual Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with qualified&nbsp;facilities.&nbsp;The&nbsp;maximum value of any BPA shall not exceed $100,000 per annum.&nbsp; More than one BPA may be awarded to serve the Ex-Im Bank employee population per office location.<br /><br />The number of Ex-Im Bank employees who may choose to participate in the gymnasium/health club program at any particular location is uncertain. The majority of Ex-Im Bank employees are assigned to the headquarters office in Washington, DC, with a far smaller number of employees assigned to regional office locations. The addresses for existing office locations are as follows:<br /><br />811 Vermont Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20571<br /><br />33 Whitehall Street, New York, NY 10004<br /><br />200 West Adams Street, Chicago, IL 60606<br /><br />5835 Blue Lagoon Drive, Miami, FL 33126<br /><br />1880 South Dairy Ashford II, Houston, TX 77077<br /><br />McKinney Chamber of Commerce, Summit Park I<br />2150 S. Central Expressway, Dalla, TX 75069<br /><br />2302 Martin Court, Irvine, CA 92612&nbsp;<br /><br />9449 Balboa Avenue, San Diego, CA 92123<br /><br />50 Freemont Street, San Francisco, CA 94105<br /><br />New regional offices are scheduled to come on line during the year at the following locations: Atlanta, GA; Detroit, MI; Minneapolis, MN and Seattle, WA. Exact street addresses have not yet been determined.<br /><br />The Ex-Im Bank intends to make BPA awards based on best value. Best value involves a tradeoff between technical considerations and price. The technical criteria (non-price factors) to be used in determining qualified facilities, in descending order of importance are as follows:<br /><br />&nbsp; -&nbsp; Within a half mile (.5) radius or ten minute commute from the workplace;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp; Ability to invoice&nbsp;the individual participant directly for one half of the&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monthly fee and invoice the Ex-Im Bank in a consolidated statement for&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;remaining amount(s) due for all participating employees;<br /><br />&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;As members, Ex-Im Bank employees shall have full access to facilities&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;be provided services including but not limited to: state of the art <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equipment (i.e. cardiovascular, strength and free weight conditioning <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equipment); aerobic and cycling exercise equipment; the availability of a <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knowledgeable support staff to provide weight management and health <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maintenance guidance as requested;separate showers/locker rooms for <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each gender; on-site classes and personal training (i.e. Pilates, Yoga, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dance, Step etc.); fitness consultations/life style programs; orientation for&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the various types of equipment as requested; towel service for showering&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and workouts;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Positive track record of past performance (clean and well maintained&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facilities and equipment, knowledgeable and courteous staff, timely and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accurate invoicing).<br /><br />As technical merit among qualified facilities becomes more equal, price becomes more important in vendor selection.&nbsp; While a best value award allows for the possibility for making an award to other than the lowest priced offer, the lowest priced offer among technically acceptable facilities may also represent the best value.<br /><br />The applicable North American Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 713940 with a small business size standard of $7.0 million in average annual receipts.&nbsp; Because geographic proximity to the workplace is a primary consideration, the Ex-Im Bank is conducting this procurement on a unrestricted&nbsp;basis.&nbsp; All other things being equal among competing facilities eligible to serve a specific Ex-Im Bank&nbsp;office population, preference for award shall be to small businesses.<br /><br />Vendors interested in being considered for participation in this requirement must complete the attachments to this notice and provide them to the attention of Mr. Roderic Collins at roderic.collins@exim.gov.<br /><br />The deadline for submission of responses is 12:00 PM (EST) June 29, 2012. The timing of BPA awards will be driven by employee demand per location and awards will be made up until the point where the office locations to be served are considered to provide a sufficient variety of fitness facility options for the Ex-Im Bank employees.<br /><br />As they are awarded, the BPAs will be posted at <a href="http://www.exim.gov/about/contracting.cfm">http://www.exim.gov/about/contracting.cfm</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This BPA announcement will be repeated annually.&nbsp; BPAs shall be awarded on an annual basis.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The solicitation# for this effort is hereby changed from&nbsp;EXIM-12-A-0002 to EXIM-12-Q-0034.<br />&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, PMA 257 awarded a Sole-Source delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement <br />N00019-12-G-0002-1001 to Rolls Royce, PLC, Bristol, England, for a Component Improvement Program (CIP) for the AV-8B F-402 Pegasus propulsion system pursuant to the authority provided in FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The F402 Pegasus Propulsion System is used in the USMC AV-8B Aircraft as well as in British, Spanish and Italian AV-8B variants. The CIP will apply to all of the aircraft.
<p>Rolls Royce is the original designer, developer and manufacturer of the F402 (AV-8B) series engine and is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience and technical expertise to continue to provide the required supplies and services. Rolls Royce is the only source with the technical data, facilities and capabilities required to provide the associated system and sustainment support for the F402 (AV-8B) series engine requirements. Rolls-Royce maintains configuration control over the F402 engine and will not provide unlimited rights to the Government. No other manufacturer could design, develop and properly integrate F402 engine upgrades to meet the contract delivery schedules required to resolve issues in the fleet with the current configuration. Rolls Royce was selected as the prime contractor for the original engine development resulting from full and open competition.</p>
<p>Under the proposed contract, Rolls Royce shall provide engineering and support services to maintain the system's effectiveness and optimize the affordable readiness of the AV-8B F-402 propulsion system. Specifically, the contractor shall perform engineering projects and provide design solutions to provide for continuing improvements in Safety, Readiness, Reliability, Maintainability, Sustainment, and correction of service related non-specification deficiencies. The period of performance is 01 March 2012 through 31 December 2012.</p>

The mission's strategic HIV MMC Program, in line with the overall national HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan for South Africa, 2007-2011, has the following strategic objectives:<br />1. To provide high quality, high volume, high efficiency, voluntary MMC services in KwaZulu Natal, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, and Free State provinces to approximately 125,000 males aged 15-49 by building on existing USAID-supported MMC sites; and<br />2. To provide technical assistance to provinces and districts to ensure successful start-up of well placed, high volume, high quality government MMC sites that can be sustained through public funding.</p>

<FOJA>Follow-on Delivery Order Following Competitive Initial Order
<AWDNBR>GS-23F-0341N
<DONBR>ED-FSA-12-D-XXXX
<DESC>Consistent with FAR Subpart 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C), FSA's requirement for awarding the task order as a follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order is permitted so long as the original task order was awarded under Federal Supply Schedule procedures and it was not issued under sole source or limited source procedures.
<p><br />The original task order was competitively awarded under Federal Supply Schedule procedures and it was not issued under sole source or limited source procedures. Accordingly, the award of this task order as a logical follow on is permissible under the Federal Acquisition Regulations.</p>
<p><br />Consistent with the agency's existing collection agreements, this task order shall be a performance-based, firm-fixed price order in accordance with the terms and conditions of GSA Schedule GS-23F-0341N. The period of performance for this effort shall be from April 1, 2012 through September 30, 2012 with an estimated value of $1,000,000.00.</p>
<p><br />In order to close CollectCorp' s contract FSA must be able to ensure that all invoices have been properly paid and that all accounts are recalled from the contractor. At this time, the Government is unable to confirm the accuracy of the debt collection system's ability to perform either of these tasks. In order to minimize the impact on the borrowers, it is FSA intention to authorize CollectCorp to keep working with the borrowers on their system until both of these functions have been validated as accurate. Consequently, the accounts cannot be properly transferred to another servicer until the debt collection system is able to perform the recall and invoice functions.</p>
