<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price maintenance agreement contract to Caliper Life Sciences, Inc., 68 Elm Street, Hopkinton, MA 01748. The contract shall be for a base year of 12 months with 4 option years of 12 months each. <br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c) (1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. <br />Caliper Life Sciences is the sole manufacturer of the Caliper Life laboratory instruments that is needed to be maintained. The Division of Laboratory Sciences utilizes a variety of&nbsp;i1000 Twister robots and&nbsp;Zephyr Liquid Handler&nbsp;from Caliper Life&nbsp;to accomplish its public health mission. These&nbsp;Robots/Handlers are utilized to perform critical chemical analyses in support of&nbsp;its public health mission and in research and development to establish new analytic methods. These instruments are used in mission critical research projects and analyses for a broad variety of sample types on a wide ranch of mission critical projects, and it is crucial that they are not allowed to be off of a service agreement for any period of time. <br />The service engineers with Caliper Life&nbsp;are highly experienced with the equipment itself and with understanding the critical requirements in place due to our division's emergency response duties. Additionally their engineers have been factory trained and certified for repairs and maintenance of Caliper Life&nbsp;robots/handlers as well as being experts in the repair of related instruments. Caliper sells these items as part of their&nbsp;robot/handler systems and can offer service at competitive rates.
<p>Caliper has proven to be knowledgeable, reliable, and efficient regarding installation, repair, and maintenance of their&nbsp;robots/handlers and the associated equipment. Additionally, Caliper is clearly able to communicate on the status of equipment maintenance and repair projects. Their field service representatives provided prompt responses to all CDC needs. Caliper provides on-site, dedicated engineers so that response is virtually immediate. They also maintained an on-site inventory of replacement parts and equipment so that in the case of instrument failures repair and service requests require the least amount of time possible.</p>
<p>No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to Caliper Life. CDC believes that Caliper Life Sciences&nbsp;is the only source available to provide this service that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Richard Jenkins via email to <a href="mailto:rbj3@cdc.gov">rbj3@cdc.gov</a>&nbsp;using solicitation number 2012-N-14269 in the subject line, no later than 11:00 am Eastern Time,&nbsp;19 March 2012.</p>
