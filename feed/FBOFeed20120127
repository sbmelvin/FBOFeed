<DESC>The U. S. Army Contracting Command, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of Product Manager AIR WARRIOR has a requirement for rapid, collaborative development and fabrication of a lightweight, surface immersion, thermally protective garment for military aviators.  This requirement also includes an option for Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) of the developed garment.<br><br>The LISA procurement supports the Air Soldier System (AirSS) program.  AirSS is the next-generation aircrew mission and protective ensemble that will replace the legacy Air Warrior system currently in use by Army rotary and fixed wing aircrew.  A Key Performance Parameter of the AirSS is to provide a reduction in weight and bulk of 25 - 40% over the current Air Warrior system.  Reductions in bulk and weight will be balanced against cost and soldier effectiveness.  The engineering strategy for the LISA is collaborative Contractor/Government design modification of a commercial/non-developmental item (as represented by the Contractor's bid sample) to maximize reductions in weight and bulk while meeting at least the threshold immersed thermal protection requirement of 2 hours in 45 deg F seas (sea state of 5).  The scope of this effort includes: design collaboration with the Government; limited support to Government-conducted program management, systems engineering, and test and evaluation; fabrication of mockups, functional prototypes, and production representative prototypes; refurbishment and modification of prototypes; delivery of technical data; and travel. <br><br>The LISA EMD will consist of an 18 - 20 month design and evaluation phase at the end of which production-representative garment prototypes will be used in the Government Developmental Test/Operational Test (DT/OT) for the Air SS Phase 1a. The LRIP option may be exercised after the DT/OT phase and would be used to support fielding and the Air SS Phase 1b DT/OT.  LRIP units will be subject to compliance with the Berry Amendment and Buy America Act.<br><br>The Request For Proposals (RFP) shall require the Offeror to submit information demonstrating that their bid sample exhibits the minimum specified performance for the following attributes: weight, packed volume, water ingress during swimming, immersed insulation, and maximum escape buoyancy.  The Offeror shall cite, reference and attach any supporting test data.  To evaluate whether the bid sample meets the minimum performance for the basic performance attributes, the Government will examine Offeror-submitted bid sample information.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to conduct testing of Offeror-provided bid samples.<br><br>This procurement is 100% set-aside for small business concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 315999, and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  The award will be a combined Cost Plus Fixed Fee and Firm Fixed Price contract. The Government envisions that only one award will be made, however, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award or no awards and to award without discussions at their discretion.  If for any reason, there are no successful proposals, or a single successful proposal, the Government reserves the right to re-open the solicitation.<br><br>FAR 52-232-33 (Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer Central Contractor Registration, May 1999) shall be a mandatory requirement for contractors to be registered in the CCR database. Contractors may register on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br><br>The Government currently estimates that the RFP will be released within the next twenty-one (21) days, on or about 17 February 2012, and proposals will be due approximately thirty (30) days after the release of the RFP.<br><br>Any questions regarding this requirement will be accepted in writing only to Christine Sordillo at christine.sordillo@us.army.mil.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SYNOPSISELECTRICAL UPGRADE AND GATE ACTUATOR REPLACEMENT MEDICINE DAM, MONTANA
1.0	BACKGROUND:
1.1	The Bureau of Reclamation-Technical Service Center (BOR), located in Denver, Colorado, is assisting the Bureau of Indian Affairs-Rocky Mountain Region (BIA) with work related to the electrical service upgrade and gate actuator replacement for Lower Two Medicine Dam, which is located approximately 7 miles northwest of East Glacier Park, Montana (see Figure 1 and 2).  The four existing Rotork IQS35Z slide gate actuators, 2 regulating (downstream) and 2 emergencies (upstream) do not provide enough torque to properly and safely operate the gates at the design operating head of 40-feet.  These four existing actuators (see attached Figures 3 and 4) utilize single-phase motors and do not develop adequate torque for the design operating head of 40-feet.
1.2	In order to obtain actuators which are rated for the full design operating head, a three-phase motor actuator will be needed.  The incoming power to the Lower Two Medicine Dam gate house shall be modified to a three-phase power source to accommodate the installation and safe operation of the new higher torque actuators.
2.0	SCOPE:  The principal components of work required are described below.  Design and drawings will be provided by BOR.
2.1	Electrical Service Upgrade:  Three-phase power has been extended by the local electrical co-operative to a pole located approximately 150 feet from the Lower Two Medicine Dam gate house.  The contractor shall extend the three-phase power to the gate house by running underground with conduit which contains incoming power conductors. The existing single phase power shall remain active during most of the electrical upgrades within the building.  The three-phase conversion shall happen when three-phase power is brought into the site and when single-phase equipment must be removed to accommodate the new three-phase power installation.
2.1.1	The contractor shall remove the existing 240/120 volt single-phase service and associated service equipment, and provide new 480 volt three-phase service.  Equipment consisting of meter socket, service disconnect switch, and manual transfer switch.
2.1.2	The contractor shall provide a complete electrical system for the new 480 volt distribution system and new slide gate motor actuators consisting of; distribution panel board, transformer and load center, grounding and bonding, conductors and cables, conduit systems, and providing all electrical drawings and data required in the "Section" attachments included with this statement of work.
2.1.3	The contractor shall minimize interruption to the existing 240 volt power supply to the existing gate actuators when converting the existing 120/240 volt single-phase service over to the new 480 volt, three-phase power service.  The existing gates shall remain operational until the new gate actuators arrive on site and an outage is granted.  All conduit and wiring associated with the new 480 volt power supply for the new gate actuators shall be in place and ready for final connection prior to removing the existing gate actuators.
2.2	Mechanical Equipment:  The contractor shall remove the four existing slide gate motor operator lifts and provide four new slide gate motor operator lifts and appurtenant equipment; and provide all mechanical drawings and data required in the "Section" attachments included with this SOW.

<SUBJECT>Southwest Border Transportation, Medical Escort and Guard Services
<SOLNBR>HSBP1012R0020
<CONTACT>Shaun G Saad, Phone 202-344-1971, Email Shaun.Saad@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to procure commercial services for secure transportation of detainees, medical escort, and facilities guard services to augment Agents and Officers performing law enforcement duties at and along the Southwest Border. In 2011, CBP apprehensions along the Southwest Border averaged 897 detainees per day that required transportation and guard services. CBP projects a continued requirement for approximately 450,000 hours of vehicle operational hours and 735,000 hours of labor operational hours over the course of each year to transport and guard the illegal aliens from their points of apprehension until they are either returned to their country of origin for repatriation or transferred to another agency for long-term detention. CBP lacks sufficient personnel and vehicular resources to support this requirement without impacting higher priority border security missions.
<p>CBP will utilize Full and Open competition under NAICS code 561612 and in accordance with FAR Part 15 for a resulting performance-based indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) hybrid type contract for a term of 5 years (one 12 month Base Period and four 12 month Option Periods). The solicitation will include a mix of Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Time and Material (T&amp;M) and Cost Reimbursable (CR) line items.</p>
<p>The scope of the requirement is for services of trained and certified security officers to operate vehicles along the Southwest Border in the transportation of detainees. Transportation services shall be provided by contractors (Transportation Officers) that have a Commercial Driver License (CDL) and can multi-task as both a driver on a detainee transport vehicle and as a facility or medical escort guard. When not driving, a Transportation Officer may be tasked to perform ad hoc guard functions at a facility or medical establishment. Facility/Medical escort services can also be performed by qualified contractor guards that do not require CDL; however, without a CDL, those contractors may not perform as a Transportation Officer. The government will not provide GFP. The contractor will be responsible for providing a full service solution. The resulting contract will provide efficient, flexible, responsive, safe and secure operations in a variety of circumstances, such as the following:</p>
<p>&bull; The gender, physical health, and risk associated with detainees will vary.<br />&bull; Apprehension locations and the number of illegal aliens apprehended per event and over time will vary.<br />&bull; Transports will frequently occur in a harsh and isolated environment.</p>
<p>An award will be made on a Best Value basis to the offeror who proposes a solution that is in the best interest of the Government. Performance requirements will be established that include but are not limited to the following areas:</p>
<p>- Operational Efficiency <br />- Operational Flexibility <br />- Operational Responsiveness <br />- Safety and Security</p>
<p>The operational area covers four states (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas) and nine (9) Southwest Border Sectors. Each CBP Sector is unique and has varying requirements, as follows:</p>
<p>- Del Rio<br />- El Centro<br />- El Paso<br />- Laredo<br />- Big Bend<br />- Rio Grande<br />- San Diego<br />- Tucson<br />- Yuma</p>
<p><br />All comments concerning this pre-solicitation announcement are to be provided in writing to the attention of Shaun G. Saad, via e-mail to shaun.saad@dhs.gov</p>

DHAPP has successfully engaged over 80 countries in efforts to combat HIV/AIDS among their respective military services.
  DHAPP is a partner U. S. Government (USG) organization collaborating with the U.S. State Department, Health and Human Services, US Agency for International Development, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  Working closely with U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, university collaborators, and other nongovernmental organizations, DHAPP assists countries in establishing HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs and/or strengthening their capabilities to combat HIV.  

This BAA allows DHAPP to assist countries where militaries are not funded under PEPFAR.
 

DHAPP's goal is to maximize program impact by focusing on the drivers of the epidemic specific to the military, and to support the development of interventions and programs that address these issues.  DHAPP works with countries militaries to devise plans based on the following process:

	Meet with key partners in country to determine provisional major program areas and other technical assistance needs. 
	Adapt DHAPP support to a countrys need for prevention, care and/or treatment of their HIV/AIDS situation based on an assessment of the countrys epidemic, and more specifically, in that countrys military. 
	Strengthen the military capacity for ownership and behavioral changes over the long term.
 
	Consider program design by leveraging assets with other country partners who have/had successful prevention, care, and/or treatment efforts. 
	Focus on prevention, care and/or treatment impact aligned with national implementation plans. 
	Implement and monitor programs to ensure accountability and sustainability. 

Countries and their militaries need strong programs with courses of action that demonstrate: 

	Visible support from the military sector. 
	Development of plans of action and policies. 
	Alignment with PEPFAR, as well as national, strategies and priorities.
	Increasing awareness within the military sector. 
	Country military ownership of its activities. 
	Prevention plans focusing on prevention of sexual transmission through voluntary counseling and testing, sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention and management, behavioral interventions, reduction of concurrent partnerships, prevention and care of opportunistic infections, male circumcision, changing male normative behaviors, and prevention campaigns.
 
	Reduction of mother-to-child transmission, (The primary focus of these interventions is on behavior change to reduce the risks of sexual transmission, counseling, testing, diagnosis and proper linkages to care and support).
	Stigma reduction associated with HIV infection. 
	Surveillance and infrastructure development through programs focusing on HIV/STI/tuberculosis surveillance, prevalence surveys, laboratory support, monitoring and evaluation, training and strategic information management.
	Increasing capacity building.
	Promoting sustainability by the partner country. 


The DoD HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP), based at the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) in San Diego, California, provides technical assistance, management, and administrative support of the global HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment for foreign militaries.
 DHAPP administers funding, conducts training, and provides technical assistance to participating militaries.  In addition, DHAPP staff members serve on most of the PEPFAR Technical Working Groups and Core Teams through the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. DHAPP provides HIV program execution and monitors outcomes, with staff that includes active duty military, civil service, and contract personnel.

This exterior yard is not ideally arranged for current research and suffers from the extreme summer and winter weather effects.
<p>This project is divided into two phases. Phase I will be the installation of a new ~5,000 SF pre-engineered metal building that attaches to the south side of the 331 building. Phase II will be the interior renovation of ~2,200 SF of existing aquatics lab space. The project is divided into two phases to be able to maintain on-going aquatics research while the project is executed. There will be a 1-2 week transition between phases as research will need to relocate from the 331 building into the new addition before Phase II can begin.</p>
<p>Phase I construction should commence in late March or early April with completion in October or November 2012.<br />Phase II construction should commence upon completion of Phase I and run for 2-3 months until about January/February 2013.</p>

<DESC>The Decomp Physical Model (DPM), also known as the Decomp hydrologic field test, is a large field-scale design test that will address scientific, hydrologic, and water management uncertainties specific to the CERP project Decomp. The goal of the design test is to obtain information to reduce uncertainties involved in the planning of later phases of the Decomp Project and CERP overall. The fundamental uncertainties the design test will address are related to the effects associated with canal backfilling, effects associated with levee removal, and the magnitudes and directions of sheetflow necessary to restore and maintain the landscape characteristics of the Everglades. The design test will be extensively monitored and will adhere to operational constraints described in the Draft Operational Guidance in the April 2010 Final Decomp Physical Model Environmental Assessment & Design Test Documentation Report. The project work consists of installing a new water conveyance structure (Structure 152) on the L-67A levee to convey water from WCA 3A to WCA 3B. S-152 is ten controllable gated 60" diameter culverts with a combined minimum flow of 750 cubic feet per second (cfs). In addition, a 3000 ft gap will be created in the L-67C levee downstream of the S-152 structure. Material from the L-67C gap will be used to construct backfill treatments in the L-67C Canal. 1,000-feet of canal will be backfilled to grade, 1,000-feet will be partially backfilled, and the final 1,000-feet will have no backfill. An additional feature for the contract includes a walkway for the S-152 structure. Contractor shall complete L-67C degrade and backfilling a minimum of 120 calendar days prior to completion of L-67A (S-152). INSTALLATION OF THE STRUCTURE AND BACKFILL PLACEMENT HAS ENVIRONMENTAL SENSITIVITY AS THE WORK IS PREDOMINATELY IN WETLANDS. WORK MAY REQUIRE PLACEMENT OF MATERIALS IN SURFACE WATER. Access to the project site is from US 41 (Tamiami Trail) by S-333 along L-67A and L-67C levees. Work is located in Miami-Dade County, Florida. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Award will be made to the offeror who submits the Lowest Priced, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) proposal. Proposals will be evaluated based on technical acceptability (demonstrated experience and past performance). Award will be made to the offeror who submits the lowest price proposal that is technically acceptable. Performance period is 180 calendar days. The magnitude of construction for this project is estimated to be between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. THIS IS A 8(a) COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION. The geographic area of competition is restricted to 8(a) certified firms in the State of Florida. All firms must have a Small Business Administration bona fide office in the State of Florida.

The Price Factor may become more significant in contributing to the source selection decision if competing proposals offer comparably-evaluated Past Performance Risks and Technical Approaches and due consideration is given to Key Personnel, Project Management Plan and Small Business Participation Plan.  The estimated time for completion is 1,860 calendar days.  These evaluation factors are subject to change.  Any changes to the evaluation factors will be shown in the solicitation.  The solicitation shall include a detailed list of evaluation factors, including any subfactors or elements, and shall provide instructions for proposal requirements and the basis for award.  The Government will not provide written paper copies of the solicitation.  Telephone, written, facsimile, or e-mail requests for the solicitation package will not be honored.

<p>Notice Type: Sources Sought<br />Solicitation Number: FA8818-12-R-0027<br />Reference Number: 12-29<br />Posted Date: 27 Jan 2012<br />Original Response Date: 21 Feb 2012Current Response Date: TBD<br />Current Archive Date: TBD<br />Classification Code: 58 Communications, Detection and Coherent Radiation Equipment<br />NAICS Code: 334220, Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address:</p>
<p>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Space Command, SMC/PKTV - Space Development and Test Directorate, Kirtland AFB, NM.</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis only. This is not a solicitation announcement and there are no Request for Proposal (RFP) documents to download. This synopsis is a market research tool being utilized to determine the availability of qualified sources. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used to make appropriate acquisition decisions. After review of the responses to this sources sought synopsis, and if the Government plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in Federal Business Opportunities.</p>
<p>Responses to this sources sought are not an adequate response to a solicitation announcement. As there is no proposal package or solicitation at this time, no telephone calls will be accepted requesting a proposal package or solicitation. In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations to be made.</p>
<p>The Space Development and Test Directorate (SD) Mobile Range Flight (MRF) contemplates issuance of a solicitation for use of commercial services to support Global Telemetry, Tracking and Commanding (TT&amp;C).</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Mobile Range Flight (MRF) has three core missions: <br />1. Receive, record, and relay booster telemetry data to support Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and operational customer requirements;<br />2. On-orbit checkout: Provide early-orbit test and calibration and provide insertion-orbit verification; <br />3. Contingency Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) support as required: emergency maintenance requirements, downtime to support system upgrades and support during system outages.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />The mission of the Space Test Branch (SDTT) is to:</p>
<p>1. Provide worldwide satellite booster and early on-orbit TT&amp;C for the United States launch community; <br />2. Support surrogate AFSCN commanding and real time status of health relay for Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) Satellites in the S-band (2.2-2.4Ghz) frequency range;<br />3. Support the space and telemetry communities with receive, relay, record, and play back at data rates ranging from 32kbps to real time relay (several Mbps) of telemetry and commanding.</p>
<p>Support of these three missions can span the EM Spectrum from L band through X band. Additionally, these missions require services from locations around the globe. MRF needs additional commercial services which can be leveraged with minimal lead time and little to no cost associated with dormant periods between missions.</p>
<p>In preparation, SD is conducting market research and seeking sources that have the ability to provide services in support of the TT&amp;C missions worldwide. Services may be provided by fixed stations or mobile assets, and services may be in one, some, or all bands of the EM spectrum currently used for sending telemetry and commanding to and from various craft (e.g. rockets, missiles, boosters, aircraft, spacecraft, etc). The Government will determine the qualifications of sources based on the statements of capabilities submitted.</p>
<p>Instructions for Submission:</p>
<p>SMC/SDTT requests interested, qualified sources who can meet the requirements, respond to this synopsis with a written Statement of Capability (SOC). This synopsis is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis, or to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.</p>
<p>The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas:</p>
<p>a. A description of the company's available services which could be leveraged to receive, record, relay, and play back telemetry across L-band, S-band, USB, C-band, and X-band<br />i. Include technical parameters of antenna systems, data throughput capacity of electronics/comm suites connected to antenna systems, and personnel required to provide services for each system.<br />ii. Provide geographic reference to highlight areas the company is capable of supporting.<br />b. A description of the company's capability to interface with the AFSCN or other US DoD Satellite Operations Centers.<br />c. A description of the company's status regarding certification and accreditation in accordance with applicable Department of Defense regulations and instructions on Information Assurance.<br />d. A description of any limitations on response time, data throughput, EM spectrum use, foreign operating rights, <br />e. Based on the available services to be leveraged, cost of services. Note: the government intends to seek pre-priced menu items to minimize lead time from need for services to provision of services. Cost should account for any non-recurring expenses in setting up any new communication hubs or other infrastructure to allow connectivity with the MRF or AFSCN<br />f. Description of company's business model used to secure customer funding for services provided. Should describe process by which the company supports a customer from initial contact to final close-out of effort.</p>
<p>Solicitation Information:</p>
<p>Any SOC not addressing all the above requirements will be rejected for the purposes of making set aside determinations. The SOC is limited to 25 pages. Submit only unclassified and non-proprietary information if possible. If proprietary information is deemed essential, all proprietary information should be clearly marked and associated restrictions on Government use identified. All potential offerors shall include company size status under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 334220 - Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing. Submit all responses to this synopsis to SMC/PKTV, Attn: Capt Michael Reed, 3548 Aberdeen Ave SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5776. In addition, electronic copies shall also be transmitted to Capt Reed at Michael.Reed@kirtland.af.mil and to Mr. Lloyd Porterfield at Lloyd.Porterfield@kirtland.af.mil. Responses from small businesses (SB) and small disadvantaged businesses (SDB) are highly encouraged. If you are interested only in subcontracting possibilities, please indicate this clearly in your submission. Please identify your company as either foreign owned or US owned. If US Owned, firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, an 8(a) firm, a historically black college or university, or a minority institution. The government reserves the right to set this acquisition, or portions thereof, aside for small businesses, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions. For this proposed acquisition, the definitions in FAR 19.001 and small business size standard for NAICS 334220, size standard 750 employees apply.</p>
<p>The research and test data produced under a resultant contract may contain Militarily Critical Technology List (MCTL) information whose export is restricted by the Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S. Sec 2751, et seq) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (Title 50, U.S.C., App. 2401, et seq).

<DESC>Market Survey for the Family of High Pressure Breathing Air Compressors <br><br>GENERAL INFORMATION:  The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "CONFIDENTIAL" under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<br><br>1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) "CONFIDENTIAL" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<br><br>2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "CONFIDENTIAL" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<br><br>3.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.<br><br>4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS:" and "CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS."<br><br>5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<br><br>6.  The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "Confidential" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.<br><br><br><br><br><br>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<br><br>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT.

The VISN 9 Network Contracting Office is conducting market research for the Lexington VA Medical Center to identify potential sources for a contract within the service area to provide Breast Care and other related Medical Imaging Services.  It is the intention of the Lexington VA Medical Center to solicit a proposal in accordance with all terms, conditions, provisions, specifications, and schedules and award a Firm- Fixed price contract on a competitive basis under the authority of 38 USC 8153.  

BACKGROUND: Access to health care services is one of the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) six domains of value and is a fundamental concern for VHA policy makers, administrators, and clinicians.  There are nearly 1.9 million female veterans with approximately 300,000 of them utilizing VHA care.  The number of women veterans is projected to double in the next five to ten years.  Today women make up 15% of the active-duty military and 18% of reserve forces and National Guard.  Therefore, women's healthcare services have become a major focus within the Department of the Veterans Affairs.  The intent of the VA is to ensure that breast care services are available and accessible to both male and female Veterans as needed. 

SCOPE: The Lexington VAMC anticipates awarding a single contract on a firm, fixed-price requirement in the near future. A solicitation will be conducted using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12, 13 and 15 in accordance with IL 90-99-4 for a period of one (1) year with four one year renewal options.

TERM OF CONTRACT AND PRICING: The contract is projected to be effective with a base year commencing sometime in 2012 through September 30, 2012, with four, one year renewal options to be exercised at the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><br />***NOAA's Acquisition and Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division - Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Air Liquide, of Longmont, Colorado for:
<p>&bull;	nine (9) cylinder regulators for their trace gas standards. The regulators must be of nickel&#8208;plated brass construction, two&#8208;stage, contain a stainless steel diaphragm with inlet pressures of 3,000 psi, supply pressure range of 2 &#8208; 50 psi, with a CGA590 inlet connection and flow capacity of 10 scfh (standard cubic feet per hour); and</p>
<p>&bull;	thirty (30) cylinder regulators for their trace gas standards. The regulators must be of nickel&#8208;plated brass construction, two&#8208;stage, contain a stainless steel diaphragm with inlet pressures of 3,000 psi, supply pressure range of 2 &#8208; 50 psi, with a CGA590 inlet connection and flow capacity of 25 scfh (standard cubic feet per hour).</p>
<p><br />***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) requirement for equipment which meets complex and highly demanding specifications.</p>
<p>NOAA's Carbon Cycle and Greenhouse Gases (CCGG) group operates a global multi&#8208;trace gas research which produces scientific standards for the air sampling network. The data gathered with this equipment is disseminated to other scientific organizations around the world which rely upon CCGG's accuracy for their own research. CCGG has developed rigorous standards over the years for the environments in which these gas standards are stored. The cylinders are made of aluminum and treated with a proprietary passivation coating. The cylinders are ordered with brass valves containing all&#8208;metal and nickel stems. Brass is required as it is less reactive with trace gases than is stainless steel.</p>
<p>Many of the gas standards require a special high&#8208;purity electron capture sensitive regulator and so CCGG needs a regulator for these cylinders that must is compact, two&#8208;stage, high purity, and low&#8208;flow. They must be nickel plate brass with stainless steel diaphragms and low internal volume. The desired flow rate, purity level and corrosiveness of the standard gas determine which delivery pressure range and gauge delivery pressure is required.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in determining the extent of all firms, large, small, and the socio-economic market for the type of work described herein. The intent of the announcement is to identify sources that are qualified business concerns with the capabilities of providing the National Ocean Service (NOS), Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R) with the services described below. 

The purpose of this contract will be to provide environmental assessments, on short notice, during oil and hazardous material releases, marine debris pollution incidents and respond to spills; to conduct training, drills, and other preparedness activities for both NOAA and external partners, identify and develop information sources that can be used to advance the state-of-the-art in response operations; and to conduct environmental sensitivity index mapping. The work primarily occurs in coastal areas of the United States, but occasionally may occur in inland regions as well as areas outside the United States.

There are 3 major tasks under the proposed contract:

1) Incident Response and Incident Response Exercises  NOAA responds to approximately 120 incidents annually, including oil and hazardous material responses and major response exercises. Approximately half of these events (60) would require the contractor to provide information on environmental effects, resources at risk, and the suitability of mitigation measures. Typically this information will be provided remotely, but for larger incidents and drills, the contractor may be required to respond on-scene.  Regardless of whether the contractor is working remotely or on-scene, the incidents routinely involve complex decisions associated with resource impacts, natural resource protection priorities and shoreline cleanup strategies. The contractor must have fundamental knowledge of the physical (especially geomorphological), chemical, and biological processes that affect these activities and the environmental consequences resulting from response actions.  The contractor must also have appropriate training and experience working within the National Incident Management System and Incident Command System (NIMS ICS). The contractor must maintain this capability in an on-call status 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Additionally the contractor should possess the ability to rapidly augment staff through subcontracting during large incidents; accordingly expanding capacity to adequately support additional and/or evolving OR&R response requirements within the scope of this contract.  The contractor shall perform the work at one or more of these locations: the scene of or command post(s) for an incident: NOAA facilities in Seattle, WA or Silver Spring, MD; U.S. Coast Guard Sector or District offices (in support of Scientific Support Coordinators) or at the contractors location.  The contractor work includes, but is not limited to: 1) provide detailed reports, on short notice, of environmental effects, resources at risk, and mitigation strategies associated with oil and hazardous chemical incidents in support of OR&R's response, assessment, restoration and marine debris actions associated with an incident; 2) review and report on the suitability of specific mechanical, chemical, and biological treatment methods appropriate to oil or other hazardous material releases in support of OR&R's role in assessing treatment requirements during spill response activities; 3) design and carry out field studies and shoreline surveys in support of both immediate response operations and long term follow-up investigations.  Sampling plans will include types, locations, and numbers of samples required, and sites for collection of control samples.  Methods will be described or referenced, including those for quality assurance and control as well as data management strategies; 4) provide emergency consultation and analytical support for environmental and industrial chemistry.  This may include quick response evaluation of potential health and safety issues associated with vessel cargo or facility contents, consultation on fate and behavior of oil or hazardous material released into the environment, and rapid analytical and interpretive services for samples collected during an incident, and 5) complete post-incident summary reports and publications on response, assessment, restoration and marine debris strategies used during the incidents or any additional government-sponsored programs.
  
2) Spill Response Training - The contractor shall assist in developing training for NOAA and other personnel in responding to oil and hazardous chemical releases. Training evolutions will occur typically in conjunction with response simulations, training programs, seminars, and conferences. Activities include development of training courses that address coastal physical processes, field methods, environmental sensitivity, spill protection and cleanup strategies, and case histories.  As a part of this training, the contractor may prepare segments of simulation exercises related to environmental assessment and provide resultant critiques of response team performance.

3) Spill Preparedness and Planning - The contractor shall develop and prepare information to support local, regional, and national contingency planning efforts for oil and hazardous material spill responses and other emergencies in coastal areas. Plans will include information on environmental effects, resources at risk, identification of sensitive sites, and the evaluation of mitigation measures.  This might involve complex tradeoffs associated with natural resource protection priorities and shoreline cleanup strategies. The contractor shall evaluate the most effective combination of response technologies for protecting sensitive resources including mechanical countermeasures, chemical countermeasures, bioremediation, in-situ burning, and natural recovery.  Examples of products include shoreline protection and cleanup manuals, environmental risk assessments for port or area contingency plans, and Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) maps.

<p>Description<br />H-65 Dynamic Component Improved Reliability pressure Sensors; Request for Information<br />This is not a request for proposals. This is a Request for Information (RFI) released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e). This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p><br />The Coast Guard is offering a proposed Sensor Acquisition package for industry comment. This is intended to be an opportunity for qualified vendors to provide suggestions to improve the specification and other documents that will be included in the acquisition of improved reliability pressure sensor s for the MH-65E.</p>
<p>The H-65 avionics system modernization plan includes the incorporation of the US Army Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS). The pressure sensors listed in the attached specification must be replaced in order to meet the performance requirements of the new system. Draft acquisition documents are attached for review. Potential suppliers are encouraged to review the attached document and provide written suggestions to the contracting officer.</p>
<p>Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified "hub zone" firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POC's and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POC's for civilian users for general usage of product questions? Responses to this RFI are not an adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. All companies that can meet the specification are encouraged to provide a capability statement, company literature, brochures, or any other information that demonstrates that the specification can be met. Telephone responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received no later than 06 February at 3 p.m. EST. This notice is intended to provide interested parties with an opportunity to improve the H-65 specification only. All firms responding to this request for information are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement. Responses to this RFI are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation. Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.</p>
<p>Point of Contact</p>
<p>The Coast Guard is publishing this request for information and will consider suggestions from qualified suppliers. Suggestions must be received at the following address no later than 10 February 2012.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer<br />Attn: Ryan Suchy<br />Short Range Recovery (SRR) Product Line Division<br />USCG Aviation Logistics Center <br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909-5001</p>
<p>Advance copies may be sent by e-mail to ryan.m.suchy@uscg.mil (the contract specialist) including the following in the subject line "H-65 Pressure Sensor Comments, Company Name". Correspondence must include a company point of contact with address, phone number and email address.</p>
<p>At the discretion of the contracting officer, the Coast Guard may quote all or part of any suggestions or questions received in future correspondence regarding the pressure sensor acquisition. The original author will not be identified.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard will consider the information provided by qualified suppliers in the development of the pressure sensor technical specification and acquisition planning for the H-65.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Additional Project Details</p>
<p>1.0 Scope</p>
<p>The sensors may be installed in all H-65 aircraft. The requirement will include spares. The system and associated support plans will be designed to minimize Coast Guard inventory requirements.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The Coast Guard currently operates (102) H-65 aircraft. The aircraft is in the process of being upgraded by incorporation of the US Army Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS).</p>
<p>The H-65 is a derivative of the Eurocopter Dauphin aircraft. The current configuration is similar to the AS 365N3. The aircraft was originally built to FAR part 29 standards. Modifications to the aircraft are designed to current FAR 29 standards with exceptions approved for Coast Guard specific requirements.</p>
<p>2.1 Technical Data</p>
<p>The Coast Guard has limited data rights for the H-65 aircraft. Design data available for the sensor integration has been developed through measurement and test.</p>
<p>Suggestions regarding the SOW data requirements (4.13.5) in the SOW are requested.</p>
<p>2.2 Schedule</p>
<p>The current plan is to issue a request for proposals in February 2012 with first article delivery no later than May 2012.</p>
<p>3.0 Modernization Planning</p>
<p>The H-65 avionics systems improvements will replace existing equipment with current available commercial and government-supplied components. The system will include dual Honeywell HG764/GU Embedded GPS Inertial Navigation systems (EGI) and a HG7210CA01 RADAR Altimeter system (RADALT). The flight management system will be incorporated in the Collins CDU-7000 and other processors.</p>
<p>The sensors will be integrated with the Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) compatible Data Concentrator Units (DCUs), Sanmina-SCI P/N 544300-001.</p>
<p>3.1 Support</p>
<p>It is assumed that the pressure sensors will be consumable components. Availability of replacement parts through 2027 shall be addressed. Available repair capability will be considered.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />3.2 Open Architecture</p>
<p>The MH-65E will be designed to incorporate an open architecture to the greatest extent possible and use standard government and commercial protocols. The system should minimize proprietary interfaces and systems. Data developed at government expense will be used by the government without restriction.</p>
<p>3.3 Integration</p>
<p>The Coast Guard will integrate the sensors into the MH-65E airframe. The sensor supplier will be required to support the integration effort.</p>
<p>Sample fittings will be provided to the selected supplier to support the verification of the mechanical interface.</p>
<p>Suggestions regarding the adequacy of the interface data provided with this RFI are requested.</p>
<p>4. Vendor Qualification</p>
<p>Listed in the statement of work.</p>
<p>5. Evaluation</p>
<p>After evaluation of the information received, the Coast Guard may issue a separate request for proposals.</p>
<p>Selection and contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer provides the best value to the Government determined by a balanced, performance based evaluation of system capabilities, acceptance of the government defined comprehensive support requirements, past performance, delivery and price.</p>
<p>The planned system evaluation criteria are: Technical Capability, Past Performance, Risk, Experience, Delivery and Price. Proposals that exceed the basic requirements will be considered.</p>
<p>The evaluation and source selection process will consider each offeror's capability to provide a technical solution that best aligns with the requirements, is within the proposed schedule, and is affordably priced. An integrated assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, and risks of each offeror's proposal, together with the cost proposed, will be used to determine which proposal offers the best overall value to the Government.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK SYNOPSIS

"CURBSIDE PATIENT ASSISTANCE AND VALET PARKING  SERVICES"

SCOPE OF WORK:

The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Phoenix Arizona, has a requirement for Curbside Patient Assistance and Valet Parking Services to alleviate the significant parking problems experienced by our veteran patients utilizing our medical facility.  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, and transportation necessary to meet below described requirements.  

1. General Intent

a.	The Phoenix VA Health Care System (hereafter referred to as the PVAHCS or simply as the VA) is currently experiencing parking shortages as a result of increase in patient visits and construction projects in progress.

b.	The VA would like to implement a full valet parking service for Veteran patients to alleviate some of this congestion and facilitate smoother parking activity.  A variety of different methods and practices will be considered as proposed by the Offeror.  

c.	The Offeror will be required to assess the current VA parking situation, and take into consideration all provided government space and equipment as described herein.  The Offeror will provide its proposed valet parking plan, including all processes, materials, procedures, and staffing.  
d.	Upon award, the Contractor will be required to implement the proposed plan and carry it out on a day-to-day basis for the duration of the contract.  The Contractor will have thirty (30) days after this contract is awarded in which to set up operations, finalize staff requirements (including Government-administered background investigations), etc.  At the end of this thirty-day period, at the latest, full operations are to begin.

2. Current Estimates

a.	The VA is prepared to set aside a portion of existing parking spaces in a designated area for access by Contractor staff for performance of services as described herein. Offeror may acquire offsite parking areas to further increase capacity.

b.	The VA estimates that there are roughly 2,600 unique patient visits per day, some of which may choose not to use valet service. It is not the intent of this contract to accommodate all patient visits.

c.	Busiest times at the PVAHCS are weekdays with Fridays generally the least busy.  Weekdays are usually busiest from 8:00 AM to 3:30 PM.

3. General Contractor Requirements

a.	The Offeror is required to furnish a comprehensive technical proposal detailing the suggested valet parking plan.  This plan should include all labor, materials, supervision, equipment, and services to meet the needs of the VA.  The restrictions to this proposed plan and required elements are described herein.

b.	Contract services are to be provided Monday - Friday (excluding holidays list in this solicitation) from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM. The Offeror may propose different hours if they will provide value to PVAHCS.  Contract staff may arrive earlier and stay later as necessary to set up or break down equipment, signage, etc.  A designated Contract Supervisor (further defined herein) must be on-site during any performance under this contract.  The PVAHCS reserves the right to adjust these hours/location and other changes that are deemed necessary once the demand has been more clearly identified.

c.	Contract employees will require mandatory background investigations designated at the Low Risk (NACI) level performed by the Government.  No employee may begin work on this contract without the successful initiation of a background investigation by the Contracting Officer (CO).  Any employee whose background investigation yields unfavorable results is required to be removed from performance of this contract immediately.  The Contractor may be charged for these background investigations if needed (contract staff already holding Government clearance need only show evidence of such).

d.	The number of lined spaces identified on the drawings attached to this solicitation may not represent the actual number of existing lined spaces. It is the Offeror's sole responsibility to visit the site to fully understand the nature of the work and the conditions under which the work will be performed.  Failure to visit the site will not relieve the successful Offeror from providing services in strict accordance with the true intent and meaning of the specifications. During the site visit the Offeror is encouraged to obtain exact dimensions of each of the areas and determine number of spaces, which will be available at each location.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Regents of the University of Colorado, 3100 Marine Street, Rm 479, 572 UCB, Boulder, CO 80303.  This project will continue from time of award to September 30, 2012.This acquisition is to advance a project that explores the potential contribution of non-neuronal cells (glia, endothelial cells) to the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse.  The project explores the role of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a key receptor on these non-neuronal cells that causes their rapid proinflammatory activation in response to abused drugs.  The involvement of TLR4 will be assessed using TLR4 inhibitors microinjected into brains of rats and mice.  The project focuses on major drugs of abuse whose reinforcing properties are traditionally thought to result from direct interactions with neuronal cells in the mesocortical dopamine system.  This acquisition will facilitate studies on the modulation of drug reinforcement by non-neuronal cells by fulfilling three objectives.  The first objective will be to assess which mesocortical sites are key in mediating TLR4 effects on acute behavioral, chronic behavioral, and neurochemical outcomes of stimulant drugs.  The second objective will be to assess the immunohistochemistry of immediate-early genes (IEGs) and epigenetic changes induced by blockade of TLR4.  A third objective will be to determine what proinflammatory changes occur in response to the drug in the key mesocortical sites identified above.The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 611310, Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools and Code 541380, Testing LaboratoriesThe acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<p>(a) Mr Howard E. Marks Jr., ASC/AQH, has been appointed as Ombudsman. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendation to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.<br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for <strong>polarimetric hyper-spectral imaging(HSI) capability in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) and polarimeteric HIS capability in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR),</strong> was prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Requirements (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p><br />The solicitation number for this requirement is FA8601-12-T-0051 using FAR Subpart 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55, 03 Jan 2012.</p>
<p>This solicitation document is Full and Open Competition under North American Industry Classification System Code 333314. Size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The ASC/PKO Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract for the following requirements:</p>
<p><strong>Requirements: <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quantity of One (1) Long-Wave Infrared Hyper-Cam LWIR</span></strong></p>
<p>Upgrade for LWIR Hyper-Cam with Polarimetric Measurement Capabilities polarimetric hyper-spectral imaging (HSI) capability in the long-wave infrared (LWIR). The currently owned LWIR Hyper-Cam currently enables HSI measurements and we seek to upgrade this instrument with a polarizing element to enable polarimetric HSI data collection.</p>
<p><strong>LWIR Hyper-Cam polarimetric requirements<br /></strong>The specific technical requirements of this polarization hardware (PH) are as follows:<br />The optic must have a surface finish of 40/20 scratch/dig or better for quality imaging.<br />The optic must have an anti-reflective coating for 8-12 &micro;m to minimize the formation of ghost images at the image sensor.<br />The PH must enable the collection of HSI data between 8-12 &micro;m in two orthogonal polarization states, hereafter denoted H for horizontal (0&deg;) and V for vertical (90&deg;).<br />The PH substrate must be a non-hygroscopic material.<br />The extinction ratio of the PH must be 300:1 or better between 8-12 &micro;m. For example, the throughput of V-polarized light must be a factor of 300 less than H-polarized light when the PH is in the H position.<br />The transmission efficiency of the desired polarization state must be greater than 70% between 8-12 &micro;m.<br />Selection of the H or V polarization state must occur with an accuracy of 0.1&deg;. For example, H = 0.0&deg;&plusmn;0.1&deg; and V = 90.0&deg;&plusmn;0.1&deg;.<br />The user must be able to set arbitrary polarization orientations (other than H or V).<br />The H or V polarization angle must not fluctuate more than 0.1&deg; during data acquisition.<br />The instrument upgrade must be delivered within six months of receipt of order.</p>
<p>These research projects require calibrated polarimetric HSI data collected under challenging field (non-laboratory) conditions. To expedite field data collection and reduce probability of data acquisition mistakes, the polarizing hardware (PH) must be fully integrated into the instrument. In addition to the specifications above, the following requirements pertaining to its operation within the existing Hyper-Cam instrument and associated control software must be met:</p>
<p>The PH must have a clear aperture of at least 71 mm to enable use of the Hyper-Cam's full entrance aperture.<br />The PH must be placed behind the Hyper-Cam's on-board blackbody calibration sources to ensure the effects of the PH are accounted for during instrument calibration.<br />The PH must be removable by the end-user so that non-polarimetric HSI data can still be collected with the upgraded LWIR Hyper-Cam.<br />The Hyper-Cam data acquisition software must be modified so that specific polarization states (e.g., H, V, or arbitrary angle) can be selected using the graphical user interface (GUI). Additionally, the GUI must indicate which polarization state (H, V, or arbitrary angle) is currently active.<br />The PH must be fully functional using only the Hyper-Cam's existing power supply.<br />The Hyper-Cam data acquisition software must be modified so that the specific polarization state (e.g., H, V, or arbitrary angle) is stored in the header file of each raw polarimetric HSI data cube.</p>
<p>These projects also require a detailed understanding of sensor performance so that appropriate choices in the spectral, spatial, temporal, and polarimetric trade-space can be made for each experiment. A full-scale sensor model is needed to predict the radiative transfer process in the Hyper-Cam. The model must be written in Matlab as this is the computational environment our research group uses. Given a high-resolution scene radiance, the sensor model must accurately predict the instrument response as a function of Michelson mirror position by accounting for:</p>
<p>The spectral transmittance of the optical elements<br />The spectral self-emission of the optical elements<br />The vignetting effect of the stops and optical elements<br />The spectral detector responsivity<br />The interferometer sampling frequency<br />The optical throughput<br />The interferometer modulation efficiency<br />The angle-dependent effect of the polarization optic<br />Additionally, the sensor model must enable the prediction of the noise-equivalent spectral radiance as a function of instrument settings by accounting for the following noise sources:<br />The photon noise from the scene<br />The photon noise from the instrument<br />The readout noise<br />The detector dark current noise<br />The quantization noise<br />The spectral resolution<br />The camera integration time<br />The Michelson interferometer sweep speed<br />The angle-dependent effect of the polarization optic</p>

For example, the throughput of V-polarized light must be a factor of 300 less than H-polarized light when the PH is in the H position.<br />The transmission efficiency of the desired polarization state must be greater than 70% between 1.5-5.5 &micro;m.<br />Selection of the H or V polarization state must occur with an accuracy of 0.1&deg;.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: http://orca.bpn.gov/publicsearch.aspx.

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: http://orca.bpn.gov/publicsearch.aspx.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>DFAS 52.223-9000, "ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PRODUCTS" (OCT 2007)</p>
<p>The Environmentally Preferable Products clause is included in this contract to articulate the Government's polices on Green Contracting. FAR 23.403 sets forth the Federal Government's policy to acquire items composed of the highest percentage of recycled-content practical, in a cost effective manner while still obtaining other contracting goals. Recycled-content products are identified in the Environmental Protection Agency's Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be producing a similar list which designates Bio-based products. EPA guideline items (and USDA designated bio-based products, when designated) are seen as the minimum that should be considered when evaluating environmentally preferable materials. Other environmentally preferable materials and products not listed, but commonly used in industry outside of the Government, should also be considered.</p>
<p>The recently issued Executive Order 13423 (January 24, 2007) requires federal agencies to use sustainable environmental practices, including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, waterefficient, and recycled-content products. Moreover, it now requires that paper of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content must be acquired or used in Agency acquisitions of goods and services.</p>
<p>&sect; 1. Mandatory use of Paper and other products with recycled content.</p>
<p>(a) All paper utilized in the performance of this contract must be of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor, by responding to this RFP/RFQ, affirmatively acknowledges that they will, to the maximum extent practicable, use sustainable environmental practices including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products in the performance of this contract that meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items, which are found at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm. In addition, by responding to this RFQ/RFP the contractor is certifying the deliverables required under this contract shall meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items.</p>
<p>&sect; 2 Notice of Green alternatives in Offerors' product/service.</p>
<p>When offering a product or service that contains Green components as that term is defined at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm,</p>
<p>(a) the contractor shall make the Contracting Officer aware of such facts in the submission of their quote or proposal.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor, when appropriate, shall comply with FAR Clause 52.223-9 Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material Content for EPA Designated Products.</p>
<p>&sect; 2 Affirmative Duty of Contractors to adhere to Green Contracting Policy.</p>
<p>(a) Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to examine its packaging to eliminate or reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable material for nonrecyclable material in packaging.</p>
<p>(b) Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to find other materials utilized in the delivery of services under this contract and examine whether it can reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable materials for non-recyclable materials of items consumed in the furnishing of their services.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is issued as a Small Business Set Aside (SBSA) under the NAICS 624410 with a small business size standard of $7.0M.  <br><br>The Virginia Army National Guard will conduct three Yellow Ribbon Post Mobilization Events on weekends during March 2012 (not including March 30 & 31, 2012) and April 2012 (not including April 1 and 6-8). Each event will require child care services.  While the exact dates and locations have not been identified, one March event and one April event will be held in the Williamsburg, Hampton, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, or Portsmouth, VA area.  And, a second event will be held in March in or between Richmond, VA and Fredericksburg, VA (from Route 288, north-west to I64 and east to I295; from I295 north to I64; from the I64/I295/I95 interchange north on I95 to Fredericksburg, VA).

Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint." <br><br>Award will be made to the low price technically acceptable (LPTA) quote which represents the most advantageous scenario to the government considering the potential for multiple awards.  Therefore, vendors are not required to submit a quote for all events.  It is assumed, for the purpose of evaluating quotes, $500.00 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each purchase order awarded against this solicitation. <br><br>To be determined technically acceptable, interested vendors must certify no caregiver will be allowed to perform services under a contract with the Virginia National Guard (VaNG) until a search of the Criminal Record/Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors (SOR) and Department of Social Services Child Protective Services Central Registry has been completed with no results for the individual caregiver(s).<br><br>FAR provisions 52.212-3, including Alt I shall be completed and returned with your offer.

<DESC>Notice Type: Combined Synopsis/Solicitation  P12PS20152Spraying of high value trees in Rocky Mountain National Park to prevent infestation of bark beetles
(1)  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
(2)  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Submit written proposals referencing document number P12PS20152 in accordance with the instructions in this announcement
(3)  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55.
(4)  This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  The associated NAICS code is 115310.  The small business size standard is annual sales of $7 million.
(5)  This combined solicitation synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item:
	Carbaryl spraying of pine trees in Rocky Mountain National Park to prevent the spread of pine 	beetles.
(6)  Statement of Work:
This contract is for the application of a Carbaryl based insecticide to protect selected high value trees from bark beetle attack.  The work is divided geographically between the east and west sides of Rocky Mountain National Park.  Contract spraying may begin on April 2, 2012 and must be completed no later than May 23, 2012.   Trail Ridge Road access from one side of the park to the other may not be available, due to snow levels, prior to the May 23rd contract completion date.  If administrative travel is permitted for National Park Service (NPS) employees, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) may escort the contractor through the Park if administrative vehicular travel requirements are met by the contractor. 	Logistical challenges may vary by site and multiple sites may require extensive covering of sensitive surfaces that include but are not limited to: vehicles, water faucets, picnic tables, fire grates, RV's, clothes lines, BBQ grills and hand railings.  All materials and equipment (tarps, flagging, chemical, etc) are to be provided by the contractor.  Contractors must be state-licensed commercial applicators.  It is the contractor's responsibility to obtain current knowledge and maintain compliance with all local, state and federal regulations.  Site closures and pre-treatment notifications will be conducted and managed by park personnel.  A designated COR will orient the contractor to each site and provide final approval to treat upon confirmation that the sites are closed, properly prepared and favorable spray conditions exist. 
Work delays (up to several days) may occur for some treatment locations due time required to coordinate site closures and associated notifications.  Additional delays should be expected due to frequent unfavorable weather conditions.  In 2011, approximately half of the eligible days for spraying did not meet the environmental conditions acceptable for spraying.  Weather conditions are often much different in spray areas compared to other areas along the Front Range of Colorado. Some sites (denoted with an "") may have a very limited number of days in which they will be available to be treated.  Please reference last year's calendars for perspective, available at the following website:  http://www.nps.gov/romo/parkmgmt/business_Opportunities.htm.     
Road construction along Bear Lake Road may result in at least two, 30 minute delays in one direction.  Sites that may be affected are denoted with a "" in the table, posted at the same website referenced above.  These delays will be present throughout the contract period.  Please reference the Park's website for additional information on Bear Lake Road construction: (http://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/bearlakeroad_reconstruction.htm).  
Submittals required one week after award, prior to work beginning:
1) Copies of current Colorado state commercial pesticide applicator license for each applicator scheduled to work on the project.  Government issued identification may be requested to confirm the identity of the applicator and their respective spray certifications. 
2) Copies of the label and MSDS for the proposed insecticide to be used must also be submitted prior to beginning work and the contractor must maintain a copy in possession on site at all times during project operations. 
3)  Evidence of liability insurance for prime contractor
4)  Proposed schedule of spraying must be submitted to and approved by COR 
5) Identify any sub-contractors, if applicable
Submittals required at completion of work, prior to final payment:
1)  Within 30 days of the contract completion, the contractor must supply the COR with a project summary, including a list of locations sprayed, the number of trees sprayed, total pesticide applied, total active ingredient applied for each location and pH test results from each tank fill.
Treatment Requirements and Limitations1.	Period of Performance:  treatment may begin no earlier than April 2nd, 2012 and be completed by 	May 23th, 2012.2.	Coordination, at times on a daily basis, must be made with the COR to confirm spray locations to 	confirm administrative and environmental conditions have been met.3.	Treatment may be conducted Monday through Friday when daylight allows visibility of the entire 	target tree, or as refined by the COR.4.	Due to closure requirements, some sites (listed with ) will have restricted days and hours for 	treatment.  This will likely include one evening (after 6PM, before dark) or a mid-day (10AM to 1PM) during a weekday for each site.   5.	All trees to be treated will be marked with a light blue tree paint dot near the base of the tree on 	the side of the tree facing the nearest road.  Only trees marked with light blue dots may be treated.6.	All portions of marked trees greater than 3 inches in diameter at least 50 feet must be treated.  	This includes the trunk, large branches and exposed roots until they taper down to less then 3 	inches in diameter.  It is required that all sides and areas of the tree above be thoroughly covered 	with insecticide. 7.	After a tree has been successfully treated (or moments before) the contractor may mark the tree in 	a manner approved by the COR.8.	A carbaryl-based insecticide (approved by the COR) must be used according to the 	manufacturer's label requirements for repelling mountain pine beetles.9.	Treatment must be conducted after snow melt when the entire tree trunk and surface roots are 	visible.10.	A 200 foot buffer zone around target trees, clear of the public, park employees (without personal 	protective equipment), and vehicles (except the contractor's), is required before and during 	treatment.  Buildings within 200 feet must be unoccupied before and during treatment.11.	A 100 foot treatment free buffer zone from streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, riparian areas or other 	open water is required.  The NPS will not mark trees for treatment within this buffer zone.12.	Weather requirements for treatment: wind speeds at the treatment site are 5 mph (5 minute 	average) or less, no rain expected within 2 hours.  The contractor is responsible for monitoring 	the wind speeds and forecast and to stop operations as appropriate.  If rain falls on treated trees 	within 2 hours of treatment, the contractor will notify the COR who will determine whether 	affected trees will need to be re-treated.  If the COR determines that a reapplication is necessary it 	will be at no additional cost to the government.  In 2011, approximately half of the eligible days 	for spraying did not meet the environmental conditions acceptable for spraying.  13.	Before and during treatment, the following items within 200 feet of targeted trees must be 	completely covered by the contractor with plastic or other material impenetrable by the 	insecticide:  picnic tables, tent pads, fire grates, trash cans, faucet taps, vehicles and other 	commonly touched items.	a.	Coverings must remain on the above items until dry.	b.	Coverings must be securely fastened so as not to blow away.	c.	Coverings should be clean and chemical-free on the side that contacts the item to be 			covered.	d.	The contractor must remove all coverings within 24 hours of treatment.	e.	The contractor is responsible for the proper disposal of the covering material.14.	It is the responsibility of the contractor to wash all overspray as identified by the COR to be 	unacceptable.  This generally includes sensitive surfaces designed for human use but may also 	include excess amounts of overspray on siding of buildings. 15.	Proper disposal of all chemical containers is the responsibility of the contractor and must be done 	in accordance with manufacturer, Local, State and Federal requirements.16.	All chemical containers must be clearly labeled with legible manufacturer's labels.  MSDS sheets 	must be readily available for all chemical products the contractor possesses.  17.	It is the contractor's responsibility to adhere to the product label guidelines and to ensure that 	their employees are wearing the required personal protective equipment.18.	It is the contractor's responsibility to obtain current knowledge and maintain compliance with all 	local, state and federal regulations.  19.	The contractor will have, on site, the supplies and equipment necessary to conduct proper 	containment and clean up of any spills or leaks. 20.	The COR may stop treatment operations if there are concerns with: spray drift beyond 200 ft or 	onto buildings and riparian areas, site contamination, public exposure to insecticide and / or any 	safety concern.21.	Accurate pH tests will be conducted by the contractor.  These results will be verified with 	RMNP's water lab.22.	The contractor must ensure water used meets the pH levels specified by the product manufacturer 	during each tank fill.  If water pH levels are outside of the acceptable range, it is the contractor's 	responsibility to supply and use a proper buffer or to find another water source with pH levels 	within the acceptable range. Records from contractor pH testing must be available for review at 	the request of the COR.23.	Upon completion of spraying in an application area, a government representative and contractor 	representative will conduct a walk-through of the unit to ensure overall compliance has been met.

NOTE:  All FAR clauses and provisions listed below may be found online at the following website:  www.acquisition.gov/far
(9)  FAR 52.212.-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (June 2008) applies to this acquisition.  Offerors shall submit a written price quote in one envelope, and their technical proposal, prior experience and past performance references in a separate envelope.  
A.  Offerors must submit a technical proposal in order to be considered for award.  The technical proposal shall address how the work will be accomplished, considering the specifications included herein, including, but not limited to, the following items:
"	what type of equipment will be used,"	the number and experience of personnel assigned to this work"	the plan, equipment, and personnel to protect sensitive items,"	previous experience applying pesticides to prevent mountain pine beetle infestation, including site complexities and numbers of trees sprayed, work performed in the vicinity of roads, structures, utility lines, vehicles, homes, picnic tables, trails and similar visitor use areas.  This experience should demonstrate the offeror's technical ability to accomplish the work.
B.  Proposals must include at least 3 contacts for past performance.  These contacts shall include name, organization, phone number and e-mail, if possible, for the 3 most relevant projects completed by the contractor  in similar size and complexity.  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which the contractor has satisfied its customers in the past.  The NPS will evaluate offerors' past performance based on the references provided by the contractor, the Government's knowledge of offerors' past performance; and / or references obtained from any other source. The Government reserves the right to limit the number of references it ultimately contacts and to contact references or use sources other than those provided by the offeror to obtain information related to past performance.  The Government shall attempt to contact the same number of references for each Offeror.
C.  .  The government intends to award a firm fixed price contract based upon a price per tree. Offerors must submit a price proposal in an envelope separate from the technical proposal and past performance information with a price/tree sprayed, all costs inclusive.  This is an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) acquisition.  The price per tree is a firm fixed price for all quantities of trees sprayed. The government only guarantees the minimum number of trees will be sprayed as listed below:
East Unit :   Minimum # trees to be sprayed: 4,500;  Maximum # trees: 5,700West Unit :  Minimum # trees to be sprayed: 500	;  Maximum # trees - 1,000Total minimum of 5,000; maximum of 6,700. Price Quote:
CLIN  001: East unit Price/tree_____________ x 4,500 = Total Line Item Price_______________CLIN  002: West unit Price/tree _____________ x 500 = Total Line Item Price _________________Total price quote (CLINS 001 and 002 combined) __________________________
Contractors must submit a price quote on the minimum number of trees to be sprayed and include all line items; failure to do so may render the offer unacceptable. In case of error in extension of prices, unit price governs.  In case of error in summation, the total of the corrected amounts governs.  Final price paid will be for actual amount of trees sprayed.

SITE VISIT:  A mandatory site visit is scheduled for February 14 at 10:00 am.  Contractors shall meet at the Beaver Meadows Visitor Center on Hwy 36.   Contractors are advised to come prepared with all information related to the contract, as no hard copies will be provided.   A map to this visitor center is available at:  www.nps.gov/romo.  No proposals will be considered from a contractor who does not attend this site visit.  The government will determine if weather conditions prevent the site visit from occurring.  In this circumstance, an amendment to this announcement will be posted to fedbizopps.gov.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to check the website for amendments.

1)  Within 30 days of the contract completion, the contractor must supply the COR with a project summary, including a list of locations sprayed, the number of trees sprayed, total pesticide applied, total active ingredient applied for each location and pH test results from each tank fill.
Treatment Requirements and Limitations1.	Period of Performance:  treatment may begin no earlier than April 2nd, 2012 and be completed by 	May 23th, 2012.2.	Coordination, at times on a daily basis, must be made with the COR to confirm spray locations to 	confirm administrative and environmental conditions have been met.3.	Treatment may be conducted Monday through Friday when daylight allows visibility of the entire 	target tree, or as refined by the COR.4.	Due to closure requirements, some sites (listed with ) will have restricted days and hours for 	treatment.  This will likely include one evening (after 6PM, before dark) or a mid-day (10AM to 1PM) during a weekday for each site.   5.	All trees to be treated will be marked with a light blue tree paint dot near the base of the tree on 	the side of the tree facing the nearest road.  Only trees marked with light blue dots may be treated.6.	All portions of marked trees greater than 3 inches in diameter at least 50 feet must be treated.  	This includes the trunk, large branches and exposed roots until they taper down to less then 3 	inches in diameter.  It is required that all sides and areas of the tree above be thoroughly covered 	with insecticide. 7.	After a tree has been successfully treated (or moments before) the contractor may mark the tree in 	a manner approved by the COR.8.	A carbaryl-based insecticide (approved by the COR) must be used according to the 	manufacturer's label requirements for repelling mountain pine beetles.9.	Treatment must be conducted after snow melt when the entire tree trunk and surface roots are 	visible.10.	A 200 foot buffer zone around target trees, clear of the public, park employees (without personal 	protective equipment), and vehicles (except the contractor's), is required before and during 	treatment.  Buildings within 200 feet must be unoccupied before and during treatment.11.	A 100 foot treatment free buffer zone from streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, riparian areas or other 	open water is required.  The NPS will not mark trees for treatment within this buffer zone.12.	Weather requirements for treatment: wind speeds at the treatment site are 5 mph (5 minute 	average) or less, no rain expected within 2 hours.  The contractor is responsible for monitoring 	the wind speeds and forecast and to stop operations as appropriate.  If rain falls on treated trees 	within 2 hours of treatment, the contractor will notify the COR who will determine whether 	affected trees will need to be re-treated.  If the COR determines that a reapplication is necessary it 	will be at no additional cost to the government.  In 2011, approximately half of the eligible days 	for spraying did not meet the environmental conditions acceptable for spraying.  13.	Before and during treatment, the following items within 200 feet of targeted trees must be 	completely covered by the contractor with plastic or other material impenetrable by the 	insecticide:  picnic tables, tent pads, fire grates, trash cans, faucet taps, vehicles and other 	commonly touched items.	a.	Coverings must remain on the above items until dry.	b.	Coverings must be securely fastened so as not to blow away.	c.	Coverings should be clean and chemical-free on the side that contacts the item to be 			covered.	d.	The contractor must remove all coverings within 24 hours of treatment.	e.	The contractor is responsible for the proper disposal of the covering material.14.	It is the responsibility of the contractor to wash all overspray as identified by the COR to be 	unacceptable.  This generally includes sensitive surfaces designed for human use but may also 	include excess amounts of overspray on siding of buildings. 15.	Proper disposal of all chemical containers is the responsibility of the contractor and must be done 	in accordance with manufacturer, Local, State and Federal requirements.16.	All chemical containers must be clearly labeled with legible manufacturer's labels.  MSDS sheets 	must be readily available for all chemical products the contractor possesses.  17.	It is the contractor's responsibility to adhere to the product label guidelines and to ensure that 	their employees are wearing the required personal protective equipment.18.	It is the contractor's responsibility to obtain current knowledge and maintain compliance with all 	local, state and federal regulations.  19.	The contractor will have, on site, the supplies and equipment necessary to conduct proper 	containment and clean up of any spills or leaks. 20.	The COR may stop treatment operations if there are concerns with: spray drift beyond 200 ft or 	onto buildings and riparian areas, site contamination, public exposure to insecticide and / or any 	safety concern.21.	Accurate pH tests will be conducted by the contractor.  These results will be verified with 	RMNP's water lab.22.	The contractor must ensure water used meets the pH levels specified by the product manufacturer 	during each tank fill.  If water pH levels are outside of the acceptable range, it is the contractor's 	responsibility to supply and use a proper buffer or to find another water source with pH levels 	within the acceptable range. Records from contractor pH testing must be available for review at 	the request of the COR.23.	Upon completion of spraying in an application area, a government representative and contractor 	representative will conduct a walk-through of the unit to ensure overall compliance has been met.

NOTE:  All FAR clauses and provisions listed below may be found online at the following website:  www.acquisition.gov/far
(9)  FAR 52.212.-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (June 2008) applies to this acquisition.  Offerors shall submit a written price quote in one envelope, and their technical proposal, prior experience and past performance references in a separate envelope.  
A.  Offerors must submit a technical proposal in order to be considered for award.  The technical proposal shall address how the work will be accomplished, considering the specifications included herein, including, but not limited to, the following items:
"	what type of equipment will be used,"	the number and experience of personnel assigned to this work"	the plan, equipment, and personnel to protect sensitive items,"	previous experience applying pesticides to prevent mountain pine beetle infestation, including site complexities and numbers of trees sprayed, work performed in the vicinity of roads, structures, utility lines, vehicles, homes, picnic tables, trails and similar visitor use areas.  This experience should demonstrate the offeror's technical ability to accomplish the work.
B.  Proposals must include at least 3 contacts for past performance.  These contacts shall include name, organization, phone number and e-mail, if possible, for the 3 most relevant projects completed by the contractor  in similar size and complexity.  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which the contractor has satisfied its customers in the past.  The NPS will evaluate offerors' past performance based on the references provided by the contractor, the Government's knowledge of offerors' past performance; and / or references obtained from any other source. The Government reserves the right to limit the number of references it ultimately contacts and to contact references or use sources other than those provided by the offeror to obtain information related to past performance.  The Government shall attempt to contact the same number of references for each Offeror.
C.  .  The government intends to award a firm fixed price contract based upon a price per tree. Offerors must submit a price proposal in an envelope separate from the technical proposal and past performance information with a price/tree sprayed, all costs inclusive.  This is an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) acquisition.  The price per tree is a firm fixed price for all quantities of trees sprayed. The government only guarantees the minimum number of trees will be sprayed as listed below:
East Unit :   Minimum # trees to be sprayed: 4,500;  Maximum # trees: 5,700West Unit :  Minimum # trees to be sprayed: 500	;  Maximum # trees - 1,000Total minimum of 5,000; maximum of 6,700. Price Quote:
CLIN  001: East unit Price/tree_____________ x 4,500 = Total Line Item Price_______________CLIN  002: West unit Price/tree _____________ x 500 = Total Line Item Price _________________Total price quote (CLINS 001 and 002 combined) __________________________
Contractors must submit a price quote on the minimum number of trees to be sprayed and include all line items; failure to do so may render the offer unacceptable. In case of error in extension of prices, unit price governs.  In case of error in summation, the total of the corrected amounts governs.  Final price paid will be for actual amount of trees sprayed.

SITE VISIT:  A mandatory site visit is scheduled for February 14 at 10:00 am.  Contractors shall meet at the Beaver Meadows Visitor Center on Hwy 36.   Contractors are advised to come prepared with all information related to the contract, as no hard copies will be provided.   A map to this visitor center is available at:  www.nps.gov/romo.  No proposals will be considered from a contractor who does not attend this site visit.  The government will determine if weather conditions prevent the site visit from occurring.  In this circumstance, an amendment to this announcement will be posted to fedbizopps.gov.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to check the website for amendments.

<DESC>Automated Threat Detection Algorithm for Processing Vehicle X-ray Images
Introduction:
This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  A formal Request for Proposals (RFP) and/or other solicitations regarding this announcement will not be issued.
X-ray screening of vehicles is widely utilized at Government facilities to search for illicit cargo such as drugs, weapons, and explosives.  The x-ray images produced can be complicated and time consuming to interpret.  In many instances, a vehicle will pass through the same checkpoint on a daily or weekly basis.  While the cargo located in this vehicle will change over time, the vehicle itself generally remains unchanged (e.g.
 dashboard, engine compartment, vehicle frame, etc.).  An automated threat detection algorithm capable of comparing the x-ray images of the same vehicle and highlighting the differences between the x-ray images could reduce the complexity and time required to screen a given vehicle.
The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) is issuing this BAA seeking development of software capable of the following:
	Storing to and recalling images from a database of vehicle x-ray images based on VIN, license plate number, or other unique identifier.
	Creating an image of a vehicle that highlights anomalies to the operator and suppresses consistent vehicle components.
Paper copies of this announcement will not be issued.
  In addition, NAVEODTECHDIV reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals in response to this announcement.  NAVEODTECHDIV will provide no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  It is the policy of NAVEODTECHDIV to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation.
This BAA will remain open for approximately one (1) month from the date of publication.  Proposals may be submitted at any time during this period.

1.7.1.  Definition of Problem/Threat:
X-ray screening of vehicles is widely utilized at Government facilities to search for illicit cargo such as drugs, weapons, and explosives.
  The x-ray images produced can be complicated and time consuming to interpret.  In many instances, a vehicle will pass through the same checkpoint on a daily or weekly basis.  While the cargo located in this vehicle will change over time, the vehicle itself generally remains unchanged (e.g. dashboard, engine compartment, vehicle frame, etc.).  An automated threat detection algorithm capable of comparing the x-ray images of the same vehicle and highlighting the differences between the x-ray images could reduce the complexity and time required to screen a given vehicle.
Envisioned Software Scenario:
Vehicle A is a delivery truck that enters the base daily.  Prior to coming onboard, it is inspected using a vehicle x-ray system.
 The x-ray image of the vehicle is analyzed by the system operator to determine if the vehicle or its cargo contains any anomalies that warrant additional inspection.
1.	Vehicle A approaches checkpoint and is selected for x-ray inspection.
2.	Operator of x-ray system enters license plate or other unique identifier of Vehicle A as it is in process of being x-rayed. The resulting x-ray image is saved to the database.
3.	The algorithm compares each new x-ray image of Vehicle A to the previous x-ray images of Vehicle A for anomalies and presents that information to the operator in a simple to understand format.
1.7.2.  Software Development Requirements:
Potential candidate software developers shall provide proposals for software development that meets the following criteria:
1.	 Max Cost:  300K
2.	Timeline for Completion:  6 months
3.	Biweekly status reports delivered no later than the 1st and 15th of each month for the duration of the effort.
  Reports to include current progress, potential risks or issues, and spending forecast.
4.	Deliverables:
a.	A software program capable of:
i.	Storing to and recalling images from a database of vehicle x-ray images based on VIN, license plate number, or other unique identifier.
ii.	Creating an image of a vehicle that highlights anomalies to the operator and suppresses consistent vehicle components.
b.	Software must be compatible with Windows operating system
c.	Software must be compatible with common image file types (JPEG, TIFF, PNG, and BMP)
d.	All developed algorithms for this effort are owned by the Government
Please note that the Government will provide all x-ray images of vehicles to the chosen candidate to assist in algorithm development.
Due to the nature of vehicle x-ray screening systems, images of vehicles will not always be of consistent dimensions.
  Algorithm must be able to adapt to images of the same vehicle that vary in X and Y dimensions.
NAVEODTECHDIV may choose to award one, none or several contracts. NAVEODTECHDIV may also reissue the BAA if no proposals are found to be acceptable.

1.7.3.  Other Unspecified Capabilities and Solutions:

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p><br /><br />APPENDIX 1</p>
<p>NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK (NAC)/HOST AGENCY CHECK (HAC). The government will submit an investigation request for the awardee on AF Form 2583, "Request for Personnel Security Action", at no additional cost to the contractor. The contractor must successfully pass a National Agency Check (NAC) US or Host Agency Check (HAC) UK to be eligible for contract award. Any contractor receiving an unfavorable NAC/HAC shall be terminated for the Default.</p>
<p>UNESCORTED ENTRY - CAC:</p>
<p>1. Those personnel requiring CAC cards are issued one because they are either authorized Logistical Support (i.e. Commissary, BX, and Gas Station) and/or computer access. US personnel shall have a NAC initiated by the gaining units Security Manager or for UK personnel the gaining units HAC POC. It is the Trusted Agents (TA) responsibility to ensure these checks are initiated.</p>
<p>2. The contract award document contains the information whether or not an individual is authorized Logistical Support or requires computer access in performance of their job. This has to be verified by the contractors TA.</p>
<p>3. TA's are individuals assigned by their unit to "sponsor" contractors in Contractor Verification System (CVS) allowing them to be issued a CAC. The TA will initially load the contractor in CVS which prompts the contractor to go into CVS and verify the information. The TA will provide instructions on how this is accomplished.</p>
<p>4. DD Form 1172-2, Application for Department of Defense Common Access Card DEERS Enrollment, must be completed and submitted with the DD Form 557, Appointment/Termination Record- Authorized Signature. The TA must fill out the DD Form 1172-2, all typed, if there is any hand written information on the form (other than signatures) the MPF office will reject the form. The TA must fill in Section I, Employee Information; Section II, Employee Declaration and Remarks, here is where the contractor's security clearance information (NAC or HAC) goes and all authorized Logistical Support, the contractor signs and dates boxes 37 and 38; and Section III, Authorized/Verified By, is where the TA fills in their information. They verify the contractors' signature in Section II and then the TA signs Section III. The DD Form 577, Appointment/Termination Record- Authorized Signature, and as the name implies, verifies the TA's name and signature. This is used to compare the name and signature in Section III of the DD Form 1172-2. MPF will not accept the DD Form 1172-2 or process the contractor in DEERS without a DD Form 577 indicating the TA.</p>
<p>5. Occasionally, a contractor may arrive at RAF Lakenheath assigned to a TA from another base, this is not a problem. In this instance the contractor must ensure they bring with them the completed and signed DD Form 1172-2 and a copy of the TA's DD Form 577.</p>
<p>6. If the contractor has dependents accompanying them the DD Form 1172, Application for Uniformed Services Identification Card/DEERS Enrollment, may be required. The completed form is required if the dependents have never been issued a DoD identification card. The TA is required to fill out and sign the DD Form 1172 and the form must accompany the contractor. If the dependents have a current card then the DD Form 1172 is not required to accompany the contractor as MPF will be able to pull the DD Form 1172 off of the system since the individuals will already be in DEERS. IMPORTANT: Contractors must report to MPF with their passport and Social Security Card and those of their family members as well.</p>
<p>7. The ORIGINAL DD Form 1172-2 and DD Form 1172 must accompany the contractor. This is per the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA); the original is required because MPF must send it to DMDC. If the contractor is assigned a TA from RAF Lakenheath the same information is required.</p>
<p>8. If the contractor is a foreign national they must first complete the steps listed below for a HAC. Once the HAC is complete the contractor must go to MPF and get assigned a Foreign Identification Number (FIN); the contractor will need to coordinate with their TA and MPF. The TA needs the FIN to load the contractor into CVS and it is also required on the DD Form 1172-2. The contractor shall take the completed form to MPF and they will input the DD Form 1172-2 into DEERS and issue the CAC.</p>
<p>9. The contractor shall take all of the required forms and documents to MPF on the ground floor of Bldg 977 and proceed with CAC/ID issuance.</p>
<p>HAC - Host Agency Check:</p>
<p>1. The Ministry of Defense (MoD), Defense Vetting Agency, conducts HAC checks on individuals who are UK nationals, US citizens without componency status (i.e. a retiree who chooses to stay in the UK) or third country nationals (TCN). If a person falls under one these categories they must reside within the UK for 4 years before a HAC will even be accomplished.</p>
<p>2. These individuals will be assigned a HAC POC by their gaining unit. The POC will initiate the MOD Form 1109, Host Agency Check, please keep in mind that this check can take 4 - 6 months to accomplish and is good for 5 years. In conjunction with the MOD Form 1109 the contractor will be required to complete a BCVR, Base Check Verification Record form; the AF Form 2583, Request for Personnel Security Action; and a USAFE Form 19, Residency Check.</p>
<p>3. After return of the security check the following will occur: the gaining units HAC POC will complete the USAFE Form 79 and submit a package with all completed forms to the HAC office for review. If there are mistakes the package is returned for correction and then resubmitted. Once a proper package is completed the HAC POC will give the contractor all required forms to bring to Pass and ID, in Building 977; the number is 01638 52 5990 or DSN 226-5990. Pass and ID will then issue the contractor either a USAFE Form 77, Base Pass, which is good for 365 days or a CAC depending on their required contractual duties.</p>
<p>ESCORTED ENTRY:</p>
<p>1. Contractor personnel requiring escorted entry on to RAF Lakenheath shall provide the first name and surnames of all personnel requiring entry. Provide a list of the vehicles that will be entering the installation to include: make, model and registration number. Also, the Road Tax disc must be current. Also include the award number, location of work and start/stop dates. This shall be on company letterhead and can be either mailed or sent electronically. Bear in mind that regardless of the submittal process the contracting office must have the paperwork five days prior to start of work. <br /><br />2. This information is then submitted to the requesting activity and they in turn provide the information to the Security Forces Operations branch.</p>
<p>NOTE: All contractors must arrive at the installation with a picture ID (i.e. passport or drivers license); if they are not in possession of a picture ID they will not be allowed entry.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Industrial Operations Division(IOD) Contracting Branch intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order using the procedures of FAR Part 12 and Part 13. This RFQ incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 327910. The small business size standard is 500 employees.
<p>This requirement is for the following:<br />E-STRIP, GPX Blast Media<br />Type VII (Starch-g-Acrylic) blast media that meets the requirements of Military Specification MIL-P-85891A, "Plastic Media for Removal of Organic Coatings" and ALC Engineering Specification GEN 13410.07B. <br />Type VII (Starch-g-Acrylic) blast media is an environmentally friendly product used for paint removal. It is non-toxic, biodegradable. The availability of this blast media fits with the engineering concerns related to the surface alteration and/or damage often related to the use of plastic abrasive used on Coast Guard aircraft undergoing maintenance at ALC. It removes a wide variety of coatings, from common polyurethane/epoxy paint systems, to more sophisticated systems such as rain erosion resistant coatings and radar absorbing material. It also removes vinyl from aircraft interior panels, sealants form components and/or fuel cells, and paint from cadmium plated parts where the plating was left intact. Selective layer stripping without substrate damage, and that it is detectable under black lighting for easy detection during post-strip inspection, are other characteristics of this product. Its use can replace chemical and plastic bead paint stripping systems traditionally used and limits exposure of personnel to hazardous materials.</p>
<p>In addition to the supply of the blast media, the offeror must be able to provide a spent media recycling and disposal service that meets ALC's mission of sustainable environmental stewardship.</p>

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D. C. 20593 -7112. Telephone (202) 372 3695.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.)

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<DESC>The U. S. Army Contracting Command, Natick Contracting Division in support of Product Manager Force Protection Systems (PdM FPS) has a requirement for Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract to provide personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services.  The objective is to provide SETA support to PdM FPS during all phases of pre-acquisition, technology development (TD), engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) production and deployment, and operations and support for Force Protection/Physical Security Equipment (FP/PSE) development/non-development programs and projects to assure the development process is fully integrated with respect to design, test and evaluation, production, operation and logistic support.   The primary mission of PdM FPS is research, development, acquisition (RDA), and the commercial product evaluation of FP/PSE under purview of the Army pursuant to DoDI 3224.03.   In addition, PdM FPS is responsible for: centralized management of PF/PSE for US Army users, joint service applications, and actions required to type classify such equipment developed by other services or Federal agencies for which a stated U.S. Army requirement exists; and assistance to other Services and Federal Agencies in the development and acquisition of FP/PSE systems.  This includes support to the DoD Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG) and its associated working groups such as the Interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG).  The following Technology Development (TD), Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Other Procurement Army (OPA) funded programs/products are currently being managed or supported by PdM FPS to meet DoD specific requirements:  Integrated Commercial Intrusion Detection System (ICIDS); Mobile Detection Assessment Response System (MDARS); Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System (BAIS)(AN/PRS-9); Lighting Kit, Motion Detector (LKMD)(AN/GAR-s); Force Protection Suite Project; Entry Control Point (ECP) Project; Non-Intrusive Inspection System (NIIS) Project; Rapid Deployment Integrated Surveillance System (RDISS) Project; Automated Installation Entry (AIE) Project and planning and execution of DoD Force Protection Equipment Demonstrations (FPED).  Emerging requirements for which SETA support would be required include Integrated Ground Security Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C); Tactical Security System (TSS); and Tunneling Detection. The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) in which Task Orders may be issued and will be for a one  year base period, a first option period of one year and a second option period of three months.  The Government will award to the Offeror whose proposal offers the best value in terms of Technical Ability, Past Performance, and Price.  The Government envisions Firm Fixed Price task orders.  The guarantee minimum is anticipated to be $2,500.00 for the length of each task order (base year) and the cumulative total of all Task Orders awarded will not exceed $49,062,064.65 over the life of the contract. The Government envisions that a single award will be made; however, it reserves the right to make no award or to make multiple awards, if in the best interest of the Government.  If for any reason, there are no successful proposals, or only one successful proposal, the Government reserves the right to re-open the solicitation.  This will be a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set-aside.  NAICS Code 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, applies with a small business size standard of $7,000,000.

Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br><br>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71.

Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items.

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br><br>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>Technical capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide traceability of new parts back to the Original Equipment Manufacturer. <br />Offerors must be able to provide manufacturer's Certificate of Conformance (COC) and its own COC to ensure parts are suitable for use on United States Coast Guard (USCG) aircraft</p>
<p>Prospective vendors who are not the manufacturer or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. This is a minimum requirement for consideration and there are no exceptions. The criteria in this section are pass/fail criteria.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.304(c)(3)(i), past performance will be evaluated and the elements listed below are considered sub factors of the complete past performance evaluation. Offerors are advised that more recent performance is more relevant than less recent performance and will be given greater weight in the evaluation process. In order to adequately evaluate an offeror's past performance, all offerors shall submit a list of three (3) contracts (references) completed within the preceding 6 month period. If an offeror has no relevant past performance history, offeror must affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance history.</p>
<p>Offerors shall include the following information for each contract listed:</p>
<p>(1) Name of Agency providing Past Performance Information <br />(2) Contract Number<br />(3) Contract Title <br />(4) Contract Type<br />(5) Brief description of contract and relevance to this requirement<br />(6) Total Contract Value <br />(7) Period of Performance <br />(8) Agency Contact, telephone number and e-mail address</p>
<p>Offerors may provide information on problems encountered and corrective actions taken on identified contracts. Verification of information will address, but is not limited to the subfactors listed below. <br />&bull; Documented or demonstrated performance, including but not limited to: <br />&bull; On-Time Delivery <br />&bull; Late Delivery <br />&bull; The number, frequency and severity of Quality Deficiencies <br />&bull; Resolution of notification of Quality Deficiencies. <br />&bull; Percentage of on-time delivery for all known contracts <br />&bull; Responsiveness as it pertains to urgent requirements, resolution of administrative problems, etc.<br />&bull; General accountability</p>
<p>The following relevancy definitions apply to each citation reviewed. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy.</p>
<p>&bull; Relevant: Past/Present performance efforts involved much of the size and complexity and have a logical connection with the work being acquired. <br />&bull; Somewhat Relevant: Past/Present performance efforts involved some of the size and complexity and have a logical connection with the work being acquired. <br />&bull; Not Relevant: Past/Present effort involved little of the size and complexity and had little or no logical connection with the work being acquired.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating. The Government may also use other information available from sources such as Federal Government sources, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS)/Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), and private and commercial sources to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>Delivery:</p>
<p>The offer must include delivery information on the spreadsheet titled "HSCG38-12-R-301003 Quote Sheet" in the column labeled "ARO". The government's required lead time for all line items is 365 days ARO. Offerors that can exceed the government's required lead time will be rated higher than offerors that can meet the government's required lead time.</p>
<p>F.O.B. Destination is requested as the F.O.B. point for the deliverables. All offers will be considered F.O.B. Destination unless F.O.B. origin is specified AND estimated shipping costs are included.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-7112<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses to this RFI, but is in need of information on potential sources.</p>
<p>Air Force Special Operations Command 27 Special Operations Wing Plans and Programs (AFSOC 27SOW/XP) is conducting a market survey to determine industry's capabilities to provide turnkey procurement of Modular Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) training sites using shipping containers, communications equipment, counter improvised explosive devices (C-IED) simulation equipment, including after-action recording (AAR) and playback technology at Melrose Air Force Range near Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico for the purpose of partnership with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) Train the Force initiatives, assisting United States forces in the defeat of improvised explosive devices.</p>
<p>The scope of the effort would entail performing a mix of design, fabrication, installation, integration, verification and fielding of approximately 600 "compound, village and urban building" assemblies on an active training range with some limited site preparation including AAR and communications technology integration, technology procedures and maintenance training.</p>
<p>The USAF has a requirement for assemblies to be delivered beginning in May FY12 through the end FY13. 27SOCONS intends to compete the Melrose Range C-IED Training Area with deliveries beginning in Spring 2012 through 2013. Our primary interface with industry will be the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (https://www.fbo.gov/) site. We anticipate releasing the Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) within 30 days. The Government anticipates scheduling a site visit prior to RFP release.</p>
<p>Interested vendors should supply meaningful documents indicating proven ability to execute this type of effort on a large scale. A format for providing both government and commercial projects past and present performance information is provided. In response to this RFI, please provide the following information:<br />1. A description of your company, including address, CAGE Code, DUNS and Point of Contact information and your intentions for competing for this award.<br />2.

Provide an estimate of the length of time that your company would require to mobilize. Address any risks that you foresee in completing the deliveries.<br />5. A description of your company's experience integrating disparate simulation software and hardware into an immersive mission training system with emulated equipment.<br />6. Identification of the top five risks you foresee in executing an acquisition of this scope.<br />7. The Government is especially interested in the technology challenges <br />8. Any other relevant topics, concerns, and information that will help the Government in forming an acquisition strategy.<br />9. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is expected to be 332311, with a size standard of 500 employees. Indicate whether you are a large or small business in relation to NAICS 332311 and if small, your small business type (Small, SDB, etc.). Provide any rationale for proposing alternate NAICS.</p>
<p>Responses are requested no later than close of business on&nbsp;23 January 2012. Given the need for a rapid response to this RFI, lengthy and elaborate presentation material and explanations are discouraged. Marketing materials are not a sufficient response to this RFI. Please limit responses to no more than 10 pages, excluding past and present performance reference sheets.

This is not a new accreditation requirement because the state of PA has already completed an audit assessment for accreditation and the requirement is basically for a renewal as stated previously.

<DESC>****&nbsp;This Request for Information (RFI) is hereby amended as follows:
<p>- The preferred font size is no smaller than 12 pitch.</p>
<p>- The cut-off date for the receipt of questions is February 3, 2012.<br />Answers to all questions submitted will be consolidated and posted to www.fbo.gov no later than February 10, 2012.</p>
<p>- The requested due date for all submissions is extended to no later than 24 February 2012. ****</p>
This Request for Information (RFI) is issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e). The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to secure information regarding the capabilities of industry to meet agency future requirements, for planning purposes. Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
<p>The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) is a United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) agency, with its headquarters at Fort Lee, VA. DeCA operates a worldwide chain of commissaries providing groceries to military personnel, retirees and their families. DeCA seeks information from commercial sources regarding their interest and ability to solution a data warehouse /corporate data repository hardware and software environment to meet the needs of the agency. DeCA currently operates 247 military commissaries worldwide with annual sales estimated at nearly $6 billion. Of that total, 180 stores are located within the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, and 67 stores located in 12 countries outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>A military commissary is a Government facility providing grocery products and other merchandise to authorized individuals, termed "patrons". It is a facility designed and operated similar to commercial supermarkets. DeCA's goals are to provide a significant price savings when compared to commercial markets; to provide courteous and informative assistance; to offer a variety of items in quantities and of a quality level to satisfy patron demands; and to provide products in a clean, safe, and wholesome environment. Overall management and operation of a commissary is the responsibility of the Store Director of each store, operating within Agency policy and standards.</p>
<p>Interested commercial sources are asked to provide information detailing a potential solution for the modernization of our existing data warehouse hardware and software platform. Currently, DeCA modernizes the data warehouse hardware and software every five (5) years, and is seeking state-of-the-art data warehousing options for modernization of the existing capability. The modernization may include, but is not limited to, cloud computing, virtualization, or remote data center options and/or any combination of architectural approaches that satisfy the requirement for modernization of DeCA's existing capabilities. The proposed modernization will include (at a minimum), proposed hardware and software, estimated costs, feasibility of implementation, action plans, timeline and impacts on projects (being developed or being deployed), based on our current environment, with an estimated 50% growth over the next 5 years. The page limitation for this request is set at fifty-one (51) single-sided pages, to include a one (1) page Executive Summary.</p>
<p>DeCA is expected to utilize the information obtained through this RFI process to develop its requirements for a long-term solution for EDW. The current expectation is that the long-term solution will be advertised separately at a future date. The contractor or contractors that may receive awards under any resulting solicitation would serve as the primary point(s)-of-contact for the modernization, and would be responsible for hardware and software installation and configurations, DoD security certification of hardware and software, migration and/or conversion of current Extraction Transformation and Load (ETL), scripts, queries, data, data models, reports, and projects that are currently being developed, tested, or deployed.</p>
<p>DeCA is interested in receiving information from interested commercial sources that addresses the following, at a minimum:</p>
<p>1. The concepts, strategies, and considerations that a commercial source would employ to provide the necessary products and/or related services that are available.</p>
<p>2. The concepts must include proposed hardware and software, estimated costs, feasibility of implementation, action plans, timeline and impacts on projects (being developed or being deployed), based on our current environment (see Attachment 2), with an estimated 50% growth over the next 5 years.</p>
<p>3. The strategies must include DoD Security certification of hardware and software, as well as migration and/or conversion of current ETL, scripts, queries, data, data models, reports, and projects that are currently being developed, tested, or deployed. In addition, strategies for hardware and software maintenance, data loss and recovery, network latency, data retention, and methods for managing complexity and risk must be addressed.</p>
<p>4. The considerations must include possible future expansion and implementation of data repositories to support mobile applications, mobile device use while shopping, m-commerce, e-commerce and other technology advancements as requirements arise.</p>
<p>Contact with the individual DeCA stores is prohibited. In the event that an offeror has any specific questions regarding this initiative, they are asked to refer those questions, in writing, to the e-mail address cited below. The written query will be answered by an appropriate subject matter expert.</p>
<p>Completed packages in response to this RFI may be sent via regular mail or electronically. The requested due date for all submissions is no later than 17 February 2012. The mailing location and e-mail contact information is as follows:</p>
<p>Defense Commissary Agency<br />Directorate of Acquisition Management<br />Attn: Store Services Support Division (LEAS)<br />1300 E Avenue<br />Fort Lee, VA 23801-1800</p>
<p>E-mail contact information: DeCA.Responses@deca.mil</p>
<p>Project Reference #: DECA-EDWRFI-2012</p>
<p>DeCA maintains a commercial website (www.commissaries.com) that can be accessed to find additional information about our organization and stores.</p>
<p>This is not a formal "Request for Proposal" (RFP), and no award will be made as a result of any submittals received in response to this request. Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future associated RFP that may be issued. Information provided in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0001 POSTED ON January 27, 2012
This RFO Amendment 0001 is hereby issued to:
1) Incorporate Questions and Answers 2) Incorporate a revised SOO3) Incorporate a revised Section L4) Incorporate a Section J Attachment 8 - Acronyms and Definitions
All other provisions, terms, and conditions of the subject RFO remain unchanged.____________________________________________________________________________January 18, 2012

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is issuing this Request for Offer (RFO) for an Enterprise Messaging System (EMS) through a Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Solution.  This notice is being posted in accordance with the FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS), Section 3.2.1.3.11, Public Announcements. 
Description of Required Services:
The FAA's current messaging system is a client-server based solution that uses the IBM Lotus Notes and Lotus Domino product lines. Other DOT organizations use Microsoft Exchange.  Support for the FAA is provided under a ten-year contract, currently operating under negotiated extensions.  In conducting its budget, business case, and requirements analyses, the FAA has determined that the traditional client-server approach to its current messaging system does not meet the need to access any data, anywhere, anytime, using any device, in the most cost effective way.  As a result, the FAA is addressing this challenge with its first entry into the cloud by transitioning to a seamless enterprise-wide commercially available cloud messaging service for approximately 80,000 users (about 60,000 FAA users; 20,000 other DOT users).  This first entry point into the cloud will be carried out through a phased approach to assure smooth transitions from a current infrastructure environment to cloud services.  Other additional services, as described in this SOO, will be considered within this context.
Nature of the Procurement: 
This is a full and open competition in which the FAA will evaluate proposals in accordance with the provisions of Section M of the RFO.  Small Business entities must meet the size standard for the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210, "Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services" with a SBA size standard of $25 million for this solicitation.  The FAA is contemplating award of a single contract for a period of performance of seven years (one year base period and six one-year option periods).  
NAICS Code:
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services with a size standard of $25 Million.
All interested sources are referred to the attached RFO.  All proposals submitted in response to this RFO must be addressed to the attention of John Gamble and Tye White, and reference the RFO Number DTFAWA-11-R-00043.  Proposals must be delivered to the following address:
Federal Aviation AdministrationBuilding 10A, Suite 406	800 Independence Avenue, S.W.Washington, D.C.  20591
The date and time for receipt of proposals is 3:00 p.m., Eastern Time, February 20, 2012 (facsimile and email responses are not permitted).  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals for Submittals.  Proposal submissions must be in accordance with Section L of the SIR/RFO.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined unacceptable.  Oral or written communications with offerors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary.
Questions regarding this RFO must be submitted via email to John Gamble, Contracting Officer, at john.gamble@faa.gov, with c.c. to Tye White at tye.white@faa.gov..  In order to finalize responses and provide to offerors prior to submission of proposals, questions will no longer be accepted after close of business February 13, 2012, 3:00 p.m. Eastern 
The FAA is not liable for costs associated with a response to this RFO.  This is a request for competitive proposals and will result in a contract award.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled MASTER OSCILLATOR POWER AMPLIFIERARCHITECTURE which was posted on January 19, 2012.  You are notified that the followingchanges are made: The Description of the previous synopsis is replaced in its entirety with the attachedwhich deletes the reference to "Item B" and which incorporates Table 1.The due date for responses is not extended.Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  Thesedocuments will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWWbrowser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunitieshome page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=51      Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation andany amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy ofthe solicitation and amendments (if any).Questions/Responses1.The RFI states that the initial emphasis will be on a short-term demonstration efforton power scaling, yet the specification in Table 1 lists a single power output level of1 Watt. Please explain what is intended by power scaling. Does NASA intend to scale theEDFA output to higher powers than the 1 Watt specification? Does NASA intend to scale theEDFA to lower powers?  The initial demonstration would be to take the seed laser (GFE) of output power nominallyin the power level listed in the RFI and power scale that to ~0.5 W (our projectedoperating average power).  The 1 W listed in the Table is margin we seek for potentialthe amplifier.2.Please explain the difference between Output Energy Flatness vs Time and OutputPower Stability in Table 1."Output energy flatness" refers to a requirement that in the event multiple channels(from different seed lasers) are used within the specified wavelength band, then theenergy output of these different channels shall remain constant.  The "output energystability" refers to the requirement that the energy output at a specific wavelength froma single seed laser shall be stable over the specified time duration.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.305 this Modification to the special notice posted on December 16, 2011 makes publically available the justification required by F.A.R. 6.303-1 as required by 41 U.S.C. 253(f)(4).
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
1.  Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Interior National Park Service, National Capital Region, Division of Acquisition Management.
2.  Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved:  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Over $100,000 (FAR 6.303-2).
3.  A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value:  
Summary:
As part of an active insurance claim Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts partner, the Wolf Trap Foundation has successfully secured $3,061,064 from Travelers Insurance for the complete replacement of the front and rear copper roof of the Filene Center and the small copper cupola at the South Gate concession stand.  The work of this proposed procurement consists of roof modifications not covered by insurance claim filed with The Travelers Companies, Inc. - The anticipated price for this work is $188,936.
Discussion:
Operations at the Filene Center in Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts are done in partnership with the Wolf Trap Foundation.  Operating under a cooperative agreement, the Wolf Trap Foundation handles most of the business side of Filene Center performances and visitor services, including box office operations, performance bookings, marketing, and food and beverage sales to patrons.  16 U.S.C. 284c (c)(3) states that as part of their responsibility under this cooperative agreement, the Foundation is required to hold a comprehensive fire and damage insurance policy on the Filene Center. 
The Filene Center roof has a considerable history of problems due to a badly engineered original design.  As a result of the poor design, substantial and ongoing water leaks have been a constant issue since the building was constructed in 1983. There are two sections of roof on the Filene Center roof that have copper sheathing.  The first portion is the highly visible area that covers the "house", which is the seating area in the front of the theater.  This area is approximately 15,205 square feet in size. The front roof area is an integral part of the design aesthetic of the Filene Center, and the visual showpiece of the building.  A second area of copper of 15,604 square feet, covers the rehearsal hall at the rear of the building.  
In May of 2010 a hailstorm caused considerable damage to the copper roof of the Filene Center, and to the small portion of the roof of the South Gate building that is also copper.  The Wolf Trap Foundation filed a claim with their insurer to replace the roof in-kind, and this claim was approved.  The Foundation then hired an architect/engineering firm to develop construction drawings for the project.
The Foundation's insurance company has agreed to pay the claim for the replacement of the roof, in-kind.  This includes the copper sheathing, and a standard rolled felt weatherproof layer underneath the copper.  
The NPS has determined that it is in the best interest of the government to use a self-adhering, ice-shield waterproof membrane layer underneath the copper in lieu of the felt which was previously used.  This decision is consistent with current industry practice.  In addition, it was quickly determined that replacement of the existing roof with new material, should include some small modifications to the original design to address problems.  Portions of the existing roof are essentially flat, and do not meet current building codes for slope and pitch to achieve necessary drainage.  The proposed modifications to the design of the new roof are to "fill the pockets"-i.e., reconstruct those flat portions to a slightly different angle-- so that those sections of the roof achieve the minimum pitch required by code. The costs of carpentry and materials required for this reconfiguration would not be covered by the insurance claim, and must be covered by NPS funds.  Finally, the NPS must pay for the replacement of any plywood or roof sheathing materials that have sustained water damage over the last 28 years.  With the continuous and ongoing history of leakage, particularly at certain vulnerable spots, some amount of wood replacement is anticipated.  
The Class A cost estimate on the portion of the work that the NPS is responsible for is:  1.       Self adhered membrane                      -Redacted-2.       Wood Stud and plywood system        -Redacted-3.       Wood deck repair (allowance)            -Redacted-                Total                                               -Redacted-
4.  An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: FAR 6.302- 1(2) and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) are sources of authority since only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.  
5.  A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: 
The Wolf Trap Foundation, as the owner of the insurance policy on the Filene Center, is acting as general contractor for the roof repairs covered by the insurance policy.  The Foundation will be submitting claims to the insurance company based on actual invoicing from the roofing sub-contractor.  The work not covered by the insurance policy is closely related to the work covered by the policy.  They do not consist of severable tasks and it would be illogical and irresponsible to attempt to do.  Doing so would introduce significant issues regarding the sequencing of tasks that could jeopardize or seriously hinder project completion.  Therefore, because the work of this proposed contract is not severable from the work covered by the insurance policy the Wolf Trap Foundation is the only entity that can be awarded this proposed contract.
6.  A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice Was or Will Be Publicized as Required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, If Not, Which Exception Under FAR 5.202 Applies: No exception under FAR 5.202 applies.  A notice expressing the government's intent to make an award to Wolf Trap Foundation was issued on December 16, 2011 in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2.  A post award notice will be issued in accordance with FAR 5.301(d).
7.  A Determination By the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the 	Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable: 
An independent government estimate of the government's portions of the project was prepared. This estimate used standard methodology for Class A estimates, including a full itemized materials take-off and standard labor-rates in the Washington DC area.  The anticipated costs of the proposed contract are consistent with the independent government estimate.  It has therefore been determined that they are fair and reasonable.
8.  A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market Research was conducted to explore the feasibility of separating the work of this contract from the work covered by the insurance claim.  This consisted largely of reviewing prior contract for similar work to establish what standard industry practice is for the phasing of the required construction tasks.  This was conducted by Architects and Engineers working for the National Park Service.  After this review it was determined that the work of this proposed contract is not severable from the work of the insurance claim.  
No other market research could be conducted because of the fact that no vendor other than the foundation itself is eligible to act as a general contractor for the performance of work covered by the insurance claim.
9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (see FAR 6.302-2 (9) (i) - (iii) for some examples):    Completion of the above mentioned work is essential to the completion of the work covered by insurance claim and must be performed concurrently.  Furthermore, at the conclusion of the contract the government will have corrected long-standing problems and installed a 50-year roof system on the mission-critical Filene Center, with less than 3% of the cost paid by the government, and 97% paid by non-government sources.
10.  A Listing of the Sources, If Any, That Expressed in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
After issuing the notice of intent on December 16, 2011 this office did receive written notice of interest from various roofing contractors.  However, none of these firms provided information that contradicted the findings shown above in item number five.
11.  A Statement of the Actions, If Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome    Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required:  
No further action is needed.  The need for this procurement is directly tied to the fact the insurance policy did not cover all of the required repairs and that the work covered by the insurance policy is not severable from the work not covered by the policy.  At the conclusion of this procurement the government shall have use and ownership of a sound and well-designed roof that has an anticipated life cycle of 50 years.   This one time procurement fulfills the Government requirement.  

12.  Certification:I certify that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (i.e. verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate:_____________________________________(Signature)  _____________________ (Date)(Type or Print Name):  __Karen Pittleman_Director, Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.305 this Modification to the special notice posted on December 16, 2011 makes publically available the justification required by F.A.R. 6.303-1 as required by 41 U.S.C. 253(f)(4).
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
1.  Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Interior National Park Service, National Capital Region, Division of Acquisition Management.
2.  Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved:  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Over $100,000 (FAR 6.303-2).
3.  A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value:  
Summary:
As part of an active insurance claim Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts partner, the Wolf Trap Foundation has successfully secured $3,061,064 from Travelers Insurance for the complete replacement of the front and rear copper roof of the Filene Center and the small copper cupola at the South Gate concession stand.  The work of this proposed procurement consists of roof modifications not covered by insurance claim filed with The Travelers Companies, Inc. - The anticipated price for this work is $188,936.
Discussion:
Operations at the Filene Center in Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts are done in partnership with the Wolf Trap Foundation.  Operating under a cooperative agreement, the Wolf Trap Foundation handles most of the business side of Filene Center performances and visitor services, including box office operations, performance bookings, marketing, and food and beverage sales to patrons.  16 U.S.C. 284c (c)(3) states that as part of their responsibility under this cooperative agreement, the Foundation is required to hold a comprehensive fire and damage insurance policy on the Filene Center. 
The Filene Center roof has a considerable history of problems due to a badly engineered original design.  As a result of the poor design, substantial and ongoing water leaks have been a constant issue since the building was constructed in 1983. There are two sections of roof on the Filene Center roof that have copper sheathing.  The first portion is the highly visible area that covers the "house", which is the seating area in the front of the theater.  This area is approximately 15,205 square feet in size. The front roof area is an integral part of the design aesthetic of the Filene Center, and the visual showpiece of the building.  A second area of copper of 15,604 square feet, covers the rehearsal hall at the rear of the building.  
In May of 2010 a hailstorm caused considerable damage to the copper roof of the Filene Center, and to the small portion of the roof of the South Gate building that is also copper.  The Wolf Trap Foundation filed a claim with their insurer to replace the roof in-kind, and this claim was approved.  The Foundation then hired an architect/engineering firm to develop construction drawings for the project.
The Foundation's insurance company has agreed to pay the claim for the replacement of the roof, in-kind.  This includes the copper sheathing, and a standard rolled felt weatherproof layer underneath the copper.  
The NPS has determined that it is in the best interest of the government to use a self-adhering, ice-shield waterproof membrane layer underneath the copper in lieu of the felt which was previously used.  This decision is consistent with current industry practice.  In addition, it was quickly determined that replacement of the existing roof with new material, should include some small modifications to the original design to address problems.  Portions of the existing roof are essentially flat, and do not meet current building codes for slope and pitch to achieve necessary drainage.  The proposed modifications to the design of the new roof are to "fill the pockets"-i.e., reconstruct those flat portions to a slightly different angle-- so that those sections of the roof achieve the minimum pitch required by code. The costs of carpentry and materials required for this reconfiguration would not be covered by the insurance claim, and must be covered by NPS funds.  Finally, the NPS must pay for the replacement of any plywood or roof sheathing materials that have sustained water damage over the last 28 years.  With the continuous and ongoing history of leakage, particularly at certain vulnerable spots, some amount of wood replacement is anticipated.  
The Class A cost estimate on the portion of the work that the NPS is responsible for is:  1.       Self adhered membrane                      -Redacted-2.       Wood Stud and plywood system        -Redacted-3.       Wood deck repair (allowance)            -Redacted-                Total                                               -Redacted-
4.  An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: FAR 6.302- 1(2) and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) are sources of authority since only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.  
5.  A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: 
The Wolf Trap Foundation, as the owner of the insurance policy on the Filene Center, is acting as general contractor for the roof repairs covered by the insurance policy.  The Foundation will be submitting claims to the insurance company based on actual invoicing from the roofing sub-contractor.  The work not covered by the insurance policy is closely related to the work covered by the policy.  They do not consist of severable tasks and it would be illogical and irresponsible to attempt to do.  Doing so would introduce significant issues regarding the sequencing of tasks that could jeopardize or seriously hinder project completion.  Therefore, because the work of this proposed contract is not severable from the work covered by the insurance policy the Wolf Trap Foundation is the only entity that can be awarded this proposed contract.
6.  A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice Was or Will Be Publicized as Required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, If Not, Which Exception Under FAR 5.202 Applies: No exception under FAR 5.202 applies.  A notice expressing the government's intent to make an award to Wolf Trap Foundation was issued on December 16, 2011 in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2.  A post award notice will be issued in accordance with FAR 5.301(d).
7.  A Determination By the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the 	Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable: 
An independent government estimate of the government's portions of the project was prepared. This estimate used standard methodology for Class A estimates, including a full itemized materials take-off and standard labor-rates in the Washington DC area.  The anticipated costs of the proposed contract are consistent with the independent government estimate.  It has therefore been determined that they are fair and reasonable.
8.  A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market Research was conducted to explore the feasibility of separating the work of this contract from the work covered by the insurance claim.  This consisted largely of reviewing prior contract for similar work to establish what standard industry practice is for the phasing of the required construction tasks.  This was conducted by Architects and Engineers working for the National Park Service.  After this review it was determined that the work of this proposed contract is not severable from the work of the insurance claim.  
No other market research could be conducted because of the fact that no vendor other than the foundation itself is eligible to act as a general contractor for the performance of work covered by the insurance claim.
9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (see FAR 6.302-2 (9) (i) - (iii) for some examples):    Completion of the above mentioned work is essential to the completion of the work covered by insurance claim and must be performed concurrently.  Furthermore, at the conclusion of the contract the government will have corrected long-standing problems and installed a 50-year roof system on the mission-critical Filene Center, with less than 3% of the cost paid by the government, and 97% paid by non-government sources.
10.  A Listing of the Sources, If Any, That Expressed in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
After issuing the notice of intent on December 16, 2011 this office did receive written notice of interest from various roofing contractors.  However, none of these firms provided information that contradicted the findings shown above in item number five.
11.  A Statement of the Actions, If Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome    Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required:  
No further action is needed.  The need for this procurement is directly tied to the fact the insurance policy did not cover all of the required repairs and that the work covered by the insurance policy is not severable from the work not covered by the policy.  At the conclusion of this procurement the government shall have use and ownership of a sound and well-designed roof that has an anticipated life cycle of 50 years.   This one time procurement fulfills the Government requirement.  

12.  Certification:I certify that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (i.e. verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate:_____________________________________(Signature)  _____________________ (Date)(Type or Print Name):  __Karen Pittleman_Director, Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts

Previous Information:
Meeting for 5" Rocket Laser Guidance Systems Project.  This notice is being posted under solicitation number N68936-12-R-0062.  The Department of the Navy (DON) is hosting an Industry Day from 0900  1100 on 25 January 2012 with sidebar sessions to be offered after the main session.  The purpose of Industry Day is to disseminate information to the defense industry regarding the government intention to mature the state of the art in 5 Rocket Laser Guidance Systems.

Background:  A USMC Deliberate Universal Need Statement (D-UNS) #10277UA for 5" Rocket Laser Guidance System requests a forward firing, precision guided, low collateral damage weapon for USMC FW TACAIR platforms in order to engage multiple, fleeting, soft targets during CAS missions in OEF.
 It is the intent of the government to collect performance data and provide range and engineering support for suppliers to demonstrate a 5" Rocket Laser Guided weapon. The contractor provided weapons will be ground launched by the Navy at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake. Fly-out and weapon/seeker performance data will be captured by the government and each supplier will be given the data package from their provided weapons launches. Multiple contract awards are planned to obtain weapons performance data.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.   <br><br>PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as "Sensitive but Unclassified" or "For Official Use Only".  <br><br>BACKGROUND:<br>The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.<br><br>INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:<br>1.      Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.  <br>a.       System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.<br>b.      Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.<br>c.       Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.<br>d.      High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).<br>e.       High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.<br>f.       All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.<br>g.      Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.<br>h.      Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.<br><br>2.      Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.<br><br>3.      Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.<br><br>4.      Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training.<br><br>5.      Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battlespace 2 (VBS 2) into the system.<br><br>HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY:<br>Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

<DESC>The applicable contract type for this procurement is Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE). Several factors combined resulted in a decision that a CPFF LOE for the labor requirements would be in the best interest of the Government. The level of effort required to accomplish the tasks identified in the Statement of Work (SOW) contains many uncertainties; and therefore, do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.

<DESC>The applicable contract type for this procurement is Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF). Cost-reimbursement contracts are suitable for use only when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract. Several factors combined resulted in a decision that a CPFF&nbsp;for the labor requirements would be in the best interest of the Government. The level of effort required to accomplish the tasks identified in the Statement of Work (SOW) contains many uncertainties; and therefore, do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.

<p>Incumbent Contracts: Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Launch Capability Bridge <br />Contract (FA8811-11-C-0002)<br />Atlas EELV Launch Service Contract (FA8816-06-C-0004)<br />Delta EELV Launch Service Contract (FA8816-06-C-0005)</p>
<p>Contractor: United Launch Services, LLC<br />P.O. Box 277005<br />Littleton CO 80127</p>
<p>II. Description of Action</p>
<p>The authority for these actions is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(B), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements due to delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>This class Justification and Authorization (J&amp;A) is to authorize sole-source award of contracts to United Launch Services, LLC (ULS) to satisfy EELV-class National Security Space (NSS) launch requirements from Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 to FY17. This J&amp;A provides sole-source authority for two acquisitions until a full-and-open competition is feasible. This includes a contract for FY12 launch services and contract(s) for FY13-17 launch service requirements.</p>
<p>This J&amp;A will enable assured access to space using currently available, high-confidence space launch systems that have repeatedly demonstrated the capability and reliability required to accurately and safely deliver EELV-class National Security Space (NSS) satellites to orbit. Separate actions, not covered by this J&amp;A, will be undertaken during this period to facilitate demonstration and qualification of additional, new space launch systems that will be considered for competitively-awarded space launch contracts when these systems are mature and proven, which is expected in or after FY16.</p>
<p>It is anticipated various contract types will be used, as appropriate. The procurement and production of launch vehicles will be acquired under a Firm Fixed Price construct and the launch capability and other support functions may be acquired under a Cost-Plus type construct.</p>
<p><br />III. Description of Supplies/Services</p>
<p>Under the contemplated contracts, the Air Force will continue to acquire critical services necessary to satisfy U.S. military and intelligence space launch requirements. EELV-class NSS launch requirements include the threshold mass-to-orbit requirements specified in the System Performance Requirements Document (SPRD) for Air Force, Navy, and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) missions. The services provided include, but are not limited to, the following: procurement and production of launch vehicle hardware; mission integration and assurance; program management; systems engineering; transportation of launch system components; launch site operations and support; factory support; essential infrastructure support; and any EELV launch-related special studies.</p>
<p>The total estimated dollar value of all contracts within this class J&amp;A is estimated to be $19B with procurement funds and a limited amount of research and development funds. The total period of performance of the contracts authorized by this J&amp;A will be from contract award until the completion of the FY17 requirement. Therefore, the anticipated period of performance is expected to be from FY12 to FY19 for all contracts.</p>
<p>IV. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>The statutory authority of this action is contracting by Other than Full and Open Competition, 10 USC &sect; 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B). FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) states, "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for." Subparagraph (iii) goes on to state, "Services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in--"; subparagraph (B) "Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements."</p>
<p>V. Applicability of Authority</p>
<p>Sole source authorization for EELV-class national security missions launch services is necessary beginning in FY12 to assure U.S. access to space, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect;2273 and National Space Policy (June 28, 2010). Currently the U.S. has several vital satellite constellations for position and navigation, communication, missile warning, nuclear detection, weather, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance with aging satellites in need of constellation sustainment and resiliency. The inability to launch will delay the operational use of a spacecraft thereby reducing multiple constellations' operational availability and potentially endanger constellation health. This will reduce or preclude the ability of the warfighter to accomplish specific missions which utilize satellite systems such as Global Positioning System (GPS), Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS), Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), and other national assets. Significant launch delays will also impact other non-defense users such as transportation, agricultural, and financial sectors.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(A)(2)(iii)(B), full and open competition need not be pursued when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements, in particular, for the continuation of highly-specialized services. EELV launch services require 98% reliability due to the high dollar value and national importance of the payloads aboard the rockets. This effort requires mechanical, electromagnetic, environmental, and other specialized engineering disciplines necessary for controlled explosions and remote controlled operations in dynamic space environments to insert spacecraft into orbit as well as considerable capital investments to provide these services. As explained below, ULS is currently the only launch provider that can meet the requirements for EELV-class NSS missions and has provided these services to the Government since 2006. In addition, the launch services provided by ULS have a proven record of successful launches since 2002.</p>
<p>Through market research, discussed in Section VIII, the Government determined no source other than ULS is capable of meeting the SPRD requirements until FY16. It would be an inefficient use of Government resources to hold a competitive source selection before a new entrant (a contractor other than ULS) has fully demonstrated they can meet the SPRD requirements. Based on this, it is expected RFP release can occur no earlier than FY16. As illustrated in the timeline below, a competitively awarded contract would not occur until FY18. This will cause an unacceptable delay in meeting mission requirements identified in FY12 - FY17. Therefore, this J&amp;A must cover the launch service requirement ordering period of FY12 through FY17 to ensure there is no lapse in launch service coverage.</p>
<p>Activity: Anticipated Timeline:<br />New Entrant Available for Competition - Earliest Anticipated FY16 <br />RFP Release FY16<br />Source Selection 1QFY17 - 4QFY17<br />Contract Award 1QFY18<br />First Launch Under Competitively Awarded Contract 1QFY20</p>
<p><br />VI. Efforts to Obtain Competition</p>
<p>In order to determine potential offerors, a Request for Information (RFI) was posted to the Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOps) website in May 2011. The Government received and evaluated responses from ULS, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), Orbital Science Corporation (Orbital), and ATK Aerospace Systems (ATK). The Government also performed site visits at the respective contractors' facilities. The purpose of the RFI was to "seek information from domestic launch services providers that will enhance the Government's understanding of industry capabilities for providing EELV-class space launch services for national security space missions" and to "determine available sources in addition to the existing provider that will be capable of satisfying EELV-class NSS launch requirements from both Vandenberg AFB (VAFB) and Cape Canaveral AFS (CCAFS) starting no later than FY15 (for launch services to be ordered beginning as early as FY13)." The RFI was released as part of the market research effort for the FY13 buy but it was determined it is relevant and applicable to the FY12 requirements.</p>
<p>Interested sources were asked to submit information on launch systems that met or exceeded the requirements identified in the EELV SPRD. The Statement of Capability areas that were evaluated were the (1) ability to meet the requirements of the EELV SPRD; (2) design maturity, development, and qualification activities; manufacturing process quality; flight worthiness of the systems and subsystems; and the supporting non-recurring and recurring processes; and 3) business operations.</p>
<p>The Government intends to promote future competition in the EELV program; however, competition for EELV contract awards cannot begin until the SMC Commander certifies a potential EELV contractor can meet EELV-class mission requirements as described in the Air Force New Entrant Certification Guide, dated 7 November 2011. As further discussed in Section VIII, the Government's evaluation of the responses and additional market research concluded that ULS is the only provider capable of meeting the NSS EELV-class launch requirements from FY12 through FY16. Given the acquisition cycle, sole-source authority is necessary through FY17 to allow time for a competition once a New Entrant demonstrates they can meet the requirements of the SPRD. Additional efforts to foster competition are described in Section XI.</p>
<p>VII. Fair and Reasonable Costs</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer anticipates the cost for this effort will be considered fair and reasonable. <br />The contractor will bear the burden of submitting detailed, certified cost or pricing data with their initial proposal and for any future contract changes greater than $700,000.00, in accordance with FAR 15.403-4 - Require Cost or Pricing Data (10 U.S.C. &sect; 2306a and 41 U.S.C. &sect; 254b). <br />Subsequent to technical and cost evaluations of contractor proposals by the Government team, the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) will make a determination as to whether the cost is fair and reasonable, and document the basis for that determination. The PCO will determine reasonableness based on review and reconciliation of all sources of information, including, but not limited to: Audit Reports from the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) recommendations, EELV Program Office technical evaluations, and past history/performance. The SMC pricing evaluations will be supported by DCMA and DCAA teams at the contractor's facilities.</p>
<p>VIII. Market Research</p>
<p>As mentioned in Section VI and in accordance with FAR Part 10, the Government conducted market research to determine if additional sources existed that are capable of satisfying EELV system requirements for launch services ordered as early as FY12.</p>
<p>a. (ATK)</p>
<p>b. (Orbital)</p>
<p>c. (SpaceX)</p>
<p>d. ULS</p>
<p>Based on the market research performed to date, ULS is currently the only source that meets the EELV SPRD requirements and will be the only capable source until at least FY16.</p>
<p>IX. Other Facts:</p>
<p>None</p>
<p>X. Interested Sources</p>
<p>The Government received responses to the RFI posted on the FedBizOps website on 6 May 2011 from ULS, SpaceX, Orbital, and ATK. Responses were evaluated based on the information that was provided to the Government by the contractors. Each company was judged in terms of capability in three main areas to determine an overall assessment. The results of the Government review are discussed in Section VIII.</p>
<p>XI. Steps to Foster Competition</p>
<p>National Space Policy (June 28, 2010) directs agencies to continue to "develop launch systems and technologies necessary to assure and sustain future reliable and efficient access to space." The Government is committed to encouraging competition for NSS launch services in order to provide flexibility to maintain access to space and reduce program costs. The Air Force, NRO, and NASA have adopted a joint New Entrant Certification Strategy, dated 27 October 2011, which provides a methodology for certification of launch vehicles based on risk classifications for individual payloads. This framework provides multiple paths to on-ramp potential New Entrants. In addition, the 7 Nov 11 New Entrant Certification Guide details the certification requirements for New Entrants.</p>
<p>Each agency will establish and assign payload classification levels for its respective payloads. These payload classifications will define a hierarchy of risk combinations by considering such factors as mission criticality, payload complexity, magnitude of investment, and other relevant factors. On the launch services side, new-entrant launch vehicles will be assessed and certified in accordance with a launch vehicle certification requirements matrix, which assigns levels of risk in launch vehicle system (high, medium, or low) based on several relevant characteristics, including vehicle maturity and flight experience in EELV-class mission configurations.</p>
<p>Potential EELV-class NSS mission providers and other launch providers will have the opportunity to compete for pre-certification launches. Any New Entrant seeking certification will be evaluated based upon the requirements specified in the New Entrant Certification Guide.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates implementing full-and-open competition for the follow-on contract actions for FY18-FY22 and FY23-FY30, provided another vendor is certified for EELV-class NSS launches. The desired end state is ability to leverage alternative space launch provider(s) (New Entrants) in a competitive environment as soon as feasible while assuring the first priority of overall mission success.</p>
<p>XII. Contracting Officer's Certification</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's signature on the Justification Review Document is evidence that she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of her knowledge and belief. (FAR 6.303-2(b))</p>
<p>XIII. Technical/Requirements Personnel's Certification</p>
<p>As evidenced by the signature on the Coordination and Approval Document/Justification Review Document, the Program Manager certified that any supporting data contained herein is both accurate and complete. The Program Manager for this effort is responsible for verifying the technical requirement for this effort.</p>
