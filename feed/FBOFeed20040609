B. Full text of announcement 
The Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for COORDINATORs, a new program to develop software coordination managers that provide coordination support to fielded human units, e.g., tactical teams.  In addition to this BAA and before submitting proposals, a prospective offeror MUST refer to the COORDINATORs Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) located at the DARPA website, http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicitations/solicitations.htm for further information. The COORDINATORs PIP contains additional details on the program objectives, application space, program description, evaluation plans and metrics, program scope, general information, submission process, reporting requirements and procedures, proposal format, evaluation and funding processes, and administrative addresses.

I.  Funding Opportunity Description 

PROGRAM SCOPE DARPA. 
The goal of COORDINATORs is to help fielded human units (e.g., soldiers, tactical teams) adapt their mission plans online in response to change.  Coordination support will enable fielded units to respond more rapidly and more accurately to the dynamics of the situation while incurring less cognitive load and performing with a greater degree of coordinated action.  

There are five primary technical areas in this program:  distributed activity coordination, context-dependent coordination autonomy, machine learning, organizational reasoning, and meta-cognition.  Hard research problems include distributed coordination over large interconnected mission structures that change dynamically, supporting coordination of large-scale operations where units may have roles in multiple missions, learning to support the units better by automating decision making when data is potentially sparse, responding in (fast enough) “real time” to change, and reasoning about military decision-making policies and procedures during coordination.

Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art. Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered. However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in minor evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on special-purpose systems or narrow applications.

II. Award Information 
The program consists of four tasks: 1) technical, 2) testbed development, 3) centralized optimal coordination tool development, 4) scenario development.  The government anticipates multiple awards for the technical task, a single award for the testbed task, a single award for constructing the optimal centralized coordination tool, and a single award for scenario development.

The program is expected to have four 12 month phases.  Proposers should address all phases but the level of detail for Phases I and II should be somewhat greater than that for other phases.  Initial funding will be for Phase I only.  Funding will occur in accordance with the phases, i.e., assuming a successful Phase I and available resources. 
The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  Final funding determination will be based on the combination of proposed approaches which will reasonably support program success. Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.


III. Eligibility Information
1.  Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.
This BAA addresses four tasks for the COORDINATORs program.  While the proposer may bid on more than one task, separate proposals are required for each.  If the proposer chooses to bid for multiple tasks and Task I is part of that mix, then the proposer must articulate how the organization will establish firewall procedures to preclude conflict of interest issues and must describe the firewall procedures in its proposals.
Awards made under this BAA may be subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 2.101, must be disclosed in Section II, I. of the proposal, organized by task and year.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict.  
2.  Cost Sharing or Matching
Cost sharing is not required for this particular program; however, cost sharing will be carefully considered where there is an applicable statutory condition relating to the selected funding instrument (e.g., for any Technology Investment Agreement under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371). 

IV. Application and Submission Information

1.  Address to Request Application Package

This announcement contains all information required to submit a proposal.  No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.  [NOTE:  See paragraph 6, “Other Submission Requirements,” for reference to the PIP.]

2.  Content and Form of Application Submission
This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) requires completion of a BAA Cover Sheet for each Proposal prior to submission.  This cover sheet can be accessed at the following URL:
http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=04-29

After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to every copy.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of the Proposal.  If a proposer intends to submit more than one Proposal, a unique UserId and password must be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.
Security classification guidance on a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award.  If you choose to submit a classified proposal you must first receive the permission of the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA.  
REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES:  The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/IPTO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be submitted electronically via the DARPA/IPTO Technical-Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government-furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).
PROPOSAL FORMAT
Proposers must submit an original and 2 copies of the full proposal (3 total) and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk, 100 MB Iomega Zip disk or cd).  Mac-formatted disks will not be accepted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 04-29, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy number of 2.  
3.  Submission Dates and Times
The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON (ET) Monday August 23, 2004, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 04-29, COORDINATORs will remain open until 12:00 NOON (ET) Wednesday, June 1, 2005. Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Wednesday, June 1, 2005. While the proposals submitted after the Monday August 23, 2004, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  DARPA will acknowledge receipt of submissions and assign control numbers that should be used in all further correspondence regarding proposals.

4.  Intergovernmental Review – N/A
5.  Funding Restrictions
Authorization of precontract costs will be considered  in situations of genuine urgency where programmatic benefits will accrue from their use.
6.  Other Submission Requirements
Proposers must obtain the BAA 04-29  Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and proposal formats.  This pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/solicitations.htm.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 04-29  PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.

V. Application Review Information

1.  Criteria (listed in descending order of relative importance): 

(1)	Overall Scientific and Technical Merit: The overall scientific and technical merit must be clearly identifiable and compelling. The technical concepts should be clearly defined and developed. The technical approach must be sufficiently detailed to support the proposed concepts and technical claims.  Evaluation will also consider the effectiveness of the system integration and management plan.
 (2)	Innovative Technical Solution to the Problem:  Offerors should apply new and/or existing technology in an innovative way that supports the objectives of the proposed effort.   The proposed concepts and systems should show breadth of innovation across all the dimensions of the proposed solution.  Offerors must also specify quantitative experimental methods and metrics for measuring progress of the effort.
 (3)	Potential Contribution and Relevance to DARPA/IPTO Mission:  The offeror must clearly address how the proposed effort will meet the goals of the undertaking and how the proposed effort contributes to significant advances to DARPA/IPTO.  
(4)	Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience:  The qualifications, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principals and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations must be clearly shown.
 (5)	Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition:  The offeror should provide a clear strategy and plan for transition to military forces (and commercial sector, where applicable).  Offerors should consider involving potential military transition partners, as appropriate, in any proposed experiments, tests and demonstrations.  Offerors should also provide a plan for transition of appropriate technology components and information to the user community.
 (6)	Cost Realism:  The overall estimated costs should be clearly justified and appropriate for the technical complexity of the effort.  Evaluation will consider the value of the research to the government and the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed.
2.  Review and Selection Process
It is the policy of DARPA to ensure impartial, equitable, comprehensive evaluation of all proposals and to select the source (or sources) whose offer meets the Government’s technical and policy goals.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal, using the above criteria.

Proposals will not be evaluated against each other, since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.  DARPA's intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons.
  
Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled for administrative purposes by support contractors.  These support contractors are prohibited from competition in DARPA technical research and are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are also bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  However, non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.   Use of non-government personnel is covered in FAR 37.203(d).


VI. Award Information Administration

1.  Award Notices

Principal Investigators will receive a letter informing them of the disposition of their proposal via U.S. mail.  

2.  Administrative and National Policy Requirements

Proposers may wish to visit DARPA’s Contracts Management Office (CMO) website (http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/modelgrantagreement.htm) for model grant and cooperative agreement terms and conditions.

3.  Reporting

Post-award reporting requirements are set forth in Section B.I, Funding Opportunity Description.  Additional details are contained in the Proposer Information Pamphlet.  The DARPA/CMO website referenced above also provides general information about reports required specifically for grants and cooperative agreements.

<DESC>DARPA's Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) Office is soliciting ideas that will help achieve its objectives to develop and demonstrate unmanned air combat capabilities for high-threat combat missions and environments, including the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), Surveillance/Reconnaissance, precision strike and other related missions, being conducted within the emerging global command and control architecture.   Such ideas can range from modest hardware and or software component projects to major subsystems developments. Enabling system level technology areas of interest encompass advanced sensors; digital wireless communications, including networks; information processing and integration; intelligent algorithms and related software for mission management, data fusion, image registration, targeting, and other system level functions; digital avionics; and other areas that can improve or enhance system capabilities.  Unmanned air vehicle platform technologies, including those that impact vehicle management, survivability, and  platform performance, including enhanced propulsion, also fall within the scope of this solicitation.  Additional ideas of specific interest to the J-UCAS Office for near term application include automated air refueling, avionics performance and reliability enhancement technologies (e.g. spray cooling), advanced flight stability and control, and other technologies to reduce weight and cost.  Proposals should fall within the general scope of the topics described herein and extend the state of the art in order to be considered acceptable.  The J-UCAS Office's goal for this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to solicit revolutionary research and development that will support its Office mission.  Such efforts may involve high technical risks, which if enabled would provide commensurate high payoffs.  Offerors should initially be prepared to support the technical feasibility of their concept or idea, and then be prepared to demonstrate and discuss successive phases leading toward technology development and integration with J-UCAS system elements.  As such, proposals should include a base effort supporting the technical feasibility of the offeror's concept or idea and pre-priced options or subsequent phases that further lead toward technology development with a clearly defined roadmap for transition to an operational capability.  It is envisioned that the base effort proposed will not exceed 12 months, and each successive phase or option proposed will not exceed 12 months.  Note that exercise of any option is incumbent upon the continued success of the research and availability of funding.  This announcement and the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) constitute DARPA's solicitation for this BAA.  Proposers must obtain the BAA04-24 PIP which provides further technical and administrative detail for this BAA including technologies of interest, evaluation criteria, funding processes, and formats of white papers and proposals.  Proposals not meeting the specified format described in the PIP will not be considered for award.  The Government shall not be liable for the cost of proposal preparation and submission.  Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with this announcement and the PIP.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offerors should be alert for any amendments to this BAA.  Questions regarding this BAA or comments on the PIP may be sent to BAA04-24@darpa.mil.

Tasks for this acquisition require detailed knowledge of the Pioneer System design, since production drawings are not available.  Accordingly, as the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the Pioneer UAV, PUI is the only firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and understanding of the Pioneer design and system architecture.  Award to any one other than PUI would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Navy's requirements.  The estimated period of performance is August 2004 to August 2006.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Responses to this notice can be sent via email directly to Michael.Mcloughlin@navy.mil.

Procurements under the BOA will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the purchase of 300 RTSX-S series, RT54SX32SCQ208B Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices, for NASA independent testing.  NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Actel Corporation, for the following reasons: (a) There have been a number of reported and confirmed failures in these devices in both NASA and Department of Defense applications. Actel has developed a new programming algorithm which is believed to mitigate and perhaps eliminate the presence of sensitive outlier devices. (b) Actel is uniquely qualified for this acquisition, since they are the sole manufacturer of this part, and there are no compatible substitute components available. The Actel components are designed and installed in the vast majority of NASA spacecraft, and representative samples of Actel devices are required for component level testing. (c) These components are manufactured by a single vendor, which is Actel, and no qualified alternatives exist. Market research was not conducted, since substitute components are not suitable for an evaluation of NASA flight hardware, which uses Actel parts.  (d) Representative Actel samples must be used for the NASA independent test effort. No other vendor is currently making form, fit, function, and performance compatible substitutes for the SX-S series devices that would yield test results that have significance to NASA missions that have designed in the SX-S series FPGAs. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. The Authority is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 23, 2004. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Leica is the only manufacturer that offers fully morotized zoom capability so that motion can be controlled via PC, multi-focal depth imaging, and auto-mosaic capabilities.  Meyer Instruments is the only authorized regional distributor of Leica products for the Houston area.  Also, the In-Focus Automation for Image-Pro 5.0, intended for use with Leica microscopes, provides capability to automatically step, image, and store digital images of each scanned field-of-view and combine all of these images into one large image.  This capability was developed by Meyer Instruments and is not available on any other microscope system today. (2)Current microscopes at JSC are Leica brand and JSC possesses several sets of eyepieces, low-objectives, light-pipe extensions, bridge extensions, and other accessory pieces for Leica microscopes.  Other microscope brands are not compatible or exchangeable with the existing Leica microscopic components.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The following is an INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT. It constitutes the only written announcement. Under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, the Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and award a contract using FAR Part 15 Negotiated Procurement Procedures to one source without full and open competition. As justified below, there are no other vendors who can provide the required expertise or have the knowledge base regarding this customized software program to satisfy agency requirements within the required time frame for completion of the work. This requirement is not a recurring one, but is only for completion of an existing project.  The contract period of performance shall be for four months.  The contract will also include one two-month option period that may be exercised if efforts are not completed during the base period. If additional work is necessary in support of this program beyond December 31, 2004, then it shall be conducted as a new requirement under the ITS-ESE EPA Contract.  Transitional efforts will occur during the two-month option period.. SAIC has been the sole contractor performing maintenance of EPAYS under Contract No. 68-W1-0055, Delivery Order 36, and under Contract No. 68-W-99-002, Task Order 002.   Today, there are more than 20,000 employee master records in the EPA Master File.  Over 400 reports are generated by EPAYS.  The system contains over 700 major program modules and a total volume of code in excess of 300,000 lines.   In addition, OCFO has been implementing the payroll replacement system with a customized version of the PeopleSoft Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) product, PeoplePlus (PPL).  To date, PPL has not been fully implemented at EPA. In anticipation of the upcoming transition to PPL, OCFO requires the support of SAIC to conclude efforts expended under the expiring EPAYS system.  has the SAIC EPAYS support staff was reduced by 50%.  This staff was to maintain the ongoing needs of operating EPAYS until such time as PPL was live.  At this point, the tasks were to focus on the post-go-live activities.   Due to the delays in implementation the post go-live work has yet to begin.  Until PPL is live, EPAYS will continue to be the system of choice for paying EPA employees.  Post go-live it is planned for EPAYS data to be converted to another platform for use in the future.  Activities to migrate this data have not begun because the reduced staff is consumed by the continuing operation of the payroll system itself.  Once the operation activity stops, the W2 and Retirement System Modernization (RSM) closeout processes must occur.  The RSM is newly imposed requirement for retirement data transmission to OPM.  Plans were not made to migrate this data into PPL and EPAYS remains the sole repository for this information.  The current SAIC assigned personnel have a thorough and in-depth understanding, as well as a historical knowledge, of EPAYS and its support systems.  SAIC employees have unique capabilities associated with understanding the different characteristics and nuances of the EPAYS system.   Historically, newly assigned but experienced SAIC developers have taken several months to learn the functionality, programming, and structure of EPAYS and its support systems. The expense of training and bringing a new contractor up to speed would be cost prohibitive due to imminent system replacement.  Furthermore, the introduction of a new contractor would have a devastating impact on this progress due to the possibility of the new contractor either not understanding the prior progress and planning - thus, negating any prior progress made and potentially backtracking before any new progress is made.   THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS OF ONLY ONE SOURCE, SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, 1213 JEFFERSON DAVIS HWY, ARLINGTON VA 22202, CAPABLE OF FULFILLING THE REQUIREMENT. The NAICS Code is 541519 with a Small Business Size Standard $21 M. The tasks to be performed include 1) initial project plan development, 2) maintain project plan, 3) revise project plan, 4) manage the project, 5) close-out the project, 6) transition of requirement, 7) perfective maintenance for regulatory/user requirements, 8) retirement system maintenance, 9) monitor and support bi-weekly production cycle, 10) maintain production control activities on a daily basis, 11) disaster recovery tests an drills, 12) modify and maintain the focus production report run process, 13) collect historical data.  Deliverables include 1) Project Plan, 2) Updated Project Plan, 3) Revised Project Plan, 4) Documentation of CCD Minutes, 5) Monthly Technical and Financial Reports, 6) Transition Plan, 7) Modified Software Code, 8) Installed Software Code, 9) EPAYS Hotline Support, 10) Final System/Software Analysis Reports, 11) Mainframe TIMS Entries, 12) Production Run Status Report, 13) Mainframe Production Nightly Job Runs, 14) Status Report on run, balance payroll @ DDS, 15) Modified Production Run Report, 16) Historical Data Electronic File.  These tasks and deliverables involve the EPAYS System, ?Core' PL/1 Sustem, ?TAPP' ADABAS/NATURAL Front End Data Collection System, System Interfaces, ENDEVOR Configuration Management, FOCUS and SAS Reporting Subsystem, and shall address required Systems Documentation, NTSD Operational Policies, Tracking and Installation Management System, Personnel/Payroll Reporting System, Office of Civil Right System, and the Focus Users Security System.

<CONTACT>JOHN M. SOUTHERLAND, Contract Specialist, Phone: (919)541-3416, E-Mail: southerland.john@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement for Quantitative Transport Bias Analysis (QTBA) Hybrid Recptor Model Development.  The QTBA model requires updating and enhancement for application to the STN PM2.5 data and source contribution estimates from receptor models.  The HY-SPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectories) model developed by NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory (Draxler, 1997) can provide advanced back-trajectory input data for QTBA.  In addition, output from meteorological models such as the Eta Data Assimilation System (EDAS) are being archived at higher spatial and temporal resolution, allowing for improved trajectory calculations.  The QTBA model algorithms need to be refined to take advantage of contemporary trajectory and meteorological data, and to provide improved estimates of trajectory uncertainties for region-scale source area identification.  Further model development is also needed to account for the complexity of source contributions for urban monitoring sites.  The QTBA model could be improved to better distinguish local from regional source impacts by reducing the model domain and grid size from the current regional-scale domain comprised of the entire eastern U.S.  Higher resolution trajectory data using fine-scale meteorological model output would also be required to allow enough spatial resolution for QTBA to quantify local source impacts. Therefore, the main purpose of this contract is to update and enhance the existing QTBA hybrid receptor model that incorporates trajectory uncertainties in estimates of source area contributions. An improved QTBA model will allow EPA and State and Local air pollution control agencies to more accurately identify and quantify regional-scale source areas contributing to PM concentrations at STN and IMPROVE network sites.  Optional tasks are included to provide a larger database of back-trajectory data for STN sites, a website for QTBA model user access to the trajectory database, and additional refinement of the QTBA model to provide capability for identifying source areas at the urban-scale. EPA anticipates the award of a fixed price contract.  NAICS Code 541690 applies with a small business size standard of $5M in average annual receipts over the last three years.  A Draft copy of the Statement of Work  (SOW) will be posted on website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/.   A copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP) with SOW will be posted on or about the date the RFP is issued.  Any supporting documentation and/or relevant information (if applicable) concerning this procurement will be posted on website:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/.  The RFP is expected to be issued approximately on July 12, 2004 as full and open competition.  Proposals will be due approximately 30 calendar days after issuance of the RFP and it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the RFP is posted for any amendments.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The US Environmental Protection Agency, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13, and in accordance with FAR Part 12, intends to issue a purchase order for a Particle Size Analysis System required by the National Enforcement  Investigations Center (NEIC).   The mission of the U.S. EPA's National Enforcement Investigations Center (NEIC) is to support the enforcement of environmental statutes and the clean-up of contaminated sites.  To provide the necessary support for these activities, the NEIC is required to conduct a  wide variety of analytical techniques to characterize as many varieties of materials as possible.  Because environmental contamination and contamination source identification involve a countless variety of materials and a wide range of sample matrices and sample sizes, the NEIC's analytical  capabilities must be as comprehensive and flexible as possible.  Therefore, the specifications required by the NEIC for a particle size analysis system must also be as comprehensive and flexible as possible for NEIC to fulfill its mission.  The NEIC requires a system with the following  specifications to meet its objectives: (1) The particle size analysis system must measure the particle size range of 0.02 to 2000 micrometers in one millisecond or less (1000 scans/second); employ two light sources including a HeNe gas and a blue solid state laser; employ an algorithm made up of a  single uniform theory using angular light scattering technology and full Mie theory over the particle size range given above; and have a modular design with all sampler accessories external to the optical bench for changeover in less than 30 seconds. (2) The particle size analysis system must have  an automated sample dispersion unit with a capacity of 800 ml or greater; an internal ultrasonic probe with variable power and duration settings; and the capability of direct attachment to a liquid source, allowing automatic software control of draining, rinsing, and filling between samples. (3)  The particle size analysis system must have a dry powder sampler with air pressure that is software controlled, measured, recorded, and continuously variable from 0 to 4 Bar pressure.   (4) The particle size analysis system must have a small volume sample capability of 18 ml or less with a  temperature sensor; control of sample temperature by a circulating constant temperature bath; an internal ultrasonic probe with variable power and duration settings for applying dispersion energy during measurement; and the capability to pump sample particles through a dispersion cell, allowing  free flow of magnetic particles and suspension of larger or denser particles.	 Interested parties must submit a quote with warranty information and a FOB Destination Denver, Colorado 80225 price for a particle size analysis system that meets or exceeds the aforementioned specifications.   Quotes  will be evaluated in accordance with the following: All system components shall be purchased from a single vendor.  The basis for selection is Best Value to the Government; in this procurement, Technical quality (meets or exceeds RFQ requirements) and Price will be considered.  The Government  reserves the right to require a vendor to submit further information during the evaluation period demonstrating that its system meets or exceeds the specifications.   Responses to this RFQ must be in writing.  The email address for Point of Contact is schermerhorn.tiffany@epa.gov, and the fax  number is (202) 565-2554.  Quotes will be accepted via email, fax, or at the following hand-carried or courier address: USEPA Headquarters, Attn: Tiffany Schermerhorn (202) 564-9902, 6th Floor Bid and Proposal Room, Ronald Reagan Building, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC, 20004.  No  quotes sent via USPS will be accepted as EPA mail is still being irradiated and is not received timely.

<DESC>The IRS intends to award a sole source contract to ChemImage Corp. (Pittsburgh, PA) for the acquisition of one (1) CONDOR Macro Fluorescence/Visible and Near-Infrared Reflectance Chemical Imaging System for the IRS National Forensic Laboratory to analyze and examine questioned documentation submitted to the Lab.  The Ink and Paper Chemistry Section of the Lab routinely analyzes writing inks on paper to determine whether two (2) or more inks are of the same or different formulation and to determine whether the ink was in existence when a suspected fraudulent document was purportedly prepared.  The current procedure in use is a chemical technique to differentiate and identify writing inks and is a destrictive one.  Writing inks have different chemical compositions, which have different absorption/reflectance properties.  These differences are easily visualized in a chemical image and are characterized with the spectral information of the image.  Chemical imaging is a non-destructive technique which separates an image into its component colors in a quantitative manner at many different wavelengths.  This allows for the non-destructive differentiation of the components contained in writing inks.  Chemical imaging allows the chemical information of material to be displayed in images, as well as spectra, making the results of technical information easier to illustrate to a lay juror.  The CONDOR Macro Fluorescence/Visible and Near-Infrared Reflectance Chemical Imaging System meets the requirements of the Lab and will allow it to remain technologically current with advances in the forensic science field.

Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement IN WRITING ONLY.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED, ONLY WRITTEN REQUESTS.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The IRS intends to award a sole source contract to Renishaw, Inc (Hoffman Estates, IL) for the acquisition of one (1) Micro-Raman Spectroscopy System for the IRS National Forensic Laboratory.  This three (3) laser system will allow the IRS Lab to analyze the chemical components in writing ink, copier toner and paper submitted to the Lab.  Currently, the Chemistry Section of the Lab utilizes an analytical technique called "thin layer chromatography" (TLC).  TLC, a destructive technique, is used for separation and comparison of the visible and fluorescent components contained in writing ink during the examination of suspected fraudulent documents.  At this time, the Lab only conducts visual examinations on copier toner and papers.  The acquisition of the Micro-Raman Spectroscopy System will allow the Lab to perform in situ, non-destructive testing on writing ink, copier toner and paper.  The Renishaw Micro-Raman Spectroscopy System meets the requirements of the Lab and will allow it to remain technologically current with advances in the forensic science field.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>TACOM-Picatinny has a requirement for conducting microscopy analysis on ballistic material fragments.  The technical elements of the work to be performed by the contractor are as follows: The objective of this effort is to investigate effects of pre-existing microstructure/ defect substructures on deformation and failure mechanisms of tungsten- based penetrator material. Relations between twinning shear localization (shear banding), dynamic recrystallization, cleavage and flow zone will be investigated. Prospects of tungsten cleavage alteration by alloying or impurity content such as oxygen would be studied. Variations in single-crystal crystallographic orientations could confirm verification of flow mechanisms/hypothesis. Specific research approaches and analyses, which are to be pursued but not necessarily limited to only the following: Microscopic mapping of complete projectile-in-target microstructures using optical metallography, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) where necessary and practical.   Additional, more specific information will be contained within the Request for  Quotation (RFQ), which is anticipated to be released on or about 6/24/04. It is the Government's intention to award this requirement sole source to the University of Texas at El Paso.  Note 5 and 22 apply.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation, W914NS-04-Q-0177, is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This action is unrestricted and provides for full and open competition. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13 and DFARS Change Notice 20020531. The associated NAICS code is 491110. The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), Baghdad, Iraq has a requirement for a Postal Information Management System. Contract Line Item (CLIN) 0001 must be delivered 180 days ARO (see FAR 52.211-9 below) to the Iraqi Postmaster General, Baghdad Central Postal Facility and four other Central Post Offices throughout Iraq. Description and specification requirements are: CLIN 0001 – Postal Information Management System i.a.w. Attachment 1, Statement of Work (SOW): 1 Ea. $________________. See attached file (Attachment 1) for SOW. Evaluation: The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on a best value basis, the basis of which consists of technical (capability of the items offered to meet the agency need as listed in the SOW) and price. The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the specification strength and quality in the area of the offeror’s technical proposal. Offerors shall include a detailed product description that highlights specifications and quality. The technical quote will be significantly more important than price. The Government intends to make a single award for the entire system. The price proposals are not rated against standards but will be evaluated for realism, completeness, and reasonableness. It is the Government’s intent to award to an offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the combined synopsis/solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors to represent the best value to the Government. The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Government the greatest confidence that it will meet or exceed the requirements affordably. This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Contracting Officer reasonably determines that the technical superiority and/or overall business approach and/or superior past performance of the higher price offeror outweighs the cost difference. While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the best value selection process, by its nature, is subjective. Professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process. Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient. Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance. Responsibility Determination: Offerors should provide references for a minimum of three of the offeror’s customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of same or similar scope. Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote). The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (NOTE: Include E-mail address and phone number for references!). Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years. The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. The offeror’s record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offeror’s quote. Delivery: Offerors are directed to FAR 52.211-9 on how they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements as follows: 52.211-9 Desired and Required Time of Delivery. DESIRED AND REQUIRED TIME OF DELIVERY (JUNE 1997) (a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule. DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No: CLIN 0001; Quantity: 1 each; 120 DAYS/MONTHS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT. If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offeror’s proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government’s required delivery schedule as follows: REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.: CLIN 0001; Quantity: 1 each; 180 DAYS/MONTHS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT. Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply. OFFEROR’S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.: __________; Quantity: _______; WITHIN _______ DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT. (b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. (End of clause) In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.216-1, Type of Contract, the Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract. Acceptance will be by the Iraqi Postmaster General, Baghdad, Iraq. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items, offerors should submit with their quotation: (1) a price proposal which shows the proposed unit price for each line item and the total overall price for CLIN 0001; (2) supporting information or product literature/specifications for the proposed items that demonstrates a clear understanding of the specifications stated in the SOW but not exceeding the clause at 52.212-1; (3) a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items (MAY 2002), and Alternate I (APR 2002); (4) Contractor’s Duns and Bradstreet (DUNS) number; (5) Contractor’s Cage Code; and (6) an affirmation that it has an active registration on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), which is at the website www.ccr.gov. Note: Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor’s Registration database in order to receive payment, should they receive a Government contract award! The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items, as well as the following instructions: Offerors’ technical proposal (including delivery terms) shall be no longer than thirty pages; however, self-certification pages under 52.212-3 listed below do not count against the limit. Use type characters no smaller that 10 pitch. Offerors’ pricing data shall be no longer than three pages. No attachments are allowed and only the front of a page shall be used. A page that has material on back and front will count as two pages. The contracting officer may determine proposals that deviate from these type-size and page limitations as non-responsive. Offerors shall submit, in English, an original proposal and one copy. The proposal shall be easily segregated between the technical quote and contract line item (CLIN) price, which shall be quoted in US dollars. Both the original and copy may be transmitted via e-mail. The copy of the proposal submitted is for evaluation purposes and shall not bear any logos, trademarks, company names or points of contact information that would identify the Offeror. Compressed or executable files are not permitted. Offers based on Irrevocable Letters of Credit (L/C) will not be considered; these acquisitions are funded with U.S. appropriations which do not allow for L/Cs!

<CONTACT>Ryan Dickover, Contract Specialist (Intern), Phone 757-443-1406, Fax 757-443-1424, Email ryan.dickover@navy.mil
<DESC>The Government intends to procure under full and open competition procedures 11 Handheld Barcode Readers.  The minimum requirements for the readers is as follows: Ruggedized design suitable for warehouse operations (capable of sustaining multiple six foot drops to concrete); IP64 sealing rating; 53 key backlit keyboard (at least provision of all alpha and numeric keys); Lighted 1/4 VGA color display with touchpad; Capable of scanning 3-of-9, UPC linear barcodes and PDF417 2-D barcodes; Linear barcode reading close in and at long distance. Maximum distance of 40 feet; 802.11b RF communication, meeting FPS140 specifications; Data communications by RS232 to host (preferred done through charging base); Microsoft Windows Embedded CE.NET operating system; 64MB RAM / 64MB ROM; Forward scanning, pistol grip, design; No more than 30 ounces total with scanner, battery and radio; Provision of a Software Developer's Kit (SDK) (or Program Developer’s Kit); Imager scan engine capable of capturing digital images in addition to reading barcodes.  
Each unit must be delivered with all standard accessories and peripheral equipment necessary for operation including: Charging cradle; Data cable(s); AC line cord; DC line cord; Battery(s); Power Supply.

Delivery shall be made within 2 weeks after award of the purchase order.  Delivery location is the FISC Norfolk Ocean Terminal Division, Building CEP-201, Norfolk Naval Station, Norfolk VA, 23511.  FOB point is destination.  The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price purchase order. The requiring activity for this requirement is FISC Norfolk, Ocean Terminal Division. When the Request for Quote (RFQ) is issued, it may be downloaded by accessing http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  This office no longer issues hardcopy solicitations.  By submitting a quote, the offeror will be self certifying that neither the principal corporate officials or owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive purchase orders from any Federal Agency.  The RFQ will be issued on or about 8 June 04 with a response date of 14 June 04.  After receipt of the initial quotes and establishment of the competitive range, the Contracting Officer intends to conduct a competitive, anonymous, on-line reverse auction as described in the RFQ.  Submission of a quote, in response to the RFQ, will be considered as consent that the offeror will participate in the auction and that the offeror’s price can be revealed during the reverse auction (however, the offeror itself will remain anonymous).  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price issues with the offerrors at anytime prior to award.  Please direct all questions regarding this requirement via e-mail to the POCs identified in this synopsis.

Note:
 The Government currently intends to purchase future equipment that, in addition to all the capabilities above, will be capable of reading and writing UHF Generation II Electronic Product Code (EPC) tags.  The Government therefore desires that the units procured via this requirement be able to run the same software (minus the EPC module) as the EPC capable scanners purchased in the future to avoid developing two software packages, one for non-EPC readers and one for EPC readers.  Therefore, it is the Government desire that the readers purchased now be of the same family (or use the same SDK routines for communication, scanning, and user interface) as a product which the quoter is developing an EPC-UHF Gen II enabled device.  An integrated EPC reader or an add-on EPC peripheral would be equivalent alternatives.  Note that this is not a minimum requirement but is meant only to inform industry of the government’s intended usage for the readers so that quoters can submit the best possible Handheld Barcode Readers

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to make a change in the Statement of Work and to provide a clarification to the Weapon Specification. Paragraph 3.2 of the Statement of Work states that the Electronic Stress Screening (ESS) on all GCSC shall be conducted with the unit under power at a temperature range of  -20°C to +50°.  The temperature range for ESS testing is changed to 0°C to +50°. The following is only for clarification purposes: WS 33950 is the System Specification for the entire MK 160 MOD 9 Gun Computer System which lists requirements, capabilities, operating states, reliability, etc.  The existing design depicted in technical data package submitted as part of the solicitation is  considered by the government to meet the design requirements and does not require the contractor to conduct additional testing to these design requirements specified in WS-33950 sect ions 3.2.9 through 3.2.16; however the contractor shall comply to the manufacturing processes and safety which would be applicable.     Pages 4-1 through 4-5 of WS 33950 lists testing requirements for a first article unit. Since there is no requirement for a first article unit, testing in this section does not apply.  The contractor shall perform the necessary quality assurance and workmanship testing specified in the Statement of Work for this solicitation including Electronic Stress Screening (paragraph 3.2), the testing, inspection acceptance and quality assurance requirements of paragraph 3.4 and 3.4.1. Packaging, handling and transportation requirements Statement of Work paragraph 3.6 apply.

<DESC>This notice is hereby amended to extend the deadline for responses until June 15, 2004.

It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to acquire on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) a Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement from IntraMalls LLC; 120 Cockeysville Road, Suite 204; Hunt Valley, Maryland 21030, for CIT to use the NIH IntraMall and provide the opportunity to extend the IntraMalls program to other agencies.  The NIH IntraMall represents an innovative, full-service acquisition system that harnesses the power of the Internet to streamline the Federal procurement process for the NIH scientific community.  This pioneering e-commerce acquisition system provides product information, on-line ordering, and sophisticated accounting and budget functions that are all customized for the Federal acquisition community.  The NIH IntraMall is able to satisfy the researcher’s equipment and supply needs while saving time and money with every purchase transaction.  Having been tested and implemented for use in 1998, the NIH IntraMall is currently being used by approximately 13 NIH Institutes/Centers (ICs).  Growth of vendors and products offered by the NIH IntraMall has been considerable, with over 150 vendors and over three million catalogue items currently included.  The NIH IntraMall program has empowered the NIH scientific community to exert direct control over purchases of needed supplies and equipment with a substantial decrease in the administrative processing costs per purchase transaction.  The NIH has partnered with IntraMalls, LLC since 1996 to develop and expand the NIH IntraMall software platform, making it a model for digital end-to-end e-commerce by integrating procurement card-based purchasing and seamless transaction information between buyers and sellers.  The NIH IntraMall includes the following features:  electronic ordering, payment, and automated record keeping; a revolutionary automated reconciliation module; and the integration of each purchase transaction to the NIH legacy accounting system (the NIH Administrative Data Base).  Services provided by the NIH IntraMall software platform developed by IntraMalls LLC include hosting and maintenance of supplier catalogues, online shopping and transaction processing, automated purchase order/funds reconciliation, ad-hoc reporting, and toll-free customer support.  Representing a business-to-government (B2G) solution, the NIH IntraMall program has essentially converted supplier catalogues into convenient procurement vehicles, and performs more efficient managed procurement support services that has enabled NIH to reduce its cost of procurement.  Within the IntraMalls LLC software functionality, the process of procuring through the NIH IntraMall is defined as end-to-end, beginning with comparative shopping and ending with receipt, payment and reconciliation.  The software functionality transcends e-catalog connectivity by tightly integrating shopping and requisitions with the order and payment processing services necessary to fulfill audit purposes.  CIT has a need to establish a Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement with IntraMalls LLC to allow CIT to acquire the same end-to-end, web-based vendor catalogue, order delivery and account reconciliation system services currently being used by other NIH ICs, or to extend the IntraMall program to other agencies.  Specifically, the services will include (1) access to over three million catalogue items from over 150 existing vendors; (2) standardized, searchable electronic catalogues comprised of scientific, office and computer equipment and supplies; (3) catalogue descriptions that include NIH-specific pricing and financial classification codes; (4) complete vendor support including enrollment, training and catalogue formatting services; (5) management of user profile data including purchase card and shipping location data; (6) automated order delivery system for interactive communications and order monitoring; (7) custom built interface for delivery of transaction and billing data directly into the NIH accounting system; including an automated reconciliation function; (8) toll free help desk for users and vendors; and (9) activity reporting for users and NIH IC management.  The software platform used to operate the NIH IntraMall program was developed by and is proprietary to IntraMalls LLC.  The software functionalities provided by IntraMalls LLC in its Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement are unique in their ability to meet all current Federal and NIH documentation requirements for purchase card transactions.  Additionally, IntraMalls LLC’s proprietary software is the only source that provides the ability to integrate purchase transactions from the NIH IntraMall into the existing NIH accounting system (an internally programmed legacy system).  Because of the characteristics of the NIH legacy accounting system and IntraMall LLC’s proprietary ownership of the software integration solution, building a new interface to another e-commerce platform would require a substantial investment of time and effort that would simply duplicate what has been achieved by NIH to date in partnership with IntraMalls LLC.  Additionally, NIH is in the process of replacing its legacy accounting system within the next 24-36 months; therefore, making an additional investment in the legacy system is impractical.  Duplicating the unique software functionalities available from IntraMalls LLC’s proprietary Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement would not be financially prudent.  Finally, if NIH were to compete for a new integration effort, it would immediately lose the important benefits of (1) CIT’s use of the existing NIH IntraMall solution and its labor-saving features developed by IntraMalls LLC; e.g., automated transactions and billing data reconciliations; and (2) the opportunity to extend the IntraMalls program to other agencies.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ).   However, all interested parties may request an RFQ by contacting Lynn Montalvo Furtaw at 301-496-6546.   Sources interested in responding to the RFQ must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above and in the RFQ.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office by June 15, 2004.  Proposals must include pricing information.  All responses received in a timely manner will be considered by the Government. This requirement is being processed for CIT by NIH’s National Library of Medicine (NLM).  NLM Synopsis No. NLM 04-143/LMF shall be cited on all correspondence regarding this announcement.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Lynn Montalvo Furtaw on 301-496-6546 or by email at: montalvl@mail.nlm.nih.gov.

Has the Indian Health Service developed a document and/or associated models that generally depict the business and operations of the health centers/stations and will such documentation be made available for use by the successful offeror? 
Answer:   IHS is mission driven.  There is some general information available about each site as related to services provided.  They are all in healthcare.

13.	The RFQ only states a Desired Start Date. What is the overall Period of Performance?
Answer:	30 days from the date of award.

14.	Will the Government please provide a minimum list of deliverables, deliverable descriptions and a delivery schedule?
Answer:  Am not sure how much more specific this can be at this time

15.	Will the Government please provide the sizing parameters it uses to determine if a facility is small, medium or large?
Answer:  We do not have sizing parameters for this.
	
16.	Is there a government project manager who will be the principal POC for the contractor to validate the information requirements for the web-based survey, facilitate access to business and technical stakeholders, review interim and draft deliverables, among others? 
Answer:  Yes

17.	Is the web-based survey the sole tool that the Government would like the vendor to use in identifying existing IT resources?
Answer:  It is the preferable one, other tools may be considered for what the web based tool cannot do.

18.	Will the web-based survey be hosted on government computers or by the contractor?
Answer:  On the IHS web site

19.	The representative questions on the RFQ are oriented specifically toward the technology side of information systems.  Do you want the survey to also address the computer abilities/literacy of the users?
Answer:  That would be helpful

20.	The RFQ states that Tribal and Urban programs can optionally participate in this survey.  How many potential Tribal and Urban facilities could be participating and what are they?
Answer:  Up to 48

21.	Will participation for IHS sites be mandatory?  If so, will there be a deadline by which they must respond?
Answer:  Yes but there are only 3.

22.	Item 4 called Provided by the Government, states the following “The government shall provide access to the internet/intranet site for purposes of data collection from the web assessments.”  Does this mean that the Vendor who is selected can place their IT survey collection tool on the government internet/intranet site to collect the information for the assessments?
Answer:  They won’t, the IHS will.

23.	Who/what is ITSC?
Answer:  Information Technology Service Center for the Indian Health Service

24.	Does the vendor/contractor need to collect information from each individual program and populate the database?  Or, will the vendor only be responsible for creating a tool to collect this information, so that each program can complete the information on their own?
Answer:  Create the tool, each site will complete, vendor will tabulate

25.	How will the data be collected for a program that does not/cannot participate in completing web-based tool?
Answer: We won’t collect it.

26.	Our understanding of the Statement of Work is that a vendor will create a web based tool and analyze the information collected from various programs.  Is this correct?
Answer:  Yes

27.	What are the exact deliverables?
Answer:  The web based tool and the analysis

28.	What are the Government’s future plans for using this web-based tool/information collected from other programs/vendor analysis and recommendations report?
Answer:  Using it for local and area strategic planning

29.	Is this follow-on from an existing contract?
Answer:  No
	
30.	If the answer above is “Yes”, is there any incumbent?  Can you please identify the incumbent?
Answer:

31.	Standard Form 18, item 1, asked for an assessment of current IT resources, item 3 in the Statement of Work asks for a web-based tool.  Is it the intent of IHS to purchase a web-based software tool for the contractor to utilize in facilitating an assessment strictly online rather than having the contractor conduct onsite assessments?
Answer:  The intent is that the contractor will develop a web based tool for completion by sites and the contractor will aggragate and analyze.

32.	Item 3 in the SOW calls for identifying current technologies operating at each location.  If the assessment is conducted strictly online, there is a possibility that some technologies may be overlooked.  If the assessment is conducted online, will the contractor be held responsible for technologies not identified?
Answer:   No

33.	Does IHS desire to have online assessments audited/validated by conducting an onsite review?
Answer:  Not specifically but it could be included in the proposal

34.	Is the intent of IHS to conduct this entire project online and eliminate all travel?  If travel would be involved, what locations would be involved?
Answer:  There may be one to two meetings (one at the beginning of the project to define specifics and one at the end for the report)

35.	If the presentation to the BAO Executive Committee is to be scheduled in person, please specify what location.
Answer:  Bemidji, MN

36.	Given that participation in the assessment is voluntary, how will the contractor know when the desired level of participation is reached?
Answer:  We will set a date and analyze data received at that date.

37.	Will proposals be accepted via fax and/or email:
Answer:	The RFQ will be accepted either by fax or mail.

38.	Could IHS provide additional information as to the size and scope of the organizations that will participate in the assessment?
Answer:  Limited

39.	Is there an approximate number of known systems either centralized or distributed at the various facilities?
Answer:  No

40.	Would the IHS consider a solution that utilizes the ASP model?
Answer:  Don’t know what this is

41.	Does the IHS anticipate using the tool beyond the 30 day estimated period of performance?
Answer:  The tool will become the IHS property and may be used.  The period of performance is not just 30 days.

42.	Has the IHS establish a page limit for responses to this proposal?
Answer:  No

43.	Does the “Small Business Set-Aside RFQ” mean “exclusively for Small Business” or “preference points in scoring given to Small Business?”
Answer:	This RFQ is exclusively set-aside to small business firms.

44.	Does the web-enable IT survey tool need to reside on the government servers or are they expected to reside on the contractor servers?
Answer:  Government

45.	Are any Bemidji Area IHS sites piloting the IHS-developed electronic medical records system?
Answer:  Not yet

46.	What percentage of current BAO sites currently report data on a voluntary basis to the IHS?
Answer:  90%

47.	What percentage of current BAO sites currently utilizes RPMS?
Answer:  90%

48.	What percentage of current BAO sites currently utilizes RPMS in addition to another practice/clinical management system?
Answer:  25%

49.	Will any site visits to BAO provider sites be expected as part of the planning for the survey tool development?
Answer:   No

50.	What’s the time frame for completing this RFQ?
Answer:	The due date for the RFQ will be June 16, 2004.

51.	Are there any preferred development tools?
Answer:   No

52.	Does the development need to be on-site or can this be performed off-site?
Answer:  Off site

53.	Hosting: Will IHS provide the platform for hosting or it needs to be from the vendor/contractor?
Answer:  IHS

54.	Is there a budget set aside for this RFQ?
Answer:	This is a competitive award in which fair and reasonable pricing will be considered.

<DESC>***********THE CLOSING DATE FOR THIS RFI HAS NOW BEEN EXTENDED TO 12:00 NOON (EASTERN STANDARD TIME) ON JUNE 17, 2004.*************


Request for Information for a Standardized Database Solution for Converting Microsoft Access Databases 

 
1.0	SUBJECT

Request for Information (RFI) for a two phased solution to convert, store, manipulate and report data located in multiple databases/spreadsheets (Microsoft Access, Excel, etc.) into a standardized database, and report data to multiple internal and external TSA stakeholders to be integrated with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Operating Platform located at the data hosting center in St. Louis, Missouri.  The database will support users from multiple departments within TSA. Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on June 4, 2004.  See section 8.0 for further information.


2.0	DESCRIPTION

The Transportation Security Administration, at the request of the Office of Information Technology (OIT), and in support the OIT goals  to design, deploy, maintain and enhance the information technology essential for TSA to protect the Nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people; is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of a standardized, enterprise database solution. 

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

Conceptual technical architecture alternatives for a solution that will:
 
•	Interface with multiple systems (internal and external to TSA) to download required data into a standardized database.
•	Interface with authorized TSA users via a limited number of approved applications to sort and manipulate data located in the standardized database.
&#61599;	Report data in a variety of formats (including MS Excel, HTML, etc.) to TSA Stakeholders. 

3.0	REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for the Standardized Database Solution. TSA requires the conversion of existing operational Access databases to a stable, readily managed, multi-user environment to best support their day-to-day operations. The end state environment required is the target Oracle platform shared by TSA and DHS.  TSA has immediate needs to access and manage critical data during conversion with no operational downtime, and reach the end state Oracle environment in the quickest and most cost-effective manner.  An intermediate database environment would be acceptable while transitioning to Oracle, provided TSA’s data accessibility is not interrupted and this approach meets the business needs of TSA in a cost-effective manner.






TSA’s Office of Information Technology requires the ability to store, manipulate, and report unclassified yet sensitive data.  These capabilities are required short term to quickly support users from multiple departments within TSA using a standard data dictionary.

•	The Standardized Database Solution will eliminate redundant efforts (i.e., less employee time spent developing across the enterprise).
•	The Standardized Database Solution will be hosted in a central location, such as TSA’s hosting center that allows for 24 x 7 support and fault tolerance, depending upon the build, with a dedicated Database Administrator (DBA) to ease management and trouble-shooting of all applications.

TSA’s long term requirements involve the ability to download, store, manipulate, and report mission critical data to multiple internal and external TSA stakeholders.  This solution will:

&#61599;	Interface with multiple systems (internal and external to TSA) to download required data into the standardized DB created in Phase I.
&#61599;	Interface with authorized TSA users via a limited number of approved applications to sort and manipulate data located in the standardized DB created in Phase I.
&#61599;	Report data in a variety of formats (Including Excel, HTML, etc.) to TSA Stakeholders.

Other requirements not directly related to database architecture will be addressed at a later date.  Examples of such requirements include security policies and security management requirements, service level agreements, and other important considerations.

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.


4.0	POSSIBLE NETWORK SOLUTION

The Standardized Database Solution will meet the functional requirements specified above.  The Government is open to alternative concepts for solutions that meet these requirements.  The Government encourages creativity and outside the box thinking in responses to this RFI.  

The following parameters should be considered when developing a solution to TSA’s database conversion and management requirements:
&#61599;	Grouping TSA conversions in order to fully utilize economy of scale.
&#61599;	Eliminating database redundancies in TSA offices to minimize the number of conversions and subsequent data maintenance activities.
&#61599;	A transitional approach, initially converting TSA databases quickly to a less complex but stable multiple user’s environment to satisfy immediate customer needs.
&#61599;	Single server for all TSA conversions to consolidate and organize these databases for more orderly follow-on conversions or add-ons.
&#61599;	A two-phase solution:  
&#61599;	Phase 1- converting unclassified yet sensitive data located in multiple databases/spreadsheets (Microsoft Access, Excel, etc.) into a standardized database at a TSA specified data hosting facility.
&#61599;	Phase 2  - creating a long-term solution to download, store, manipulate, and report mission critical data to multiple internal and external TSA stakeholders.

Accordingly, respondents are encouraged to provide information about any alternatives that can be demonstrated to be immune from the kinds of disruptions described in section 3.0, above.


5.0	SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE 

Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit. 

Section 1 – Conceptual Alternatives 

Briefly describe two or more alternative architecture concepts for the Standardized Database Solution, including the reliability and availability characteristics of the alternatives.  Discuss the capability for the solution to be hosted by a third party. (3-5 pages per alternative with one diagram of the hosting site  identifying the brand/type of equipment that would typically be deployed).

Section 2 – Feasibility Assessment

Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks of penetration.  (1 page per alternative)

Section 3 – Cost and Schedule Estimates

Provide cost estimates for each alternative for 5 and 10-year contract terms for non-recurring and annual recurring costs.  The costs will include required hardware and software purchases, design and development costs, as well as maintenance and operational support needs. Also, discuss cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations (2-3 pages)








Section 4 – Corporate Expertise

Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant.  (There is no suggested page count)

In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach, security requirements, security assurance processes, and any relevant lessons learned (1-2 pages per project).  

Include any comments on the structure of the requirements for a formal RFP response.


Section 5 – Additional Materials

Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussion you deem appropriate.

<DESC>Amendment 2 and SOW Revision 1 have been posted to the DCC-W webpage. NOTE: The RFP date remains unchanged. Interested parties may access all applicable documents at the following site:  http://dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil/services/RFP1.asp Scroll down and select W74V8H-04-R-0029. Follow the directions.   If difficulty exist in accessing the link, use the following link: http://dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil/ On left hand side, click on SERVICES, then on right hand side, under SERVICES FOR BUSINESS PARTNERS, click on RFPS. Scroll down and select W74V8H-04-R-0029.  The following questions were received from an interested party:  Q1.  Please confirm the RFP is in fact small business set-aside, NAICS 541611, $6M size standard.  A1. This is the correct NAICS and size standard. Q2.  For the Cost Proposal, page 2 of 35 -- do we roll up CLINs 0001AA, AB, ...AG and use those aggregated numbers to fill in CLIN 0001's quantity, amount, etc?  Same question for CLINs 0002, 0003, 0004, 0005.  A2. YES.  Q3. Also, please explain the difference between TOT ESTIMATED PRICE and CEILING PRICE for each CLIN -- wouldn't they be the same? A3. See FAR Part 16.6  Q4.  Cost proposal, section L, page 28 of 35, do you envision that all the sample tasks will be actively worked throughout the base period and each of the option periods -- i.e., all 10 tasks running simultaneously for 4+ years? A4. The sample tasks are us ed to provide clarity and specificity to the scope of the anticipated base contract and will be used for evaluation purposes.  After award, individual Task Statements of Work will be developed, as judged necessary by the Government. For purposes of develop ing the cost proposal associated with the 10 sample tasks, you should price out all ten tasks as if they were running simultaneously for the 60 months.   Q5.  On the same page, same paragraph, do you want us to compute a total fee as if this were a CPFF?  A5. This is a T&M contract with loaded labor rates.   Q6.  Do you envision awarding Task Orders for anything other than T&M? A6. No. Q7.  In the SOW, page 3 of 10, Sample Task 3.1 -- NCO/CF, first line -- should one of the words '...of within...' be deleted? A7. Yes.   Q8. Similarly, near the end of paragraph 7.2, page 9 of 10, should one or two of the three words '...by the to...' be deleted?  A8. No.  Insert the word 'contractor' after 'the'.  All changes to the SOW have been incorporated into SOW Revision 1.

<DESC>Contract Specialist POC Sara D. Pines 904-232-2083, Technical Specialist POC Mariano Lezcano 904-232-1852.  This solicitation is unrestricted and is open to all firms regardless of size.  Up to two contracts may be awarded from this solicitation.  Th e contract will be an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity contract for a period of one year from date of award, with  options to extend for two additional years; not to exceed a total of three years.

The primary geographic extent of the assignments includes the Florida, Puerto Rico, U. S. Virgin Islands and the Caribbean area of the Jacksonville District.  Additionally, the contracts may be used to provide services within the geographic boundaries of the South Atlantic Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the geographic bound aries of the Jacksonville District.  Criteria used in allocating task orders among the contracts include performance and quality of deliverables under current task orders, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, specialized experienc e, equitable distribution of the work among the contractors, and other relevant factors.  PROJECT INFORMATION:  Services will include engineering and design services for civil works projects such as preparation of design reports, preparation of engineering  studies, preparation of cost estimates in MCACES Gold format, preparation of design calculations, and preparation of construction plans/specifications suitable for use in competitive bidding processes.  The work will encompass all types of civil works pro jects including environmental restoration; flood control; beach renourishment and erosion control; jettys; navigation (including dredging); bridges; site plan development; paving, grading, and drainage plans; and utility systems design and relocation.  Wor k on some projects may require geotechnical exploration and analysis as well as performing surveys. Factors for Evaluation, in order of priority are:   1. SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE: Firms must clearly demonstrate specialized experience and expertise in the preparation of plans, specifications, various federal reports and studies, design reports, cost estimates, design analysis for al l phases of civil engineering and related work.  Must have  ability to prepare construction drawings and specifications in digital format on magnetic tape and/or compact disk using Bentley Systems three-dimensional MicroStation V8 CADD system with a Window s XP operating system target platform, Bentley Systems INROADS, and INROADS Survey software platforms, construction cost estimates utilizing Government provided MCACES Gold software and preparation of plans and specifications using both English and Metric Standards of Measurement.  2. PAST PERFORMANCE: Firm must demonstrate its past performance in the accomplishment of similar work. Firm must submit  information for current relevant  contracts and subcontracts including the name, address, and telephone numb er of references. (Relevancy is defined in the DOD guide to collection and use of past performance as:  information that has a logical connection with the matter under consideration and applicable time span). Pertinent issues are ability to meet establishe d schedules, ability to accomplish work within budgetary limitations, and quality of the delivered product. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry regarding quality and timeliness of work will be reviewed. Past DOD expe rience data available to the Government through the A-E Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) and information available from other sources, will be utilized for prior performance evaluation. 3.

CAPACITY TO ACCOMPLISH THE WORK IN THE REQUIRED TIME: Firm must have the capacity to commence work within fifteen days after receipt of notification to proceed with a task order and accomplish it in accordance with scheduled completion dates. THE FOLLOWING  SECONDARY CRITERIA WILL BE USED AS TIEBREAKERS, IF NECESSARY:  5. VOLUME OF PAST DOD CONTRACTS AWARDED TO FIRM: Work previously awarded to the firm by DOD will be reviewed with the objective of effecting equitable distribution of contracts among equally q ualified firms.  6.  GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF FIRM RELATIVE TO THE WORKSITE: Location of the firm relative to the worksite (considered the Jacksonville District Office) will be considered provided there is an adequate number of qualified firms for considerat ion.  SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  Firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement and wishing to be considered must submit one copy each of SF 254 and SF 255 for the firm or joint venture and SF 254 for each subcontractor.  In Block 4 of SF 255  list only the office personnel for the office to perform the work which is indicated in Block 3B.  Additional personnel strengths, including consultants and subcontractors, should be indicated parenthetically, and their source clearly identified.

The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense. The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered. (The CCR web site may be accessed at htt p://www.ccr.gov). Small and small disadvantaged firms are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. All interested firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subco ntracts to the maximum practical extent with small and small disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507.   If a large business firm is selected for award, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-1, regarding the requirement for  a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  Of those dollars the large business firm intends to subcontract, the Corps of Engineers target goals for subcontracting are 57.2% to small business concerns; 10.0% to small disadva ntaged business concerns; 10.0% to women-owned small business concerns; 3.0% for SBA HUBZone certified small business concerns; and 3.0% to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.  Large firms should keep these target goals in mind when con sidering qualifications of potential subcontractors and ensure that each proposed subcontractor's socio-economic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications.  An approved small business subcontracting plan will be required prior to award to a large business firm.  The NAICS code is 541330 with a small business size standard of $4,000,000.00   Response to this announcement should be in writing  only; telephone calls and personal visits are discouraged. The required forms shall be submitted to the following address: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CESAJ-EN-T, 701 San Marco Boulevard, Jacksonville, FL 32207-8175. This is not a request for prop osal. Firms are encourage to post their name/address on the web site to facilitate contact between prime contractors, sub-contractors, and firms interested in joint ventures. However, copies of the listings of firms will not be provided. A printout of the listing of interested firms can only be obtained by accessing the announcement at our web page at www.saj.usace.army.mil.

<DESC>Damage Control Trainer

NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division has a requirement for a Damage Control Trainer surface ship vessels, such as generic frigate ships and generic patrol boats for the U.S. Navy Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program with the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF).

The location of the trainer is to be in the King Abdul Aziz Naval Base, Jubail, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The Damage Control Trainer should provide training in the execution of emergency procedures in Damage Control.  
The following are requirements of the Damage Control Trainer:
1.	Simulated ship damage to include real water flooding situations where the students get wet and attempt and succeed in repairing leaks. 
2.	Training in the use of communication and alarm systems, Bandit-Kits, portable submersible pumps, and battle lanterns are used by the trainees to effectively react to the damage situation. 
3.	A classroom is provided where trainees are given preliminary instructions in damage control and is later used to review and critique the trainees' damage control performance. 
4.	An instructor monitors and controls the damage situation from the instructor's console. A closed circuit television system provides a video tape recording of each exercise so that a trainee may reinforce his own learning experience by examining his performance on tape as well as through the actual training exercise. 
5.	A water treatment system continuously filters, chlorinates, heats and circulates the water in which the trainees are immersed. An emergency drain system, which can be controlled by either the instructor or a trainee, is provided to rapidly empty the flooded compartment in the event of any emergency.
6.	Full material support package (MSP).  
7.	One man-year of O&M Contractor Logistics Support after delivery.  The contractor shall use the MSP delivered with the initial procurement of the trainer for the O&M support.  The contractor shall provide support for eight (8) hours per day, five (5) days per week.
8.	An Operator and a Maintainer Training Course with a minimum of 40 hours each.  The Operator course shall include the use of some training scenarios.

<SUBJECT>U -- Geriatric Education Center National Technical Assistance Center
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/Health Resources and Services Administration(HRSA) intends to contract with, on a sole source basis,  the Case Western Reserve University(CWRU), Cleveland, Ohio.  This contract, authorized by Title VII, Section 753(a), of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, is needed to establish a Geriatric Education Centers National Technical Assistance Center (NTAC).  The CWRU is the lead organization for the data management and evaluation task force for the National Association of Geriatric Education Centers.  The CWRU has developed a data management system to provide these services.  Any other organization would require an exorbitant amount of time and funds to reproduce the CWRU data management system.  The CWRU is uniquely capable and has the personnel experience and information systems resources to carry out all of the tasks of this requirement.  This center will serve as the primary focal point to provide technical assistance in the areas of data collection tools, methods, systems and evaluation with a goal to evaluate tertiary outcomes (i.e., the effect of geriatric education and training on patients).  The CWRU is deemed the only responsible source capable of providing the services without a substantial duplication of cost to the Government which would not be expected to be recovered through competition.  This Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition(JOFOC) is processed under the authority in 41 U.S.C. 253(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a solicitation.  A copy of the JOFOC is on file.  

A one(1) year contract with a base year and four(4) one year option periods is planned.   A JOFOC is on file.

The major functional area included in the work is ED's accounts payable activities, including the processing of administrative payment requests for contracts, purchase cards, travel, and Inter-partnering Agency Collections (IPAC) payments.  ED solicited offers for a service provider to make ED payments on-time and to accurately match transactions, to ensure accountability/auditability of payment activity, to ensure system performance meets agreed-upon processing needs, to verify accuracy of charges and receipt of goods or services, to provide timely reconciliations, to provide timely and quality management reports, to provide timely receipt of payment, to ensure accurate amount of payment, to accurately create batch payment files, and to manage Treasury confirmations of payment to ED.  The official end date of the Standard Competition is June 4, 2004.  Solicitation ED-03-R-0015 is, therefore, cancelled.

This action for the Navy JEMPRS ground station has been assigned NAICS code,  336413 and has a size standard of 1,000 employees.  Numbered Notes: 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the  Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the  authority of FAR 6.302-1.

Its purpose is to improve the capabilities of the Government of Colombia (GOC) to protect the Colombian President, Vice President, and Minister of Defense, and the Mayor of Bogota (the capital city of Colombia).  These advisory services and training will be provided in Bogota, Colombia, rather then the traditional U.S.-based protection training, because it is more cost effective and allows larger numbers of GOC protection personnel to receive training in a shorter period of time than can be accomplished in the United States.  

2. Position Description: a VIP Protection Advisor will perform the following basic functions:

A. Provide on-the-spot advisory services to heads of security and shift agents during VIP Protection Operations for the GOC President, Vice President, Minister of Defense, and the Mayor of Bogotá;

D. Knowledge of office procedures and report writing;

E. Ability to work with minimum supervision under strenuous and challenging conditions;

C. In no instance, however, shall the COR be authorized to alter or modify the specifications or the contract terms and conditions or waive the government’s requirement, price, or other terms and conditions, as it is only the contracting officer that can authorize such changes in writing.

6. Guidelines: guidance is provided from the supervisor in the RSO and the COR in the NAS Management Office.  Given the operational setting of Colombia, with its internal conflict, constant physical danger and frequently remote sites where the VIP protection program must conduct operations, the ability to demonstrate great originality, resourcefulness and ingenuity is imperative.   

7. Complexity: a VIP Protection Advisor will advise and assist the RSO and the GOC in all aspects of VIP protection operations. 

8. Scope and Effects: assignments or objectives sought may involve extensive analysis and investigation to detect and resolve problems that impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of future VIP protection operations and programs.

9. Personal Contacts: contacts are with all levels of host-government personnel, particularly in the offices of the President, Vice President, Minister of Defense, and the Mayor of Bogota, and often at the major-to-colonel military ranks.
 
10. Purpose of contacts: the incumbent serves as the RSO liaison with the offices of the president, vice president, minister of defense, and the mayor of Bogota concerning implementation of the training program, and must often employ persuasion, diplomacy and cooperation to achieve and further USG goals.

Its purpose is to improve the capabilities of the Government of Colombia (GOC) to protect the Colombian President, Vice President, and Minister of Defense, and the Mayor of Bogota (the capital city of Colombia).  These advisory services and training will be provided in Bogota, Colombia, rather then the traditional U.S.-based protection training, because it is more cost effective and allows larger numbers of GOC protection personnel to receive training in a shorter period of time than can be accomplished in the United States.  

2. Position Description: a VIP Protection Advisor will perform the following basic functions:

A. Provide on-the-spot advisory services to heads of security and shift agents during VIP Protection Operations for the GOC President, Vice President, Minister of Defense, and the Mayor of Bogotá;

D. Knowledge of office procedures and report writing;

E. Ability to work with minimum supervision under strenuous and challenging conditions;

C. In no instance, however, shall the COR be authorized to alter or modify the specifications or the contract terms and conditions or waive the government’s requirement, price, or other terms and conditions, as it is only the contracting officer that can authorize such changes in writing.

6. Guidelines: guidance is provided from the supervisor in the RSO and the COR in the NAS Management Office.  Given the operational setting of Colombia, with its internal conflict, constant physical danger and frequently remote sites where the VIP protection program must conduct operations, the ability to demonstrate great originality, resourcefulness and ingenuity is imperative.   

7. Complexity: a VIP Protection Advisor will advise and assist the RSO and the GOC in all aspects of VIP protection operations. 

8. Scope and Effects: assignments or objectives sought may involve extensive analysis and investigation to detect and resolve problems that impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of future VIP protection operations and programs.

9. Personal Contacts: contacts are with all levels of host-government personnel, particularly in the offices of the President, Vice President, Minister of Defense, and the Mayor of Bogota, and often at the major-to-colonel military ranks.
 
10. Purpose of contacts: the incumbent serves as the RSO liaison with the offices of the president, vice president, minister of defense, and the mayor of Bogota concerning implementation of the training program, and must often employ persuasion, diplomacy and cooperation to achieve and further USG goals.

<SUBJECT>R -- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Support
<SOLNBR>H9222-04-R-0036
<RESPDATE>061804
<ARCHDATE>06192004
<CONTACT>David Johnson, Contract Specialist, Phone 813-828-7448, Fax 813-828-7504, Email johnsod@socom.mil
<DESC>QUESTION:  The contractor will be responsible for collection of all USSOCOM open source material.   
 
ANSWER:  No, the contractor will only be required to collect OSINT material  to support report development and assessments where they must use aggregate news sources and not Internet reporting.  Upon tasking, the Contractor will collect open source material that USSOCOM cannot access/obtain/procure, etc.  This mainly entails international collection (An example may be obtaining a copy of a dissertation (Gray literature) written in Arabic and only available in in three national libraries worldwide.  In this case the contractor, upon tasking, would obtain a copy of the document and provide it electronically to USSOCOM NLT 48-hours after tasking.  
QUESTION:  The contractor will be required to perform Rapid Response research on a moments notice; I presume that is the mention of "48 hours notice" mentioned later in the solicitation.  
ANSWER:   Yes.   Upon tasking, the contractor will have 48-hours to provide USSOCOM the OSINT information associated with the requirement.  In some cases, the contractor will be asked to answer the requirement within a smaller window of time.  This is why the contractor MUST have an international overt collection capability.   
Comment  -- If The Contractor Intends To Compete For This Contract By Only Using An Internet Infrastructure, The Majority Of Our Requirements Will Not Be Able To Be Answered. Remember That Osint Research Is Not Totally Geared Against The Internet. The Oseb Only Uses The Internet 30% Of The Time To Accomplish Osint Taskings.  
QUESTION:  The contractor may be required to acquire any combination of Russian Maps. 
ANSWER:  Yes. 
QUESTION:  The contractor must research material in potentially 29 different languages. 
ANSWER:    Yes. This applies to the weekly regional reports, and other special assessment requirements.  The media sources MUST be from indigenous in-country reporting, not BBC ABC, Reuters, AFP, AP, etc.
QUESTION:   The contractor must be prepared to provide Open Source Intelligence Training. ANSWER: Yes.
QUESTION:  The contractor must be prepared to provide advisory services.  ANSWER: Yes. 
QUESTION:  The contractor must provide reports on Foreign SOF capabilities and activity.   ANSWER:Yes.
QUESTION:  The contractor must maintain a TS clearance.   
ANSWER:   Contractor MUST have a minimum TS clearance to conduct exchanges and  coordinate with USSOCOM and the OSEB.
QUESTION: The contractor must submit 4 reports a week, covering Africa, Central  Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and the Pacific Rim; with an additional report each week on Foreign Special Operations activity.
ANSWER: Yes. Each report must contain between 35-45 articles from aggregate sources, not the easy sources (BBC, ABC, Reuters, AFP, AP, etc.) taken from google on the internet.    
QUESTION:   Included in the solicitation is the USSOCOM estimation of 1,508 hours per year for the contractor to commit to this effort. 
ANSWER:   The 1,508 is correct for the base year with a standard work year for the options.     
QUESTION:   It is our intent to provide the best possible service, however; USSOCOM estimated hours total less than 30 hours per week. The quality of your deliverables will be worthless if that is requirement of USSOCOM, we don’t believe the providing contractor will not be able to perform to your satisfaction with this level of effort. 
ANSWER:See statement above.
QUESTION:  We would like to answer your request for services. We are knowledgeable about the requirements of USSOCOM and fully capable to deliver more than what is requested. We understand the requirements of the end user as we were those users until recently. We cannot, however, provide the requested service reasonably with the expectations of 1,508 hours the first year. If you would like to discuss practical solutions, we would like to encourage a conversation.
ANSWER:The OSEB will not compromise a break in the current level of contract support.

<CONTACT>Susan Nsangou, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-435-8867, Fax 301-4023676, Email nsangous@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

The solicitation number for the announcement is NICHD 2004-06 and this announcement is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  This announcement and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-23.
 
This requirement is a total small business set-aside and the associated NAICS code is 541690 and small business size standard is $6.0 million. 

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a requirement for Systematic Literature Summaries, Assessments, Syntheses and Meta-Analyses. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) of 2002 directs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and in consultation with the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and experts in pediatric research, to develop and prioritize a list of drugs for which pediatric clinical studies are needed.  

The BPCA requires the NIH to develop, prioritize and publish in the Federal Register an annual list of approved drugs for which:

1.	There is an approved Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). 
2.	There is a submitted ANDA that could receive FDA approval. 
3.	There is no patent protection or market exclusivity for an existing New Drug Application (NDA.) 
4.	There is referral for inclusion on the list regardless of market protection.

The BPCA legislation states:

CONSIDERATION OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION- In developing and prioritizing the list under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider, for each drug on the list--
(A) 	the availability of information concerning the safe and effective use of the drug in the pediatric population;
(B) 	whether additional information is needed;
(C) 	whether new pediatric studies concerning the drug may produce health benefits in the pediatric population; and
(D) 	whether reformulation of the drug is necessary.

 In addition, the BPCA legislative language identifies the group of drugs eligible for consideration, essentially off-patent medications, for which “additional studies are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the use of the drug in the pediatric population”.  

Annual lists were published in the Federal Register in January 2003 and February 2004, with a mid-cycle list published in August 2003.

The Government has a requirement for the expertise and resources necessary to conduct assessments of the available literature, and systematic reviews of the literature on scientific questions related to implementation of BPCA.  The reviews shall center primarily on prescription medications used by the pediatric populations, but may also include topics related to the conduct of clinical trials in pediatric populations, (e.g., a systematic review of the literature regarding consent processes in pediatric clinical trials.)  

The ontractor shall be required to analyze questions, as specified by the Government, which can be addressed by meta-analysis, and address areas where meta-analysis can be used to inform the labeling process.  This task shall be followed by further meta-analyses conducted to answer specific questions regarding pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), efficacy and safety of prescription drugs in pediatric populations.  

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a searchable database, updated on an annual basis, comprising the literature of case reports, case series, observational studies and clinical trials for off-patent drugs used by the pediatric population. 

BPCA requires NICHD to participate in FDA’s preparation of Written Requests by providing scientific input.  These Written Requests may potentially become future requirements for pediatric clinical studies.  An end result of this process may be to prepare INDs (FDA regulatory documents) leading to drug labeling changes.  

Each of these activities requires literature synthesis, and many shall require meta-analyses.  In infrequent situations, where outside experts state that sufficient data are available to lead directly to comments on labeling changes (without further study), NICHD shall require a complete meta-analysis of efficacy and/or safety data to produce quantitative estimates of efficacy and/or safety.  The Contractor shall maintain a central data base of documents pertaining to the literature, and simultaneously adapt the literature syntheses to the needs at each step of the BPCA process.  This shall require a high level scientific input in design, conduct, and interpretation of each literature search and its products: systematic literature reviews and/or meta-analyses.

There may be instances when systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses are needed to address methodological questions regarding the conduct of pediatric clinical trials, for instance, to summarize approaches to randomization, the consent process, or other questions of study design.

In order to assess the availability of information about individual off-patent drugs, the Government has a requirement for state-of-the art systematic reviews of the literature.  In order to develop and prioritize the annual list, the Government will specify to the Contractor the drugs under consideration. The reviews shall be systematic, follow a validated methodology for search and synthesis, provide documentation, and produce literature syntheses that address the needs for further study.  
From an annual list of approximately 200 off-patent drugs as published in the Federal Register, the Government will identify a group (estimated not-to exceed 35) of drugs requiring initial assessments of the literature. The Government anticipates selecting 12 each year as prioritized for further study.  .  

The Government requires continual expansion and updating of literature reviews throughout the process of developing Written Requests, preparing solicitations, developing clinical trials and submitting data for regulatory labeling.  Smaller groups of drugs will require more extensive literature reviews and meta-analyses, as described below.  

The Contractor shall perform the following services from the annual list: 

1)	Initial assessment of literature - 35 drugs/year. 
The Contractor shall perform a comprehensive assessment of the literature using a standardized search methodology, and documenting the search methodology.  The work shall include all information about the drug in neonates and children under the age of 18.  The assessment of the literature shall include a quantitative enumeration of the total number of references regarding the drug, as well as sub-totals for the following categories:  case-reports and case series, observational studies, and clinical trials.  A separate enumeration will be made by content of the references for the following sub-categories:  PK/PD data, pharmacoepidemiology (patterns of use), efficacy, and safety.  Pharmacoepidemiology shall include:  indications for using the drug in pediatric populations, inpatient and outpatient frequency of use, age, sex and race/ethnicity patterns of use.  The contractor shall develop a summary format to assess the quality and availability of data regarding PK/PD, efficacy and safety for each drug, and to identify research questions requiring further study for scientific of regulatory (labeling) purposes.
2)	Systematic literature review - 24 drugs as specified by the Government. 
The Contractor shall conduct a systematic review of the literature, involving abstraction/extraction of data in the articles identified in item 1, and summarizing findings in tables and text.  These syntheses shall be used to inform detailed discussion of drugs under consideration to be included in the priority list published each January.  The syntheses shall be circulated to expert consultants (Government and non-Government) to assist them in formulating recommendations for prioritization.
3)	Expanded literature review as background for Written Request process - 12 drugs as specified by the Government. 
The Contractor shall expand the systematic reviews prepared under item 2 and provide a literature synthesis to be used as background for NICHD scientists working with FDA to prepare the Written Request for a specified drug.   The emphasis of the literature synthesis shall be to provide information regarding research needs, and information needed in designing a study such as estimates of effect, estimates of adverse events, and measurement of outcomes.
4)	Expanded literature review as background for Project Officer - 12 drugs as specified by the Government
The Contractor shall expand on the systematic reviews prepared under item 3 and prepare a literature synthesis to be used as background for NICHD Project Officers preparing future requirements which may become pediatric clinical studies.
5)	Literature synthesis for regulatory requirements (IND process) - 6 drugs/indication combinations as specified by the Government 
The Contractor  shall expand on the systematic reviews prepared under item 4 to provide a finished document that may be submitted by NICHD to FDA as part of the IND process.
6)	Meta-analyses - 3 drug/indication combinations as specified by the Government 
The Contractor shall conduct meta-analyses of specific questions regarding PK/PD, efficacy and/or safety.  These meta-analyses shall be provided to scientific experts to determine the feasibility and best course of action for initiating a label change based on the published data and the meta-analysis.  The meta-analyses need to be comparable in quality to those published in the best peer reviewed journals. The Government anticipates the publication of the meta-analysis in peer-reviewed journals.
7)	Meta-analysis – 1 methodologic issue in pediatric clinical trials as specified by the Government.
The Contractor shall conduct a meta-analysis of methodologic issues in pediatric clinical trials.
8)	The Contractor shall develop and maintain a searchable data base that accumulates information abstracted/extracted during the period of performance of the contract, 
9)	The Contractor  shall document all methodologies and provide documentation to NICHD in electronic form. 

It is anticipated that this requirement shall be for a base year and up to an additional four one-year option period(s.)  Offerors are instructed to include in their proposal, their prices for the base year and up to an additional four one-year option period(s.) 

The NICHD has an annual requirement for: Initial assessment of literature - 35 drugs/year; Systematic literature review - 24 drugs as specified by the Government; Expanded literature review as background for Written Request process - 12 drugs as specified by the Government; Expanded literature review as background for Project Officer - 12 drugs as specified by the Government; Literature synthesis for regulatory requirements (IND process) - 6 drugs/indication combinations as specified by the Government; and Meta-analysis – 1 methodologic issue in pediatric clinical trials as specified by the Government.
