<DESC>45 Day Announcement - Responses Are Due No Later Than 11/13/03 03CR63-No Solicitation Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies and services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of this synopsis. Salient characteristics: The Department of Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Earth Resources Observation Systems (EROS) Data Center (EDC), has a requirement for specialized services for the maintenance and support of the National Landsat Archive Processing System (NLAPS), which processes Landsat 1-5 and Landsat 7 Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data.  NLAPS also has the capability to process Systeme pour I'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 1-3 panchromatic and multi-spectral data.  This maintenance and support is to cover NLAPS software bug fixes and enhancements.  NLAPS processing of radiometrically, geometrically, precision, and terrain corrected products is performed upon specific user request.  The hardware on which NLAPS executes is supplied by the USGS as Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE).  NLAPS is installed at the EDC in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA.  Software bug fixes and enhancements shall be reported and documented through an electronic problem tracking system.  To provide both continued bug fixes and enhancements to the NLAPS, EDC requires support from the sole developer and maintenance provider of the NLAPS.  Significant portions of the NLAPS software are proprietary, having been competitively procured by the USGS and subject to restricted software rights per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.227-14 Alternate III.  Because of the restricted software clause, competitive firms are not allowed to examine or alter software modules that will be modified to perform radiometric and geometric processing as is required to process Landsat and SPOT data.  Based on the information available at this time and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the specialized services as a sole-source from MacDonald Dettwiler, Richmond, BC, Canada and proposes to negotiate a contract with this firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Vendors who feel that they can furnish the specialized services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and other materials that correspond to the required services stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  No solicitation document exists, therefore, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.   E-mail responses preferred: slintz@usgs.gov See numbered note 22.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of advanced lithography for fabrication of components for advanced military systems.  This includes maskless lithography, non-conventional lithography, and device and tool demonstrations.  Preference will be given to approaches that are offer improved throughput and extendibility to sub-50 nm features.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.  A goal of the program is to develop domestic capabilities of the new technologies.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 03-42 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Awards totaling approximately $15 million over three years are expected to be made during the first half of calendar year 2004.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  The proposed program should consist of an 18-month base, plus an option for the remainder.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site - http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-03-42/ - has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is David O. Patterson, fax:  (703) 469-2066, electronic mail: dpatterson @darpa.mil. 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 03-42, Lithography for Advanced Military Systems, Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on areas of interest, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  An original and six (6) copies of the proposal abstract and two electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) of the abstract [in MS-Word readable (preferred), PDF, HTML, or ASCII format each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip disk, or a CD-ROM] should be submitted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-42, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2.  The proposal abstract (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 03-42) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Wednesday, October 29, 2003.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit an original and six (6) copies of the full proposal and two electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) of the full proposal [in MS-Word readable (preferred), PDF, HTML, or ASCII format, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip disk, or a CD-ROM].  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-42, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 03-42) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, January 9, 2004, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 03-42 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in advanced lithography for 50 nm and below. 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 03-42.  Proposals and proposal abstracts may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, including development of domestic capabilities of the new technologies, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism.  Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.

<DESC>THERE IS NO RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION NEEDED TO SUBMIT SF-254 AND SF-255 DOCUMENTS IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  Services include, but are not limited to the preparation of planning documents of various types normally used by the U.S. Navy, and technical services related to documents and software as may be requested by the Department of the Navy, PACNAVFACENGCOM.  The primary tasks anticipated for the Architect-Engineer (A-E), are the originating and the updating of planning studies and documents.  Additionally, the A-E may be assigned ancillary work to edit and rework incomplete or preliminary planning documents towards final completed products based on technical knowledge and skills gained by professional training and experience in the planning and maintenance of military and Government facilities and installations.  Planning documents, as referred to herein, include but are not limited to any document relating to Master Plans, Capital Improvement Plans, Regional Shore Infrastructure Planning (RSIP) Overview and Functional Studies, Special Planning Studies, Air Installations Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ) Studies, Land Use Studies, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Studies, Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection Studies, Military Training Studies, Space Studies (e.g., Administrative), Military Construction and Special Projects write-ups (normally on Department of Defense Standard Form 1391) with supporting documents (e.g., Cost Estimate, Site Plans, NEPA documentation, etc.), Engineering Evaluations (EEs), Facilities Requirements Plans (FRP), Basic Facility Requirement (BFR) justifications, Economic Analyses (EA), System Safety documents, Site Approval requests, Environmental Studies, Civil Engineering Support Plan, Land Inventory Analyses, studies, visual presentations, graphics, and/or any component or portion (not necessarily the entirety) of such documents.  The work will also include the production of planning documents and studies over the Navy's intranet, including the programming of associated software necessary to or incidental thereto.  Field verification survey work may also be an ancillary part of the planning process.  Any preparatory work, visual presentation, briefing, study, or report, which may be required prior to the initiation of any planning document listed, is also included under this scope.  Planning projects may include those for other U.S. Military Commands and Agencies (e.g., U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard, and other agencies) in the Pacific and Indian Ocean area, in addition to those of the U.S. Navy.  The A-E shall provide all professional services required for the completion of planning documents, including researching data, conducting site surveys, preparing, reviewing, and editing technical text and graphics to ensure completeness and correctness of documents.  When such services are required of the A-E for projects not wholly assigned to the A-E alone, the A-E must exercise professional judgment to verify the correctness and validity of the information, and the results and conclusions of the material the A-E is called upon to finalize.  The A-E must analyze, coordinate, correlate, synthesize, correct, supplement, and finalize the work assigned.  As an example of such an assignment, if the A-E is called upon to finalize the draft of a document or a particular graphic submitted by PACNAVFACENGCOM, the A-E shall rework such document or graphic until, in the A-E's judgment, the finished product is correct, complete, and reflective of the A-E's professional judgment and standards.  The A-E shall provide electronic deliverables for the publication of planning documents and the integration of source data used or generated during the planning process into the Regional Shore Infrastructure Plan (RSIP-Link) information system.  The primary purpose of the RSIP-Link System is to disseminate Regional Overview Plans, Functional Plans, and Other Studies/Documents to customer Activities via the Internet and to provide access to geospatial data through GIS interface.  All geospatial data shall conform to the RSIP-Link GIS Mapping Standards.  The Government utilizes the following software suite, which conforms to the approved Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) software suite:  Windows 2000 Workstation, Microsoft Office 2000 Professional Suite:  Word 2000, Powerpoint 2000, Excel 2000, Access 2000, Outlook 2000, Internet Explorer 5.5, Netscape Navigator 4.78, Adobe Acrobat 4.05C.  The Government utilizes AutoDesk’s AutoCAD 2002 as its CAD software.  In preparation of manuscripts, word processing files, desktop publishing documents, graphics and spreadsheets, the A-E shall ensure compatibility with the approved NMCI software suite.  Additional multi-media electronic software applications required, but not limited to, are: RSIP-Link, Dbase (dbf), Oracle 8.i, Auto Desk’s AutoCAD 2002 (DWG) or higher, Microstation 5.0, Visual Basic, Visual FoxPro, ArcView 3.2x or higher (SHP, SHX, SHB, DBF), ArcInfo Coverage Format, ArcSDE Format or as an ArcGIS geodatabase, and HTML screens.  The A-E shall also be responsible for training Government representatives on operation of the planning software and maintenance of data files.  The selected A-E may be required to participate in a pre-fee meeting within ten days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days from the meeting.  The contract will be an Indefinite Quantity type where the work will be required on an "as-needed" basis during the life of the contract providing the Government and contractor agree on the amount.  Each project will be a firm fixed-price task order.  The Government will determine the task order amount by using the rates negotiated for the basic contract and negotiate the effort required to perform the particular project.  The contract base period shall not exceed twelve months or $1,250,000 total fee, whichever comes first.  The Government guarantees a minimum amount of $25,000 for the contract.  Should an impasse on the price occur over the initial or subsequent projects, the Government will apply the dollar value of the Government estimate for that project or projects toward the minimum guarantee.  The Government reserves the option to extend the contract for an additional three option years, each with an maximum fee of $1,250,000 per year, for a total contract performance period of four years.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: US Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attn: Strategic Business Plan for Ariana Airlines - Afghanistan  :  The Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism (MOCAT) invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to develop a Strategic Business Plan for Ariana, the national airline of Afghanistan.

The aviation sector in Afghanistan has been devastated by two decades of war.  The large size, poor condition of the internal road system, isolation from the rest of the world, and fractious political situation make the revitalization of this sector essential for both political stability and economic growth.    

Ariana was founded in 1957 and soon formed a joint venture with Pan American Airlines.  At the same time the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was deeply involved in the establishment of the country’s airports and overall aviation infrastructure. This history, which included training of technical personnel, pilots and management, is a source of considerable loyalty to the U.S. among Ariana and MOCAT management.  

The years of conflict, combined with the imposition of Soviet style bureaucratic management, has dealt the aviation industry a severe blow.  Starting in December of 2001 with the formation of a new national authority, Afghanistan has begun to resurrect its civil aviation sector with help from several external actors - i.e., the coalition forces, International Civil Aviation Organization, and the International Air Transport Association.  While a limited capability has been restored, the rebuilding effort is still at a preliminary stage due, inter alia, to severe resource limitations and a starting point that has been described as "below zero".  

Ariana is currently a department of MOCAT. The physical assets of the airline have largely been destroyed.  Ariana is in need of serious restructuring if it is to survive.  However, Ariana’s management team lacks the skills necessary to develop a strategic business plan for airline.  This TA seeks to address this need.

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this technical assistance will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $333,034 grant to the MOCAT from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism of Afghanistan c/o USTDA by 4:00 P.M. October 27, 2003, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  MOCAT reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  MOCAT also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  MOCAT is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for DARPA’s Information Processing Technology Office to perform research, development, modeling, design, and testing to support the Self-Regenerative Systems (SRS) program.  Network-centric warfare demands robust systems that can respond automatically and dynamically to both accidental and deliberate faults.  Adaptation of fault-tolerant computing techniques has made computing and information systems intrusion-tolerant and much more survivable during cyber attacks, but even with these advancements, a system will inevitably exhaust all resources in the face of a sustained attack by a determined cyber adversary.  Computing systems and information systems also have a tendency to become more fragile and susceptible to accidental faults and errors over time if manually applied maintenance or refresh routines are not administered regularly.  The Self-Regenerative Systems (SRS) program seeks to address these deficiencies by creating a new generation of security and survivability technologies.  These “fourth-generation” technologies will bring attributes of human cognition to bear on the problem of reconstituting systems that suffer the accumulated effects of imperfect software, human error, and accidental hardware faults, or the effects of a successful cyber attack.  The overarching goals of the SRS program are to implement systems that always provide critical functionality and show a positive trend in reliability, actually exceeding initial operating capability and approaching a theoretical optimal performance level over long time intervals.  Desired capabilities include self-optimization, self-diagnosis, and self-healing; it will be important for systems to support self-awareness and reflection in order to achieve these capabilities.

The approach of this program to constructing self-regenerative systems that meet the above needs is to create fourth generation survivability and security mechanisms to complement received first-generation security mechanisms (trusted computing bases, encryption, authentication and access control), second-generation security mechanisms (boundary controllers, intrusion detection systems, public key infrastructure, biometrics) and third-generation security and survivability mechanisms (real-time execution monitors, error detection and damage prevention, error compensation and repair).  Among other things, new fourth generation technologies will draw on biological metaphors such as natural diversity and immune systems to achieve robustness and adaptability, the structure of organisms and ecosystems to achieve scalability, and human cognitive attributes (reasoning, learning and introspection) to achieve the capacity to predict, diagnose, heal and improve the ability to provide service.

The vulnerabilities of computing and information systems addressed by this program include mobile/malicious code, denial-of-service attacks, and misuse and malicious insider threats, as well as accidental faults introduced by human error and the problems associated with software aging. The program will build on the advances made in earlier programs addressing the DoD’s operational needs for information systems, such as the ability to operate through attacks, maintenance of critical functionality, graceful degradation of non-critical functions in the face of intrusions and attacks when full functionality cannot be maintained, and the ability to dynamically trade off security, performance and functionality as a function of threat. 

Fault-tolerant systems deal with accidental faults and errors while intrusion-tolerant systems cope with malicious, intentional faults caused by an intelligent adversary.  Combining fault- and intrusion-tolerance technologies produces very robust and survivable systems, but these techniques depend upon resources that may eventually be depleted beyond the point required to maintain critical system functionality.  The fourth generation technologies we seek will reconstitute and reconfigure these resources in such a manner that the systems are better protected in the process, reliability is continually improved as vulnerabilities and software bugs are discovered and fixed autonomously, and the ability to provide critical services is never lost.
 
Assessment and validation of self-regenerative approaches will be carried out to determine their efficacy.  The challenge here is that security and survivability requirements have heretofore defied quantification and analytical approaches.  Progress made in creating a practical framework for validating intrusion-tolerance techniques will be built upon and extended to validate SRS technologies.

The first phase of this effort is planned to be 18 months long.  This is a solicitation for Phase I only.  If results are promising, a Phase II follow-on program is a possibility.

Phase I program goals are to create the core technologies needed to design and develop systems that provide 100% critical functionality at all times in spite of attacks; for a system to learn its own vulnerabilities over time, to ameliorate those vulnerabilities, to regenerate service after attack, and ultimately, to improve its survivability over time.
The ultimate goal at the end of a Phase II program would be to achieve sufficient system robustness and regenerative capacity to provide 100 per cent availability of critical functionality and system integrity in the face of sustained malicious attacks and accidental faults.


There will be four major research thrusts in the Phase I technology development of the program.  These areas, along with their success criteria, are as follows:

Biologically-inspired diversity.  This research thrust area will create a genetically diverse computing fabric in which diversity limits the impact of any given vulnerability.  Coarse-grained diversity (e.g., using several different operating systems or server software packages in an architecture) has been used to achieve intrusion tolerance, but that approach was limited by the relatively small number of manually-created interchangeable operating systems, server packages, and similar software components.  The technical approach of the SRS program is to achieve fine-grained diversity at the module level to remove common vulnerabilities and to automatically generate numerous diverse software versions.  The success criterion for this thrust is the automatic production of 100 functionally-equivalent versions of a software component with no more than 33 having the same deficiency.

Cognitive immunity and self-healing.  This research thrust area will show automated cyber immune response and system regeneration.  The technical approach will include biologically-inspired response strategies, machine learning, and cognitively-inspired proactive automatic contingency planning.  The success criterion for this thrust is the accurate diagnosis of at least 10% of the root causes of system problems and automatic effective corrective action for at least half of those diagnoses.

Granular, scalable redundancy.  This research thrust area will increase the practicality of redundancy techniques by dramatically reducing the time required to achieve consistency among replicas after an update.  This thrust area will attack the consistency problem in two distinct sub-areas—a centralized server setting, and a distributed publish/subscribe setting.  Performers who propose to the scalable redundancy thrust area may address either or both sub-areas.  Success criteria here include the following:  in the centralized server setting, attain a three-fold reduction in latency for achieving consistency of replicated data while tolerating up to five Byzantine failures; in the distributed publish/subscribe setting, attain a fifteen-fold reduction in latency for achieving consistent values of data shared among one hundred to ten thousand participants while using robust epidemic algorithms, where all participants can send and receive events.

Reasoning about the insider threat to preempt insider attacks and detect system overrun.  The technical approach will include inferring user goals, enabling anomaly detection, and combining and correlating information from system layers, direct user challenges, etc.  The success criterion for this thrust is the thwarting or delaying of at least 10% of insider attacks.

These research areas will explore techniques that span the spectrum from autonomic/reflexive response through and including introspection and learning. Proposals should address only one research thrust area.  A proposer may submit multiple proposals.  The success criteria for the four thrust areas constitute the program’s gating evaluation criteria for the possibility of a Phase II follow-on program.  They are minimum requirements to gain confidence that self-regenerative systems are feasible.  A Phase II program would seek much higher levels of performance.  Phase I offerors are strongly encouraged to aim for performance that exceeds these criteria where possible.

It is envisioned that a Phase II program would integrate the more promising techniques into an exemplar system prototype to demonstrate the advantages of implementing these technologies in high value critical applications.  The system demonstrated would exhibit the fourth generation capabilities of self-optimization, self-awareness, self-diagnosis, self-healing and reflection..  

Offerors must state in their proposals a plan for providing deliverables for installation, training, manuals, etc. required for evaluation by the testing facility, as well as travel costs. Offerors should support the technical feasibility of their concept or idea and discuss the future development of their ideas, validation and transition. 

TEST AND EVALUATION.  Performers will test and evaluate their technologies using their own facilities and report results at PI meetings.  In addition, performers will provide software distributions and will document all test and evaluation choices and procedures (hardware, software environment, scenario, etc.) with enough clarity for a third party to repeat the evaluations.  Regarding test and evaluation, an Independent Evaluation Team (IET) will collaborate with performers to foster out-of-the-box thinking and sharing of results among performers and the larger research community.  Because progress in the scalable, granular redundancy research thrust area is relative to a baseline that is very sensitive to the testing environment, performers in that area will construct a testbed environment, establish a test procedure, test the best available techniques to determine baseline performance in that testbed, and report their baseline results at the first PI meeting.  Testing and evaluation for granular, scalable redundancy techniques developed in Phase I will be conducted on an identical testbed.

PROGRAM SCOPE.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art. Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered. However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in minor evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on special-purpose systems or narrow applications. 

This solicitation is for Phase I only.  A separate full and open solicitation is possible at a later date for a Phase II program.   Offerors should not propose a base effort exceeding 18 months.  Any such proposal doing so may be disregarded.  Options for up to an additional twelve months over the base period will be acceptable.  Any offeror may submit a proposal in accordance with the requirements and procedures identified in this BAA. These requirements and procedures include the form and format for proposals.  Phase I is planned to be unclassified, but Phase II is likely to be a classified program.  Offerors who desire to be able to participate in a possible Phase II program are encouraged to be willing and able to obtain appropriate security clearances.

GENERAL INFORMATION

This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) requires completion of a BAA Cover Sheet for each Proposal prior to submission.  This cover sheet can be accessed at the following URL:
http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=03-44

After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to every copy.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of the Proposal.  If a proposer intends on submitting more than one Proposal, a unique UserId and password must be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.

Security classification guidance on a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award.  If you choose to submit a classified proposal you must first receive the permission of the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA.  


NEW REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES:  The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/IPTO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be submitted electronically via the DARPA/IPTO Technical-Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government-furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  

PROPOSAL FORMAT

Proposers must submit an original and 3 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk, 100 MB Iomega Zip disk or cd).  Mac-formatted disks will not be accepted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-44, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy number of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 4:00 PM (ET) Wednesday, November 26, 2003, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 03-44, SRS will remain open until 12:00 NOON (ET) September 24, 2004. Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through September 24, 2004. While the proposals submitted after the Wednesday, November 26, 2003, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  DARPA will acknowledge receipt of submissions and assign control numbers that should be used in all further correspondence regarding proposals.

Proposers must obtain the BAA 03-44 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and proposal formats.  This pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/solicitations.htm.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 03-44 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. 

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal, using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance:

(1)	Overall Scientific and Technical Merit: The overall scientific and technical merit must be clearly identifiable and compelling. The technical concept should be clearly defined, developed and defensibly innovative. Emphasis should be placed on the technical excellence of the development and experimentation approach.

(2)	Innovative Technical Solution to the Problem:  Proposed efforts should apply new or existing technology in an innovative way such as is advantageous to the objectives.  The plan on how the offeror intends to get developed technology artifacts and information to the user community should be considered.  The offeror shall specify quantitative experimental methods and metrics by which the proposed technical effort’s progress shall be measured.

(3) Potential Contribution and Relevance to DARPA/IPTO Mission:  The offeror must clearly address how the proposed effort will meet the goals of the undertaking and how the proposed effort contributes to significant advances to the DARPA/IPTO mission.  

(4)	Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience:  The qualifications, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principals and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations must be clearly shown.

(5)	Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition:  The offeror should provide a clear explanation of how the technologies to be developed will be transitioned to capabilities for military forces.  Technology transition should be a major consideration in the design of experiments, particularly considering the potential for involving potential transition organizations in the experimentation process.

(6)	Cost Realism:  The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be clearly shown as well as the substantiation of the costs for the technical complexity described.    Evaluation will consider the value to Government of the research and the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed.  Cost is considered a substantial evaluation criterion but secondary to technical excellence.

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, must be received at one of the administrative addresses below by 12:00 NOON (ET) September 10, 2004; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for some of the correspondence regarding BAA 03-44.  Proposals MUST NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  All proposals, administrative correspondence, and questions submitted in response to this solicitation must be in the English language.  Submissions received in other than English shall be rejected.

Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by a support contractor.  This support contractor is prohibited from competition in DARPA technical research and is bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only.”   While non-government personnel may review proposals, contractors will not be used to conduct evaluations or analyses of any aspect of a proposal submitted under this BAA, unless one of the three conditions identified in FAR 37.203(d) applies.

This research would capture the cost differences between small and large firms.  Potential sources of data for analysis include trade association data, information from the Current Population Survey, and other sources.  However, the limitations of available data may force researchers into investigating the possibility of generating data from the Internal Revenue Service, Statistics of Income.

This study is needed because a main source for employee benefits statistics comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and BLS has information only by size of establishment, not firm, making the information unusable for firm-size studies.  Of particular interest are very small employers.  Fax or Email proposals will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>R -- STUDY DISTRIBUTION OF THE COST OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-03-Q-0012
<RESPDATE>062703
<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>Background:  The costs of Federal regulations have been documented in two previous Office of Advocacy studies, Hopkins (1995), and Crain and Hopkins (2001).  Building on the knowledge base developed by the 1995 study, the 2001 research took a broader approach and further documented that small businesses do bear a disproportionate share of the burden imposed by Federal regulations.  The latter of these studies, for instance, found that the cost per employee for compliance with all regulations was $6,975 for firms with 20 or fewer employees but $4,463 for large firms with more than 500 employees.  In addition, small businesses spent twice as much complying with tax regulations as large businesses.  These two studies can both be found at http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/#regulation.

The Office of Advocacy would like to update this existing research.  Possible research avenues should follow, enhance, and expand the existing research in order to allow us to compare the results with the previous work.

<SUBJECT>R -- STUDY COSTS OF DEVELOPING A FOREIGN MARKET FOR A SMALL BUSINESS
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-03-Q-0013
<RESPDATE>062703
<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>Small business policy makers are continually proposing programs to assist small firms to export to foreign markets, citing the statistics showing few small firms selling to world market.  The success of export promotion programs have always been evaluated in the context of “so few small firms” exporting despite the great efforts of promotion.

Most small firms do not export because the costs of developing export markets far exceed the additional profits derived from export promotion. The cost of developing foreign markets has always been much higher, in terms of monetary costs, as it takes patience to turn a profit and to maintain these markets. This is further hampered by the higher costs of selling to foreign customers—higher costs of contract dispute litigation, currency value fluctuations, as well payment settlements, etc.  A better understanding of these costs of exporting would certainly assist policy making in developing programs to assist small firms in entering or not entering foreign markets.

The researcher will investigate the costs involved for small firms to expand into foreign markets.  For instance, there are costs involved in learning about the new market(s) for a firm’s products including knowing more about the foreign customers, the competition, and the costs of developing sales leads and negotiating sales.  In addition, the cost involved in fulfilling the sales contracts as well all other direct and indirect costs.  A careful review of literature is mandatory.  Market and non-market factors contributing to the high costs of exporting by small firms should be identified and the potential for reducing these costs investigated.

<SUBJECT>R -- STUDY STATE PROCUREMENT AND SMALL BUSINESS
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-03-Q-0014
<RESPDATE>062703
<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>The Office of Advocacy has not explored the effect of small business procurement at the state and local level since a report in 1991.  That report (see Research Summary #108) stated that small firms accounted for 80 percent of the total state and local contracts with the private sector, and that most of these contracts were with companies within their jurisdiction.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) has proposed a rule that would implement section 211 of the E-Government Act of 2002.  Section 211 would open up the Federal Supply Schedule to the state, local, regional or tribal governments (including local educational agencies or institutions of higher education).  This new rule is limited in scope to Federal supply classification code group 70, which includes: “automated data processing equipment (including firmware), software, supplies, support equipment, and services.”  The primary motivation for this rule, according to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, is to “make ‘government’ (considering all levels) more efficient by reducing duplication of effort and utilizing volume purchasing techniques for the acquisition of IT products and services.”  Approximately 68 percent of GSA schedule 70 contractors are small businesses.  However, the top twenty schedule 70 vendors – all large businesses – reported $5.3 billion in schedule business in 2002; the three largest schedule 70 firms are: Dell Computer ($1.3 billion in schedule 70 sales), IBM Corporation ($505 million), and Northrup Grumman Information Technology ($406 million).   

The General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a study on expanding the GSA schedules similar to this proposed rule in 1996.  It found an overwhelming number of state and local procurement managers would use the GSA schedules if it were available to them; however, existing state and local laws might preclude them from doing so (including competitive bidding restrictions, rules limiting purchases to in-state firms, and/or preferences for special groups).  Many of the current state and local contractors in this study, especially those that were small businesses, worried that opening up the competition for contracts to include GSA vendors would have a negative effect on their business.   This report, though, was less clear on the overall implications for small firms.

Questions that should be addressed in any research proposal should include, but are not limited to: What is the impact of this rule change on small business?  Does it expand opportunities for small businesses, or would it be a net loss for them (especially those accustomed to receiving state and local contracts)?  Would state and local small businesses need to add themselves to the GSA schedules to remain competitive, and is GSA capable of handling the influx of new schedule filers if that is the case?  Moreover, while this particular rule limits its scope to information technology products and services, what are the implications if it is expanded to include more schedules?  

Previous studies have utilized case analysis; however, this research is not limited to that methodology.  State procurement managers, associations, or public records might provide ample data.  It might be advisable to limit the scope to specific states or localities (rather than exploring all fifty state and numerous regional and local governments).

<SUBJECT>R -- STUDY FIRM SIZE DYNAMICS OF INDUSTRIES
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-03-Q-0015
<RESPDATE>062703
<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>Industries tend to have life cycles which are often based on technology.  This research would compare new, growing, and declining industries from the perspective of business turnover and competition with special attention to technology and price shocks as they relate to small business.  The researchers would most likely need to determine industry ages (or stages), technology levels by industry (possible using changing shares of skilled workers) and product price changes by industry.  A potential model would be to determine the factors that affect the industry firm turnover rate, in addition to other potential models.  

Industry firm size data is available from the U.S. Census Bureau that could assist with this research (www.sba.gov/advo/stats/data.html, www.census.gov/csd/susb/susb.htm).  The dynamic Census data is a potential data source as it contains information on establishment births and closures by firm size in addition to establishment growth and decline information for continuing establishments from 1989 to present with about a two year lag.  Another possibility would be using information from Dun & Bradstreet that tracks firms through time.  Proposals using the U.S. Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns would most likely not be able to complete this research as it is not a longitudinal database and does not have firm size information.  Regardless of the data used, proposals need to present a convincing case for the ability to secure access to data that will complete the project within 12 months.  NOTE  The Solicitation document will posted 5/28/03 on FEDBIZOPS.  No other documents will be issued.  Provide four (4) copies of your price and technical data.

<SUBJECT>R -- RESEARCH ON THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING TO SMALL FIRMS USING THE SURVEYS OF SMALL BUSINESS FINANCES
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-03-Q-0016
<RESPDATE>062703
<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>The Federal Reserve Board has conducted three major surveys on small business finances, the most recent survey being the SSBF-1998 for financing information in 1998.  (See www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/surveys/.)  The survey contained a wealth of  information on small business finance related issues—the uses of various types of financing from such suppliers as banks, finance companies, leasing companies, friends and family, and owners, as well as a firm’s experience in obtaining the most recent loan.  The Office of Advocacy is interested in research topics on small business financing utilizing this database. 

The researchers will develop topics on small business finances using the survey(s) to investigate the availability of financing to special sub-groups of small firms—namely, small minority and/or small women-owned firms. The research should attempt to answer the question regarding the efficient operation of the market(s) such as-- “whether there existed a financing gap in the credit market(s) for a sub-group of firms in market environment where a multitude of alternative financing sources are available.”

DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide an update to the DHS SPIRIT Project.  1) The issuance of the RFP is delayed.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be released in October 2003.  2) Delay is due to the temporary closing of USCG Headquarters for over a week as a result of damage sustained from Hurricane Isabel.  This affected end of Fiscal Year activities and caused our contracting resources to be diverted to assist others.  In addition, we are working with the SBA to resolve issues identified by the SBA regarding the 8(a) approach planned for SPIRIT.  These issues must be addressed and approved prior to release of the RFP.  NOTE:  Due to overwhelming interest in this requirement, no phone inquiries, e-mails or requests to meet “one-on-one” will be answered.  All further DHS SPIRIT project information, including the RFP will be posted on this site as it becomes available.  Thank you for your patience!

1. Overview: AF 36-2226, Combat Arms Program, chapter 2, allows weapons simulators to be used to qualify personnel with weapons. Weapons simulators are needed at all Air Combat Command (ACC) bases to provide continuing weapons qualification training when small arms ranges are closed for repair, ammunition is unavailable, or for northern tier bases when weather prohibits their use. During FY03 and FY04, 14 bases within ACC will be closing their ranges for major renovations. These renovations will last from weeks to months, according to the level of work being performed. Considering ACC Combat Arms sections annually provide weapons qualification training to over 75K people, the loss of even a few days of training time can directly effect ours Wing’s arming ability. Weapons simulators can also be used to provide unique training opportunities for specific missions. Units can use the systems to conduct judgmental training by the use of shoot-don't shoot scenarios or, by the use of authoring stations, they can create localized training scenarios to provide realistic training. AFI 36-2226 mandates simulator weapons must perform in all respects like actual weapons. To meet the need of the command and AFI 36-2226 requirements, the following requirements were developed: 

2. Weapons requirements to be included in the price of the system: 2.1. System must have 10 M16A2 rifles, 10 M9 pistols, and 10 M4 carbines with flat top universal rails.  2.2. Weapons must be capable of using owner installed optics, laser and inferred pointers as they were designed without interfering with system operations or affecting warranties. 2.3. Weapons and systems used to control weapons, must use accurate and validated ballistics for each type of weapon. Ballistic data must have been previously validated by another federal agency.  The integration of another companies validated ballistic data into the training system will satisfy the Air Force’s validation requirement’s under this section. VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:  There must be a high degree of variation in ballistic effects for different types/sizes of ammunition.  While some ammunition may have a relatively flat trajectory over typical shooting distances, others may have a pronounced arc, forcing the shooter to learn to compensate.  The most obvious example of this is the fact that a pistol does not shoot like a rifle.   A more subtle example involves the way some ammunition drifts during its flyout.  This drift causes the projectile to move left or right based on the direction of its spin.  When firing a weapon such as the 40mm MK19, this drift must be modeled, if the shooter is to be expected to ever fire the real weapon accurately.  In addition a high-fidelity simulator must teach the shooter to compensate for the effects of wind.  This windage effect is not only a matter of wind speed and direction, but also of firing distance.  In order to correctly calculate this effect, ballistics must be factored in.  Another function of ballistics is to terminate the flight of the projectile at the proper distance.  In the absence of correct ballistics, the projectile will fly to the incorrect distance or virtually forever.  Each of these computations allows for the proper adjustment to the flight path of that round, given the amount of time, distance, and wind that has elapsed since the round left the weapon.  The system uses that information, along with a highly precise laser detection system to provide characteristics matching that of real ammunition in real weapons.   Additionally, basic trajectory data is provided at one meter intervals in ballistic tables from launch to the terminal range of a given projectile’s trajectory.  Unit effects data is provided at range increments appropriate to the weapon involved.  The unit effects to a constant height are used for constant height and to a constant range.  Unit effects to a constant height are used for horizontal targets; unit effects to a constant range are used for vertical targets.  Ballistic data used in the calculations include:  ballistic air density, ballistic air temperature, ballistic range wind, ballistic vertical wind, ballistic cross wind, altitude of the meteorological datum plane, grid declination, non-standard meteorological data, thrust factors, base burn time, weight of projectile, twist of rifling, diameter of projectile, center of gravity of projectile, and axial moment of inerta.  All data is integrated into the ballistic equations per weapon type and projectile type for calculations.  Small arms training systems must use this data on a per weapon type projectile type to accurately calculate the terminal point of the projectile on all targets based on the vertical and horizontal range. SMALL ARMS TRAJECTORIES AND VALIDATION:  Data calculated are basic trajectories at one-meter range increments to the given weapon’s maximum range, plus unit effects data.  The weapons covered are the M16A2, M249, M9, M203, MK19, and M1200.  During validation the following data is measured by placing a simulated target at one meter and then moving it to the maximum range at one-meter increments and   taking measurements of the simulated strike of the projectile at each increment.  Once this is done a comparison of the same data that is in government or commercially available ballistic data is conducted to ensure that they match within an acceptable range.  In the case of one of the systems the mean is + or - .0001.  2.4. Weapons must operate and function the same as actual service weapons. System operator must have the ability, at any time during scenarios, to inject real time malfunctions/stoppages. 2.5. Air supplied to the weapons must be supplied by a light weight, easily portable, low noise, air compressor that can be locally repaired or replaced with an off-the-shelf model, if needed. 2.6. When a weapon becomes unserviceable, to minimize training interruption the immediate availability of replacement weapons (within 24 hours) from the vendor is mandatory. 2.7. At a minimum, all weapons must have a one-year warranty on parts, labor, shipping and handling. 2.8. All weapons must have a minimum life expectancy of 225,000 rounds. 2.9. At a minimum, weapons and supporting systems must maintain a minimum in-commission rate of 85%. 

3. Simulator requirements to be included in the price of the system: 3.1. Software and licenses must be assigned per system, not location or individual. Each system will be equipped with original copies of all programs used in the system in the event a system must be reloaded. 3.2. The system must be a complete turnkey operation to include all power cords, cables, and other items to make the system operational. 3.3. System must be able to operate on European or US electrical standards without the use of additional external transformers. 3.4. System must come equipped with a 19-inch color CRT monitor or a 17-inch color flat panel monitor. 3.5. Each system must have a built in capability to edit any and all scenarios or courses of fire (COF) used on the system. Capability must allow for on-site, immediate customization and editing of scenarios/COF, ability to create infinite quantities of customized scenarios/COF, and the ability to create and edit localized specific scenarios/COF. If special cameras, camcorders, accessory kits, or equipment is needed they will be provided by the vendor as part of the system. 3.6. Computer used to operate the system must use high-speed processor and appropriate levels of memory to ensure no slipping, skipping, or pauses during scenarios/COF. 3.7. A high fidelity sound system must provide realistic sound and be fully controllable by the system operator at all times. 3.8. System must have global logistic and maintenance support capabilities in the event systems are deployed and require support. 3.9. System must have preloaded and ready-to-use AF-validated rifle Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC) of fire, the Tactical Rifle Qualification Course (TRQC) of fire, and pistol AFQC. Courses of fire will be validated by ACC prior acceptance of systems. 3.10. System must allow for different weapons to be fired simultaneously off the same system during marksmanship, collective, or judgmental training sessions. System must also be capable of allowing single weapons to be fired without affecting the course of fire or scenario of other students. This is needed when a single shooter must re-fire a phase or order of fire. 3.11. The system must have a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week help desk available for owners to access. Help desk must be staffed with knowledgeable personnel who can walk the owner through troubleshooting steps. 3.12. System must provide slow motion and real-time playback of scenarios and the shooters reactions, to include weapons tracking (both pre- and post-fire), weapon pitch, weapons cant, and scoring of hits. 3.13. Images must be projected by using a high fidelity projector. 3.14. Systems must be capable of providing individual and group data collection and storage. Data must be able to be printed out via high-speed color printer. 3.15. All scenarios must be contained within the system in a Windows-based format. Scenarios and COF may be loaded into the system, but run from tapes or disks. 3.16. System must come with a one-year, on-site warrantee support covering all parts, labor, shipping and handling.  3.17. Vendor must provide, at a minimum, annual program updates and maintenance to program files. 3.18. System must be capable of future expansion by adding on additional weapons, scenarios/COFs, additional hardware or software with no risk to owning units of compatibility issues between old and new items. 3.19. System operator must have the ability to view and provide physical feedback to students from the aggressors' prospective. This must be in the form of reusable, non-marking projectiles that will inflict limited pain to students, but will not have enough force to break the skin. Must be equipped with a minimum of 100 projectiles between 40 and 70 caliber and be delivered by an air driven or electronic cannon. System operator must have the option of selecting single- or multiple-round firing capabilities. Camera associated with the shoot back capability must be in color and should be viewed on the same operator display being used to monitor the scenario/COF being run. 3.20. System must be fully equipped to create and author localized judgmental and collective training scenarios. Localized scenarios must be capable of providing slow motion and real-time feedback and hit scoring. 

4. Training requirements to be included in the price of the system: 4.1. Each owning unit must be provided a minimum of a 1-day, on-site system operator course. This course must educate operators on all aspects of the system. At a minimum they must be educated on set up, installation, operation, troubleshooting, and packing the weapons and the system for shipment. 4.2. Vendor will provide a train-the-trainer course at an ACC base of our choosing to 5 people on how to create and develop localized judgmental and collective scenarios. The complete ship to address, point of contact, and telephone number will be in the award document. The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipments in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery points specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute is seeking to establish a Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program to assist the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, NCI in fulfilling its mission to identify more effective treatments for children with cancer.  The Contractor shall be responsible for the following tasks:

A.	TASK AREA 1 - IN VIVO TESTING

In vivo testing panel:  The Offeror shall establish and maintain a panel of pre-clinical models for 6 to 8 childhood cancers, with each cancer type represented by 6-10 different xenograft lines deemed suitable for in vivo drug testing (henceforth termed the pediatric pre-clinical panel).

Stage 1 testing: The Offeror shall conduct experiments to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ten to fifteen agents (or combinations of agents) annually in the first stage of testing.  Stage 1 testing of an agent shall involve evaluating the test agent's activity at its MTD against the entire pediatric pre-clinical panel.

Stage 2 testing:  For agents for which anti-tumor activity is observed in Stage 1 testing, Stage 2 testing shall include a further evaluation of the anti-tumor activity of the agent against the selected tumor types for which activity was observed in Stage 1.  The testing to be performed in Stage 2 will vary depending upon the agent and the responsive tumor types, but may include developing a full dose response curve for the agent against the tumor types for which activity was identified in Stage 1 testing; studying the pharmacokinetics of the agent to correlate anti-tumor activity with the agent's blood levels; studying the agent in orthotopic mouse models and in models of metastatic disease; and studying the agent in relevant genetically engineered mouse models.

The Statement of Work for the requirement is as follows: Contractor Requirements: The contractor will sequence100 mouse genes in probands derived from 27 well phenotyped mouse lines that display cardiac developmental defects associated with homozygous mutations induced by ENU mutagenesis.  The DNA sequencing will be carried out using standard Sanger dideoxysequencing method after the genomic DNA has been PCR amplified using appropriate oligonucleotide primers for each of the target genes.  Government Responsibilities: The Laboratory of Developmental Biology of the NHLBI at the Nationals institutes of Health will provide genomic DNA from 27 well-phenotyped mouse lines exhibiting CHD for DNA sequencing analysis.  The DNA samples will be prepared in a manner suitable for PCR amplification.  Reporting Requirements and Deliverables: This effort will take approximately forty five (45) days after sequencing commences.  An initial period of approximately one (1) month will be required for ordering and testing sequencing primers.  After all sequence variations are indentified, we anticipate 2-3 months for data analysis, confirmation and evaluation of mutations in affected relatives.  The sequence data and sequence trace files, as well as the oligonucleotide primer sequences used for PCR amplification, shall be provided to the Laboratory of Developmental Biology of the NHLBI.  Inspection and Aceeptance Requirements: The contractor shall provide midpoint updates on the status of sequencing and shall provide complete sequence data and trace files at the end of the project.  This requirement is under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number 541380 and the Small Business Size Standard is $6.0 Million.

<DESC>The purpose of amendment 0003 is to respond to vendor questions received to date.  QUESTION #26:  Clarify Question 21, will the gov't provide the Network Terminal connector, NT1's? You say to delete them.  This is typically supplied by the AV contractor along with the other Polycom items, in all my dealings with DLA & DTRA over the past 7 years, I have always provided this NT1's, the agency only supplies the actual ISDN lines which connect to the NT1's.  ANSWER:  This was stated as delete in error.  They are required.  QUESTION #27:  Clarify Question 23; won’t the cable company supply the TV tuner?  You say to delete it.  The AV contractor typically needs to supply the TV tuner as the cable company will only supply the cable TV feed wire, then the AV contractor will make the connection to the TV tuner.  If you do want the cable TV company to supply the tuner, it will need to have a video and audio output in order to interface with the AV system.  ANSWER:  We have no need for a TV cable tuner.  QUESTION #28:  Clarify Question 24; will you require the Extron 8 x 8 Matrix Switcher?  You say to delete it.  This Extron 8 x 8 Switcher is needed to route all the video and audio signals to the appropriate display systems, which include the LCD Projector showing on the Smartboard screen and also the 2 NEC Plasmas.  If you delete this switcher, you will have no way of routing all the various signals to these display devices.  Virtually every multiple display system has to have some sort of switcher in order to display any of the sources, i.e.: VCR, DVD, cable TV or computers onto the multiple display devices.  I am not sure who wrote you the question, but their "engineer" must not have understood the system layout, otherwise I am certain they would agree that it is required in order to make the system work.  Each display device, i.e.: the projector, and 2 NEC plasmas, will require a video signal and a RGB signal to each of them, so 2 cables / inputs for each display device x 3 display devices = 6 outputs required from a switcher.  Since the switcher isn't available in a 6 x 6 configuration, that is why your original consultant would have specified the Extron 8 x 8 switcher.  Important note, this will also allow the end user to display a different image on all 3 of the display devices within this room. i.e.: VCR to plasma #1, computer to the LCD Projector using the Smartboard screen and either another computer or DVD or cable TV to the #2 plasma, so you could have 3 different images up on the 3 different display devices at the same time.

<DESC>The USAF Force Protection Battlelab (FPB) is exploring emerging technologies related to deployable sensors and sensor systems utilized by security personnel for remote airfield threat detection. BACKGROUND: The United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) has an Area of Responsibility (AOR) extending from the United Kingdom to the tip of South Africa. USAFE personnel may deploy to remote austere locations within the USAFE AOR in support of contingency operations and humanitarian actions. USAFE security forces require a readily deployable capability to detect threats/intrusions directed against personnel and resources operating on runways, taxiways, aircraft parking areas and other operational areas/facilities at these remote locations. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The envisioned technology would provide a maximized threat/intrusion detection capability (detection zone and detection performance) from a system that is extremely light-weight, rapidly deployable, and reliable. Ideally, this capability can be part of the individual equipment of a Security Force member and should be modular, one-person deployable. The detection system should be capable of operating with a variety of power sources to include battery, fuel cell, solar, and commercial power. Detection sensor capability may employ any feasible intrusion alert/detection technology. Sensors/equipment must be all-weather and capable of being monitored by individuals at the deployed location as well as at a central monitoring station. This capability may be stand-alone. Through this BAA, the Air Force is soliciting information to be used in a Battlelab study concerning emerging technologies available within the next 12-18 months which meet the stated capabilities. Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this initiative/study, however, if research indicates that the technology will be available and transferable to the USAF, funding may be sought for concept and/or prototype demonstration. NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement. Refer technical questions and submit product information to the AF Force Protection Battlelab technical representative: Mr. Blaise Kordell of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at kordellb@ctcnsc.org or mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935. SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 24 Oct 2003. Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file. Please use the following guidelines when submitting white papers: a) TECHNICAL APPROACH: Please provide a brief high-level description of the proposed technology (no more than 1-2 pages). Ideally, the technical approach should include a scenario illustrating the use of the proposed system. If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged (soft copies preferred). b) RISKS. Briefly address all potential risks. c) TRAINING REQUIREMENTS: Describe the type of training that will be required to operate your system? How long will the training take? Briefly summarize how personnel would deploy and operate the system. d) COMPATIBILITY: Explain system compatibility. e) ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING: State the type of environmental testing that has been performed on the system. What are the temperature and humidity limits within which the system will function properly? f) COST. What is the estimated cost or cost range of the proposed technology, including low volume production numbers and high volume production numbers? g) AVAILABILITY: Provide technology maturity/availability information h) PREVIOUS WORK: Briefly explain any previous work you have done or are doing for military/civilian customers similar to what this BAA addresses (include demonstration information that supported that work). The single point of contact concerning this Sources Sought Notice is Mr. Kordell. You may contact Mr. Kordell with any questions you may have at (814) 269-6566. Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged. GENERAL BAA INFORMATION: This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2). There shall be no formal RFP. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received. The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the technology demonstrated. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds. For copyright purposes, offerors are also advised that submitting a proposal implies express permission for Concurrent Technologies Corporation personnel to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the received proposals for the final report back to the client.

<SUBJECT>B--RANGE TELEMETRY TRACKING SYSTEM (RTTS)
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) is releasing a Request for Information (RFI) for potential vendors for a new generation Range Telemetry Tracking System (RTTS). The Western Aeronautical Test Range (WATR) has a requirement to repackage some of its range assets. NASA DFRC is interested in consolidating data gathering systems such as: telemetry (TM), video and communications.  The WATR telemetry tracking systems are capable of auto tracking targets from horizon to horizon, inside the atmosphere and orbital tracking of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) spacecraft in L and S frequency bands. These systems track both narrow and wide band telemetry, and receive downlink video signals in the L, S, and C frequency bands.  These systems also provide command up-link to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Remotely Piloted vehicles (RPV), and Remotely Augmented vehicles (RAV) in L and S band. The WATR provides omni/directional air to ground voice and data communications support in Ultra High Frequency (UHF), Very High Frequency (VHF) and a 1000 watt UHF Flight Termination System (FTS). The WATR provides both day and night high definition (720p) optical tracking. The respondents to this RFI should focus on the integration of the TM, Video and Comm. components into one compact tracking system. The integration should include the control and monitoring for each of the systems (TM, Video and Comm.) into one integrated console.

<SUBJECT>D -- Strategic War Planning Modernization (SWPS-M), Phase 2
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to inform Industry of the commencement of the Government's acquisition planning for Strategic War Planning System Modernization (SWPS-M) Phase 2 and to advise of the availability of SWPS-M, Phase 2 requirements information for Industry partners.  

The United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) operates SWPS, which is a computing environment composed of software, personal computers, workstations, servers, and networks used to build and maintain classified national war plans.  SWPS provides USSTRATCOM planners with the automated tools necessary to generate detailed information and output data used to complete the planning, simulation, analysis and production of various operational plans.  The changing political and military environments have underscored a need to modernize the current planning system.  USSTRATCOM will transform the current SWPS to implement initiatives contained in the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the FY 04-08 Defense Planning Guidance (DPG), the Unified Command Plan (UCP), and the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR).  The transformational requirements, which have been documented in an Operational Requirements Document (ORD), include the following:  1. Changes in the threat areas; 2. Changes in attack option structure and the number of options; 3.	Changes in the strategic forces and integration with regional commander forces; 4. Integration of DoD community analytical and planning applications; 5. Reduced planning timelines; 6.	Collaboration of decision-makers; 7. Changes in the force composition and reduced timelines for adaptive plans; 8. Increased workload to support theater commanders; 9. Improvements in system flexibility and responsiveness.

The current system provides support to the war planners utilizing tools that are integrated through an enterprise database.  While a systems architecture has not been defined for the transformed system, the functional architecture envisions an evolving system in which workflow is controlled through an executive manager and various plan options are generated through an optimizer.  In support of the latest Secretary of the Air Force Acquisition policy, dated 4 Jun 02, the primary mission of our acquisition system is to rapidly deliver to the warfighters affordable, sustainable capability that meets their expectations.  It is the Government's objective to develop a close relationship with Industry and Academia experts to mutually develop a best value Request For Proposal (RFP) for this upcoming potential contract effort.  The Government is pursuing a SWPS-M acquisition strategy consisting of two phases.

Phase 1 is the risk reduction effort, which consisted of a full and open competition with award to two contractors on 8 May 03.  Completion of these contracts on 29 Dec 03 will provide the Government with necessary information to complete the Milestone B decision for the Phase 2 including but not limited to software size, program planning, risks, cost drivers, schedule, staffing and a rough estimate of the Phase 2 cost.  A second objective was to minimize SWPS program cost, schedule, and performance risks.

The objective of Phase 2 is to support the Government in the actual SWPS-M development and sustainment of selected SWPS functionality and systems integration support.  Phase 2 will be a full and open competition.  

In order to support full and open competition for SWPS-M Phase 2, a capability to review SWPS-M requirements documents, technical architecture data, "As Is and To Be" models, and historical data within the USSTRATCOM SWPS Systems Integrated Product Team (IPT) has been established.  The information contains program and technical information, both UNCLASSIFIED and CLASSIFIED (up to and including SECRET) pertaining to the existing systems and contract activities for SWPS.  This information is available for all interested contractors.  Access to the information is available Monday through Friday by appointment only, excluding US Government holidays.  Contractors are cautioned that although the Government has attempted to gather current and relevant material, the Government does not represent or warrant that the material is accurate, current, or complete.  

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the assigned 55 CONS/LGCZ Contract Specialist:  Elaine DeGroot at telephone number (402) 294-3271 or E-mail Elaine.Degroot@offutt.af.mil.

Pre-Solicitation Notice of Representative Trails  

The Alaska Region of the USDA Forest Service is anticipating the issuance of a solicitation by approximately March, 2004 for the maintenance, reconstruction and construction of approximately 900 miles of National Forest System Trails throughout the Chugach and Tongass National Forests.
