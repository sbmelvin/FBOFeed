<DESC>THIS NOTICE WAS UNINTENTIONALLY ARCHIVED FROM THE FEDBIZOPPS.  THE RESPONSE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS WAS EXTENDED FROM MARCH 4, 2003 TO MAY 15, 2003.  WE ARE REPOSTING THE NOTICE.  THE RFP IS STILL AVAILABLE ON THE NIAID/CMB HOMEPAGE AT http://www.niaid.nih.gov/cgi-shl/cmb/rfps.cfm.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research related to basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines and novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and improvements in public health. As a part of the research program to improve defense against bioterrorism and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases, the NIAID seeks to establish an Administrative Center in support of the NIAID Proteomics Research Program, being solicited under a separate RFP (see RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-38). The Proteomics Research Program shall focus on early stage basic research for target discovery and identification and early validation studies. The subject solicitation is being issued as a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. The applicable NAICS code is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees. See Government-wide Numbered Note 1. As assistance to the Proteomics Research Program, the Administrative Center will: 1) Design, develop, and maintain a publicly accessible website that contains the data and technology protocols generated by each Proteomics Research site, as well as a catalog of reagents and products developed by the sites and available for public distribution; 2) Monitor and facilitate the deposition of reagents and protein targets generated by the Proteomics Research sites. It is anticipated that the Proteomics sites will deposit their reagents/products to a centralized repository such as the Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research Resource, a new program that will be supported by a separate NIAID contract for distribution to the broader research community; 3) In conjunction with the Project Officer, establish a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) composed of leading scientists knowledgeable in a broad range of proteomics and bioinformatic research areas. The committee members shall also include individuals with expertise in microbiology, immunology (both innate and adaptive immunity), and infectious diseases. The committee shall provide advice to the NIAID on the operations and future directions of the Proteomics Centers program based on the state of proteomic technological and research advances, including those contributed by the Proteomics Centers; and 4) Organize programmatic meetings and other related activities involving all of the Proteomics Research Program sites. It is anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded, with a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately September 2003. RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-45 will be available electronically on or about December 13, 2002, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract. Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with General Dynamics Robotic Systems, Incorporated, of Westminster, Maryland for one (1) each Pan/Tilt Mechanism, including hardware and software, for an experimental unmanned vehicle.  This equipment will be used by the Intelligent Systems Division for developing advanced controllers for unmanned vehicles as part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense’s (OSD) Demo III Program.  The use of this technology will allow NIST to focus on developing computer-controlled vehicles with Ladar sensors to detect terrain and avoid obstacles in order to arrive at commanded locations.
 
***Sole Source determination is based on the need for the XUV Pan/Tilt Mechanism, hardware, and software to be functionally identical to the Demo III Pan/Tilt head.  This equipment must conform electronically, mechanically, and functionally with the existing Demo III Ladar previously purchased from General Dynamics Robotic Systems.  General Dynamics Robotic Systems, Inc. is the only known manufacturer of a Pan/Tilt mechanism that will have complete compatibility with the Demo III XUV

***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 60 days after receipt of order.

***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 336322, and the size standard is 750 employees.

***No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by April 1, 2003.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
