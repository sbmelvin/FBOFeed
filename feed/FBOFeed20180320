<DESC>MULTNOMAH CREEK TRAIL BRIDGE REPLACEMENT STATEMENT OF WORK<br />This statement of work covers the replacement of a fallen tree and wild fire damaged trail bridge. The bridge is located in the CRGNSA on trail #441 at M.P. 1.9 (45.57139167, -122.10596944). By ground, the bridge is only accessible by trail. Presently the site is closed to the public. A prebid site visit date will be specified. This will be the only opportunity to visit the site during the bidding period.<br />The project to replace Multnomah Creek trail bridge includes the following elements of work to be performed:<br />1) Removal of the existing damaged trail bridge superstructure. The existing trail bridge is a 60 foot span x 3 foot wide galvanized steel truss with pressure treated wood deck bridge superstructure on cast in place concrete and concrete filled pipe abutments. The wood components of the bridge were heavily burned in the fire and most no longer exist. Only the superstructure is to be removed. The abutment substructures are to remain in-place. The damaged superstructure is to be disconnected from the substructure by removal of the anchor bolt nuts or cutting the anchor bolts as required. The superstructure will then be helicoptered out in one piece to a designated heliport.<br />2) Disposal of the existing trail bridge superstructure. The superstructure becomes the property of the Contractor and is to be removed from Government property and properly disposed of. The existing bridge plans state un-welded edges of gusset plates were to be treated with red lead primer and painted. Prior to disposal or other activities that might create dust or paint chips at the un-welded edges of the gusset plates the Contractor will have the surfaces tested for the presence of lead. It is anticipated the testing will be performed after the superstructure has been transported to the heliport. If lead is present and will increase the Contractor's disposal cost's additional compensation maybe requested.<br />3) Supply of a prefabricated steel trail bridge. The Contractor shall supply and install a steel truss configuration trail bridge in accordance with the specifications and plans. The steel trail bridge to be designed and fabricated by an established company. Submittals are required to be approved by the C.O. prior to fabrication. The steel bridge will be delivered to the designated heliport, assembled, flown into the bridge site, and placed on prepared substructures.<br />4) Supply of decay resistant wood bridge deck planks.<br />5) Supply of concrete sill substructures. The Contractor shall supply and install concrete substructures (sills) in accordance with the specifications and plans.<br />6) *ALL MECHANIZED NOISE GENERATING (HELICOPTER FLIGHTS AND POWERED HAND TOOL USE) WORK AT THE BRIDGE SITE WILL BE COMPLETED BETWEEN OCTOBER 1, 2018 - November 30, 2018. FROM MARCH 1 - OCTOBER 1 AN OWL CLOSURE IS IN EFFECT AND NO OPERATIONS THAT GENERATE LOUD NOISE WILL BE PERFORMED AT THE SITE.<br />7) Minor bridge approach work. The new bridge deck elevation will be slightly higher than the existing bridge deck elevation and require construction of bridge approaches from materials on site.
<p>THE SOLICITATION FOR THIS PROJECT WILL BE POSTED ON FBO ON OR AROUND FEBRUARY 28, 2018</p>

<DESC><strong>*** THE FULL SOLICITATION ESTIMATED ISSUE DATE:&nbsp; Electronically in Federal Business Opportunities on or about March 23, 2018. ***</strong>
<p><br />In December 2017, a rock-fall event deposited approximately 8,000 yards of very large boulders and rocky debris on Willamette National Forest Road 19 (Aufderheide Drive), near milepost 51.8. The rock-fall originated from roadside rocky cliffs on the inner (cutslope) side of the road. The road traverses the west shore of Cougar Reservoir.</p>
<p>Approximately 250 feet of road length is completely covered by the rock-fall deposit, which consists principally of 10 to 15 feet size boulders with smaller fractured material also present. The deposit is over 40 feet in height against the cliff face that constitutes the failure surface, and extends across the surface of the road prism to the outboard edge. <strong>Loose unstable material remains amongst the rock face above the rock slide deposit, rock fall hazard mitigation is required prior to future cleanup taking place.</strong></p>
<p>This work will consist of scaling (removing) material from cut slopes and rock outcrops within the failure area. Material to be removed during scaling includes: loose or detached blocks of rock, masses of soil, trees or other debris that constitutes or could constitute a hazard due to their position in relation to the roadway and work area. Work will be completed by qualified scalers using hand scaling operations with use of hand tools, that may include scaling-bars, pry-bars, picks hydraulic wedges, chainsaws, air pillows, rock breaking techniques or other mechanical means. The Contractor shall furnish all supplies, materials, labor, supervision and transportation required to complete the project.</p>
<p>The Estimated start work date is mid-April 2018, contract time estimated at 14 days. The project is 100% set aside for Small Business concerns.</p>

Westshore Boulevard Suite 400, Tampa, FL. 33607 to purchase one new license for TeamMate audit management software and four option years of software License renewal and maintenance for seven licenses. (NIST currently has a contract in place for two (2) licenses that will expire at the end of 2018. These two (2) licenses will be added to this contract as option years.)<br />NOTE: <br />*Warranty: license renewals include technical support for the period the licenses remain valid.<br />*Maintenance: license renewals include software upgrades for the period the licenses remain valid.
<p>NIST's Internal Controls and Management Evaluation Office (ICMEO) performs internal control reviews that provide the Department of Commerce and NIST senior management with objective assurance that NIST's system of internal control is adequate, operating effectively, and remains in compliance with all internal controls regulations, policies and guidance.</p>
<p>The sole source justification is based on the following:<br />1.Purchasing new audit management software would result in duplication of cost and effort.<br />2.Transitioning to new audit management software would cause significant disruptions to ICMEO's business processes including its ability to timely document and report audit results and its ability to fulfill NIST's mandatory reporting requirements under the Federal Manager's Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) and the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Circular A-123, Management's Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Controls.<br />3.Transitioning to new audit management software would cause unnecessary risks associated with data migration.</p>
<p>Market research has shown that Wolters Kluwer is the sole entity permitted to license TeamMate; therefore, Wolters Kluwer is the only source available to provide the required software.</p>
<p>The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price purchase order. The NAICS Code is 511210 with a size standard of $38.5 Million<br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration. Responses received by 10:00 AM ET on Tuesday, April 03,2018, will be considered by the Government.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure contractor services to support recruitment of study volunteers from families with specific mental illnesses within Amish and Mennonite communities, perform structured diagnostic and other mental health assessments in the field, help to design and improve clinical assessment tools and establish their validity among individuals of Amish or Mennonite ancestry, and collect blood and other biological specimens in the field for use in molecular analyses. While most of the tasks will be performed by the contractor, qualified subcontractors may be engaged as needed.
<p><br />The Genetic Basis of Mood and Anxiety Disorders Section, within the Human Genetics Branch, NIMH-IRP, is a clinical genetics research program with both human-subjects and laboratory components. Our leadership position depends critically on recruitment of family study volunteers, competent performance of structured diagnostic assessments in the field, refinement of diagnostic procedures, and the collection of research specimens. Ongoing research is focused on volunteers of Amish or Mennonite ancestry, who must usually be ascertained, enrolled, and assessed in the field.</p>

<DESC>The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) conducts scientific research on fish stocks, fish habitats, and the chemistry of marine environments throughout Alaskan Marine Waters. Information from this research is widely used by commercial interests such as fishing industries, and governmental agencies involved in managing natural resources.  This research relies upon marine survey data on commercially marketable species such as rockfish, sablefish, forage fish, and salmon which is then turned into information products essential to fishing industries, state and federal regulators. The goal of these survey efforts is to address the objectives within NOAA's mission scope by providing information on how species distribution and marine food webs are altered by changes in the environment throughout Alaskan marine waters.
<p><br />The AFSC has a requirement for a contractor to provide charter operations from about late July to early October (five months) during the base period in 2018 and from June to October of each of four option periods immediately following the base period. The base period time and location will be dependent on surveys chosen for  each contract period. Work will typically occur out of ports like Dutch Harbor, Nome, Juneau, and Sitka but maybe as far north as Barrow Alaska. Length of sea legs will vary depending on work and location and associated research projects and will be determined by the field party chief in conjunction with the contractor.

<p><br />Anticipated Issue Date: 28 JUL 2017 - Anticipated Closing Date: 25 AUG 2017 - 2:00 PM EST</p>
<p>A Solicitation will NOT be posted to Fed Biz Opps due to its sole source nature. The draft agreement will be issued directly to the Curtiss Wright Controls Electronic Systems, In. on 28 July 2017.</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT - Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane has a requirement to award a five-year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) for repair, rework, and maintenance support for the Airborne Mission Processor (AMP) Weapon Replaceable Assemblies (WRA), Shop Replaceable Assemblies (SRA) and sub-assemblies as well as Engineering Support Services, Test Program Set (TPS) Development, Research and Development, Test and Evaluation, Redesign and Modification, Training, Data collection, Logistics Support Services, Procurement of Spares and Travel in support of the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft (MPRA) PMA-290 and Persistent Maritime Unmanned Aircraft Systems (PMUAS) PMA-26 systems. Services required are for engineering and logistics support, repairs, upgrades, training, and for logistics support services. Job Orders shall be within scope, issued within ordering period, and be within the maximum total dollar value of approximately $12,500,000 over a five-year period. Each Job Order will be synopsized.</p>
<p>The proposed Agreement is for the supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source, Curtiss Wright Controls Electronic Systems, Inc., 28965 Ave Penn, Santa Clarita, CA 91355-4185, under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)), only one responsible source. The basis for restricting competition is the lack of sufficient technical data and duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. The duplicative cost and delay are comprised from the cost to procure, re-tool, reverse engineer, generate acceptance test procedures, perform first article testing, acquire flight certification, underway for sub-surface platforms, and perform stress analysis, which would take a minimum of 3-5 years for development, production, and verification.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this draft agreement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Curtiss Wright Controls Electronic Systems, Inc. directly.</p>
<p>The anticipated Agreement award date is First Quarter Fiscal Year (18). A Solicitation will NOT be posted to Fed Biz Opps due to the sole source nature of the action.</p>
<p>The point of contact at NSWC Crane is Ms. Heidi Slaubaugh, Code 0233, at telephone (812) 854-2604 or e-mail: <a href="mailto:heidi.slaubaugh@navy.mil">heidi.slaubaugh@navy.mil</a>.&nbsp; The mailing address is: Ms. Heidi Slaubaugh, Code 0233, Bldg. 3373 Room 223C113, NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522-5001.

<SUBJECT>Wheel Halves for the MK-105

<DESC>The Government intends to award on a sole source basis toParker Hannifin Corporation (CAGE Code 59211) to acquire the following items:
<p>Wheel Half, Outer 162-17400 50 each<br />Wheel Half, Inner 161-17400 50 each</p>
<p><br />10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, FAR 6.302-1. This procurement is sole source for the following reasons. Parker-Hannifin is the sole designer and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the wheel halves. As such, they hold the intellectual property rights and have the sole rights to fabricate the wheels and establish technical requirements for its components. There have been no other contractual actions related to the direct development of the MK 105 since award of the system development and demonstration contract. No other source has the access, knowledge, or requisite production experience necessary to produce the required assemblies. Because of the lack of data and proprietary rights, selection of another vendor would require extensive, costly and time consuming reverse engineering and there is no guarantee that this would be successful as these assemblies are form, fit, function integrated into the aforementioned systems. Any changes to these wheels that may be caused by selection of another vendor may adversely affect the overall performance of MK-105 System. These drawings, design, and components of these wheels are owned by Parker Hannifin. Any redesign or reverse engineering will require significant government time and expense which is not reasonable considering the relatively low quantity of wheels needed and it is not expected to be recovered through competition. Therefore, it is in the Government's best interest to purchase these wheel assemblies from Parker Hannifin Corporation. No additional market research was conducted because it is not practicable, for the reasons discussed. The Contracting Officer has determined that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs. See attached clauses.</p>

<p>The scope of this procurement is to cover the United State Forces Korea (USFK), Foreign Military Sales, United States Department of State, and DoD facilities within the Republic of Korea (ROK). Representative types of facilities or structures that may be the subject of design or planning services include training and operations structures; administrative buildings; unaccompanied and accompanied family military housing; dining facilities; hospitals, medical/dental clinics; communications facilities; fuel storage and dispensing facilities; religious and family facilities; athletic facilities: gymnasiums, multiple-purpose sports fields; airfield structures and pavements; and utility systems that may include communications, power, water, gas, and sewers. Blast hardening, Collective Protection System (CPS) and Chemical Biological Radiological (CBR) protection may be required for some facilities. Sustainable Design/LEED and Energy Policy Act 2005 requirements will be required for all facilities. Design deliverables must address local construction methods in the ROK and approved local materials that meet the intent of U.S. standards and code criteria in order to facilitate the use of local methods and materials. All design documents must be based on metric system units. Designs and prepared drawings must be accomplished using Computer-Added Design (CAD) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) and shall be compliant with the current A/E/C CAD standard available from the CAD/BIM Technology Center, USACE Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC).</p>

<p>Special Notice</p>
<p>UTM-FY2018</p>
<p>NOTE: This is a reposting of UTM01112017, which has been archived. Individuals or groups who responded to UTM01112017, UTM01112016 or UTM09032014 do not need to resubmit to this notice.</p>
<p>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) is hereby requesting information through this notice from interested parties for the following:</p>
<p>NASA seeks to identify U.S.-based public, private, and academic organizations to collaborate with NASA to conduct Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) and UAS Traffic Management (UTM) research and development with the collective goal of safely enabling these operations at lower altitudes by UTM system. The collaboration will involve participating in future UTM technical capability levels. This notice also solicits interested parties' questions, comments, suggestions, clarifications, and any data that would help the agency prepare for such collaboration. There will be no funds exchanged between NASA and collaborating parties.</p>
<p>Potential collaborators who may consider responding include:</p>
<p>UAS manufacturers, Personal aircraft vehicle manufacturers, UAS avionics and middleware industry representatives, UAS operators: Cargo Delivery, Precision Agriculture, and other UAS start up and mature companies, Software companies supporting UAS operations, Sensor manufacturers, Communication/navigation/surveillance providers, System integrators, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) UAS test sites, Universities, academicians, researchers, Satellite communication, surveillance, tracking systems industry, System integrators, UAS Mission planning software systems, Ground station system developers, and Others who have capabilities to enable low altitude airspace operations.</p>
<p>The final product of these tests will result in a working prototype UTM system and documentation of results that demonstrate how the low-altitude airspace and UAS operations could be safely enabled for the entire stakeholder community and national benefit.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The goals of the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) include enabling large-scale, safe UAS operations in low-altitude airspace.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this document, UTM is focused on operations in Class G airspace (initially 400 feet AGL and below).</p>
<p>The UAS Traffic Management Project within ARMD's Airspace Operations and Systems Program has been conducting simulations and field tests in levels of increasing capability to enable diverse vehicles, operations, and scenarios/missions at these altitudes. This research requires collaborating with many entities such as manufacturers; operators that include retailers, search and rescue, firefighting, science, and academia, etc.; communication, navigation, and surveillance system designers, airspace system developers, and system integrators; and FAA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), FAA test sites, etc.</p>
<p>BENEFITS</p>
<p>The product of these field tests will be beneficial to all collaborating parties, NASA researchers, the FAA, the NOAA and National Weather Service (NWS), academia, UAS manufacturers and applications industry, avionics industry, and policy makers.</p>
<p>Collaborating parties receive valuable performance data about their assets and ability to operate in the mixed airspace.</p>
<p>NASA will test the algorithms and UTM capabilities to safely enable low altitude operations and operational requirements for wind/weather integration, airspace design/geo-fencing, sense-and-avoid/separation management, demand/capacity imbalance management, contingency management, and enabling requirements such as communications, navigation, and surveillance.</p>
<p>Policy makers receive data to support the understanding of procedures, safety processes, and options for safe management of the low altitude airspace.</p>
<p>ASSUMPTIONS</p>
<p>Interested parties can assume the following:</p>
<p>1. NASA will lead the development of the test objectives and schedule with the goal of conducting tests that are diverse in nature, both in terms of vehicle capabilities and applications. NASA will coordinate with the FAA for information and technology assessments.</p>
<p>2. The more the credible number of collaborators, the richer and more representative the tests, data, and results will be. Therefore, NASA has not a-priori set a limit on the number of collaborators.</p>
<p>3. All vehicles will have to go through the NASA Airworthiness process and/or demonstrate proof of process and airworthiness review conducted by the vehicle manufacturer or operator.</p>
<p>4. NASA will bear the costs involved in logistics of conducting tests, data collection, analysis, and report generation as well as UTM build development. However, NASA will not be acquiring or paying for the UAS, collaborating parties personnel involved in preparation of the tests, and activities associated with collaboration.</p>
<p>5. NASA Office of Chief Counsel will require each collaborating party to sign a Release Form. Generally, the Release Form will require collaborating parties to waive all claims against the U.S. Government and to indemnify the U.S. Government against third-party claims, for all NASA-sponsored activities during the UTM collaboration. The Release Form will also address the release of UTM test data to collaboration parties and the protection of collaborating parties' proprietary data.</p>
<p>6. Collaborating parties will be required to provide proof of insurance having reasonable coverage amounts set by NASA. Also, collaborating parties will assume liability for any damage and injuries caused by their personnel or equipment.</p>
<p>7. Depending on the business use/missions/scenarios, some vehicles and associated missions may not be used in these collaborative tests.</p>
<p>8. Tests will be conducted at locations that are legally acceptable for the UTM testing.</p>
<p>9. Based on the test conditions and vehicle/scenario mix, NASA (and support contractors) will request Certificate of Authorization (COA) to conduct these tests.</p>
<p>10. NASA will develop UTM technical capability levels that will be incorporated in the field-testing. Further, NASA may use live, virtual, constructive environment to increase the complexity of the test conditions and scenarios.</p>
<p>11. NASA (or NASA-appointed contractors) will collect data and results related to UTM, which will be shared with all stakeholders that are involved in the study. Common data regarding overall results of the test will be shared with the FAA and all participants in the test. Vehicle or proprietary capability-specific data (e.g., accuracy of flying trajectories) will be provided only to the collaborating party responsible for that vehicle or capability.</p>
<p>12. NASA will be the arbiter for balancing the needs of various stakeholders.<br /><br />13. As needed, further tests involving the models of cities or urban areas will be created and tested.</p>
<p>RESPONSES</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to respond to this notice with an information package. The information packages may be submitted at any time while this notice is active and shall be submitted via email only to arc-cal-utm-rfi@mail.nasa.gov. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and must be clearly marked.</p>
<p>The information package shall be limited to two (2) pages and shall include the following, at a minimum:</p>
<p>--Name, address, and nationality (state/country of registration) of your business entity.</p>
<p>--Name and contact information, including e-mail, for your technical POC for this collaboration.</p>

<DESC><strong>Title: Mission Support for the Preparation of Toxicological Profiles</strong>
<p><strong>Introduction<br /></strong>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services, with a size standard of $15 million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />This procurement is entitled Mission Support Services for the Preparation of Toxicological Profiles and associated documents. Profiles are developed in response to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 which amended the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA or Superfund). Under the authority of Section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) Section 104, as amended by Section 110 (P.L. 99 499) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are required to establish guidelines for the development of toxicological profiles. The development of toxicological profiles and other scientific documents continue to support federal, state and local health professionals, public health assessors, and numerous groups and individuals in understanding the potential for human exposure to various hazardous substances. Profiles are required to be released by October 17th of each year.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of Work</strong><br />The objective of this procurement is to develop an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to support ATSDR in the preparation of profiles and associated documents on hazardous substances found at facilities on the EPA National Priorities List. Substances for profile development are selected from the ATSDR Substance Priority List (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/spl/index.html). Other substances not on the list may also be selected based on the public health needs as determined by ATSDR. Support provided under this procurement may include coordination of the production of the profile, as well as analysis, technical assistance, support concerning projects directly related to the development of the profiles and significant human exposure levels (SHELs) or Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) and other scientific documents. The profile must also focus on important data needs that preclude the determination of significant levels of human exposure or contribute substantially to the uncertainty of such levels. The quality of such data must be assessed and in order to support the determination of levels of significant human exposure and, where major gaps in the supporting data exist, identify those data needs in the toxicological profiles.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objective<br /></strong>Under Section 104 of CERCLA as amended by Section 110 of SARA, the toxicological profiles must contain, at a minimum, the following information:</p>
<p>An examination, summary, and interpretation of available toxicological information and epidemiologic evaluations on a hazardous substance in order to ascertain the levels of significant human exposure for the substance and the associated acute, subchronic, and chronic health effects.</p>
<p>A determination of whether adequate information on the health effects of each substance is available or in the process of development to determine levels of exposure which present a significant risk to human health of acute, subchronic, and chronic health effects.</p>
<p>Where appropriate, an identification of toxicological testing needed to identify the types or levels of exposure that may present significant risk of adverse health effects in humans.</p>
<p>Under the provisions of CERCLA, Section 104 as amended by SARA, Section 110, ATSDR has sole responsibility for the development and publication of all toxicological profiles and will sponsor the work and serve as project oversight. In addition, the profile will undergo an independent peer review and be made available in draft form to the public for comment. ATSDR will be referred to as the Government in the work requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements<br /></strong>ATSDR requires the following technical and general requirements:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Requirements<br /></span>1. Conduct the review and develop evaluations of available research and analysis in specific subject areas.

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is seeking procurement alternatives and sources to provide the support services to meet these requirements. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Sources Sought Notice or any follow up information requests. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from industry sources as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.

Any information submitted to the Sources Sought Notice (e.g. capability statement) is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC 552 (a).
<p>Through the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 and the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) received authority to establish a federal-based program to secure reinsurance from the private reinsurance and capital markets to better provide claims coverage for the NFIP. FIMA is currently working to continue to implement this program. A program of this nature is fairly new to the federal government, and reinsurance is a specialized area of the law. As a result, FIMA requires legal subject-matter-experts to advise and assist on matters related to the reinsurance law and the reinsurance industry.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) has a requirement to build a 11,000 - 12,000 sq feet Recycling Center using storage containers. The Industry Day will be held on April 17, 2018 at 9:00am at B93 on FLETC, 1131 Chapel Crossing Road, Glynco, Georgia 31524. To register for this event, please submit the name(s) of the person(s), company name, and confirmation that proposed attendees are US Citizens Terrence.Johnson@fletc.dhs.gov. who will be attending this event. Due to limited space, only the first 30 people to register will be allowed to attend. The max personnel per company is 2-3 people. Deadline for registration is April 11, 2018.
<p>Vendors will be provided an overview of the FLETC Mission, Security Briefing, Environmental &amp; Safety Briefing, and a Tour of the FLETC Glynco facilities. Vendors are encouraged to submit questions relevant to the Industry Day by April 10, 2018 so that an opportunity is provided to address questions in an open forum.</p>
<p>Listed below are brief requirements questions for this requirement?</p>
<p>Regarding the use of storage containers to construct a warehouse building,&nbsp; The government would want to know more about the following:</p>
<p>How can recycled modular storage containers be reconfigured to construct a warehouse building with an average net square footage of approximately 11,000 to 12,000 net square feet of building space.</p>
<p>How can such containers (with typical sizes of 8' wide by 8.5' high by lengths of either 40' or 20') be assembled to construct such a building. Would some have to be cut to fit. How would they be integrated with a concrete slab on grade foundation. As this building is envisioned to be a recycling building and would incorporate feeding recycled materials into a hopper for compaction, how would a pit for collection of recyclables be incorporated into a concrete slab on grade foundation.</p>
<p>If the containers were to be stacked three (3) high, how would they be made structurally sound to function as building walls.<br /><br />How would a slope roof with a minimum pitch of 12:1 be placed atop the building. How would the containers at ground level be modified to create storage space within the container. How would the containers at the second and third levels be treated, i.e. open space, filled for insulation, used for storage and if so how accessed.</p>
<p>How would such a building be energized to provide for lighting and ceiling fans.</p>
<p>How would doorways be incorporated into such a structure to allow for vehicle drive through the building, personnel to enter into and exit the building, and to provide space for a hopper that would feed a bailer located in another building.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact Terrence Johnson</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.</strong> It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) CODE</strong>:<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334510 - ELECTROMEDICAL AND ELECTROTHERAPEUTIC APPARATUS MANUFACTURING.</p>
<p>The related small business size standard for this NAICS code is 1,250 employees or fewer.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Need and Purpose</strong>: The purpose of this acquisition is to upgrade existing microarray recording equipment at the Functional and Restorative Neurosurgery Unit (FRNU) within the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Sroke with the ability to safely administer electrical stimulation to the human brain. The NINDS currently utilizes a Blackrock Microsystems NeuroPort recording and acquisition system with 128-channel neural signal processing units, a pneumatic inserter and digital hubs for Blackrock Microsystems CerePlex I headstages.  NINDS has a requirement for equipment that will interface with an implantable device used to record neurological signals from and administer stimulation to the human brain. Arrays are requested to have micro-stimulation capability, stimulated by a Blackrock Microsystems CereStim R96 stimulator (or comparable equipment).  The equipment will be installed by NINDS once service to build the equipment is completed.</p>
<p><br />The ability to administer stimulation is a requirement for the Functional and Restorative Neurosurgery Unit laboratory's research experiments, which aim to decipher the neural code of human memory.   The FRNU laboratory at NINDS depends upon microarrays to capture information from 10 to 150 individual human neurons at once.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Background Information and Objective</strong>:  The Functional and Restorative Neurosurgery Unit (FRNU) of NINDS exploits the unique investigative opportunities provided by intracranial electrical recordings during neurosurgical procedures. Using recordings captured from epilepsy patients implanted with subdural and depth electrodes, we investigate the activation of cortical networks during memory encoding and recall, and using the recordings captured during the implantation of deep brain stimulators, we investigate the role of the basal ganglia in learning and decision making.</p>
<p><strong>Generic Name of Product</strong>:  High Density Microarray Upgrade with Micro-Stimulation for Neurological Recording Equipment</p>
<p><strong>Contract Type</strong>:</p>
<p>A firm-fixed price type contract is anticipated for this acquisition.</p>

<p>Recently, Blackrock Microsystems has developed a proprietary method for administering low-levels of electrical stimulation to individual micro-array channels, and NINDS would like to upgrade its existing Blackrock Microsystems arrays to make use of this new technology. In order to ensure continuity of ongoing research experiments, it is imperative that (1) no component of NINDS' existing Blackrock Microsystems neural recording system is changed during the upgrade, and (2) that the microstimulation system integrates with NINDS' existing Blackrock neural recording equipment. For these reasons, Blackrock Microsystems is the only vendor capable of providing the service to enhance NINDS' existing arrays with stimulation capability.</p>

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition</strong>. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) CODE</strong>:<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 325120 - INDUSTRIAL GAS MANUFACTURING.  The small business size standard for this NAICS code is 1,000 or fewer employees.</p>
<p><strong>Background Information:</strong><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.<br /> <br />The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducting research into the cause, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders. The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Need and Purpose</strong>: Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity-type contract with a 12-month (one year) base ordering period and with four successive 12-month (one year) term option ordering periods (total possible ordering period of 5 years) for liquid helium to supply the 11.7T animal MRI magnet scanner housed at the NINDS Laboratory of Functional and Molecular Imaging.</p>
<p><strong>Background Information and Objective:</strong> <br />The Laboratory of Functional and Molecular Imaging is home to an ultra-high magnetic field 11.7T animal MRI scanner with a 31 cm bore, one of the highest field magnets with such a large bore in the world.  To maintain this field, the magnet windings are immersed in liquid helium, and then held in a vacuum to lower the temperature to around 2 Kelvin.  This enables the magnet to operate in a superconducting state at this high field.</p>
<p>The vacuum and continuous boiloff of the liquid helium requires that the helium be refilled periodically.  For this magnet, the volume required for refilling is 350 liters, which is required approximately every three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>NINDS anticipates establishing an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity-type contract with a one-year Base ordering period with four successive 12-month Term Option ordering periods for a total possible ordering period of 5 years.&nbsp; Delivery Orders will be placed as needs arise and are antcipated to be firm fixed price.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Delivery quantity is typically 350 Liter Dewars per delivery which typically occur every 3 to 4 weeks.  Vendor will deliver helium, NINDS staff will fill the magnet, and on the next delivery the vendor will pick up the empty tank.</p>
<p>The guaranteed minimum order quantity shall be one order of one 350 liter Dewar of liquid helium.</p>
<p>The maximum order quantity will be 85 deliveries and 29,750 liters of liquid helium.  However, no more than 5,950 liters will be ordered per year.</p>
<p>Required delivery lead time is 7 days after receipt of order.</p>
<p>There may be times where expedited or emergency delivery is required (anticipated no more than twice per year).  Delivery charges for emergency deliveries (within 24 hours of receipt of order) will be made part of the Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity contract as separate line items to be included in individual delivery orders as applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Generic Name of Product</strong>:  Liquid Helium</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Salient characteristics</span></strong>:</p>
<p>1.	The contractor shall provide 350 Liter Dewar's of liquid helium per delivery (exact quantity to be determined per Delivery Order).  Liquid helium is liquefied gas and presents a cryogenic burn risk (frostbite).  Dewars should be MRI compatible (i.e. non-magnetic).  Dewar should also have electric pressure builder.<br />2.	Dewar's of this gas shall be handled by trained and certified personnel. <br />3.	The Dewars shall be stored outdoors in well ventilated area.  One 350 liter helium tank is needed approximately every 3 weeks.  This can vary somewhat due to difference in the boiloff from the magnet, related to atmospheric conditions and usage of the magnet.  <br />4.	Tanks are delivered and picked up at the following location:</p>
<p>National Institutes of Health<br />Building 10, B1NMR loading dock, <br />9000 Rockville Pike<br />Bethesda, MD  20892</p>
<p>Generally, NINDS will have no more than one 350-liter dewar per Delivery Order, with a maximum of 17 Delivery Orders per annum, approximately one every 3 weeks   However, on occasion NINDS may go up to 4 weeks between fills.  The maximum number of liters NINDS will need annually is 5,950.  Boiloff can be higher and fills may not be as efficient as expected, requiring more helium.  The total amount of helium shall not exceed 5,950 liters during any one year for the period of performance of the contract.  Total maximum delivery quantity under the contract will be 29,750 liters.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Delivery Date:</strong> Average of one delivery per month, every 3-4 weeks.  It is possible that we will need to add an additional delivery, or that we will not need a delivery.  Typically, the vendor is called the week before helium is required in order to schedule delivery.  The project officer of the contract will advise the contractor if there is a change in the delivery schedule.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Period of Performance:</strong> <br />Base year: 						June 1, 2018 - May 31, 2019<br />Option Year 1						June 1, 2019 - May 31, 2020<br />Option Year 2						June 1, 2020 - May 31, 2021<br />Option Year 3						June 1, 2021 - May 31, 2022<br />Option Year 4						June 1, 2022 - May 31, 2023</p>

<div>Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic, and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease.  A fully serviced lease is required.  Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.</div>
<p>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under a lease in Alexandria, Virginia, that will be expiring.  The current lease contains one 5 year renewal option. The Government intends to exercise the renewal term prior to the end of the existing term.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

SCOPE OF WORK   BEFORE DESIGN GUIDE 

The following improvements and updates will need to be made to the Prototype, Space Planning Criteria, and Equipment Guide List prior to conversion into the Design Guide. 

Confirm and update information, as necessary. to address staff offices and workstation spaces and sizes as part of the  Reduce-the-Footprint  initiative, to align the Prototype spaces and work areas with the allowable square footage per VA policy.  This information has been updated in the PG-18-9 Space Planning Criteria Chapters currently posted on the TIL. 

Hold six (6) working group meetings attended by CFM, VHA Advisors, and contract A/Es who have experience working with the Prototype in order to obtain feedback, lessons learned, and best practices on the process, the prototype design, and the outcomes.  These working group meetings will either be held in conjunction with the travel described in this SOW, or will be held virtually or a combination of both.  No travel will be required for working group meetings alone.  Create a list of suggested changes to the Prototype for approval by CFM.  Upon approval, implement the approved changes into the new Design Guide.  Ensure that the following subject matters are addressed:

Two-story designs
Daylighting opportunities for staff work areas and other work area improvement ideas.
Space modularity concepts that facilitate the ability to  plug  optional functional programs into the planning/design framework 
Opportunities to reduce patient and staff walking distances
Opportunities to reduce the factor between net usable square feet (NSUF) and gross square feet (GSF), which will assist VA in reducing its costs per NUSF
Differences between the criteria to be used in the Build-to-Suit Design Guide and the Outpatient Clinic Leases of Existing Space Design Guide 
Analyze the width of the  Teamwork Zone  to determine the most efficient dimension based on FTEs per NSF

Create a new prototype design for a CBOC of 100,000 NUSF (CBOC   100K) for use in all Design Guide Chapters 1 and 2 (as defined in item I, C, above).  And a new prototype design for a CBOC of 10,000 NUSF (CBOC   10K) for use in the Design Guide chapters for VA owned outpatient clinics and outpatient clinics in existing lease space.

Work with subject-matter experts (SMEs) to refine the definition of NUSF and apply that definition to all Prototype designs to yield an NUSF for each design as well as a rentable square feet (RSF) number (to be calculated based on General Services Administration (GSA) standards) in addition to GSF.  Produce a floor plan for each design that has NUSF and RSF visually highlighted.  Analyze the effectiveness of using NUSF and create a set of pros, cons, and recommendations as to VA switching or converting to another space measurement standard that is more widely used by Federal agencies. 

Update abbreviations to show current VA abbreviation convention (see recent Design Guide (DG) updates on the TIL). Abbreviations shall contain VA standard definitions as well as those pertaining to PACT / CBOC services specifically.  Legends and Symbols shall comply with current National CADD Standards and mirror those in recent DG updates. 

Create a section of the Design Guide that sets forth an equation or other means of calculating the necessary acreage to situate each Prototype design, based on NUSF, the number of parking spaces required, and site circulation. This information will be used by VA when advertising its requirements for leased facilities.  

In the Design Guide, expand and elaborate on Section 8: Off-Site Construction Methods and if any impact on the Prototype designs. 

Advise and provide VA with recommendations of any current and future healthcare trends, codes, and construction practices relevant to this work.

Provide and analysis of applicable codes and related critical issues that may critically effect the revision of the documents in this work. 

Update PG 18-9   Space Planning Space Criteria Chapter 265 for PACT / Outpatient Clinic Services: 

1. Space Criteria update development shall be  based on current VA Policies, Directives, and Handbooks, lessons learned as stated above, the latest work of this nature being developed in the private sector healthcare market, including all applicable guidelines, codes, and standards for this facility type.

The current Space Criteria was established with a baseline metric that the core  PACT  module contains four (4) Teamlets.  This baseline metric will be evaluated as part of this project as information from current operating sites indicates that 5 five (5) or six (6) teamlets per PACT Module may represent a more efficient operating model.  

The revised Space Planning Criteria Chapter shall allow of the sizing of the individual specialty services based on workload, staffing, and mission.  The current chapter is based on  one  size for the specialty service for the  One PACT  Prototype, another specific size for the  Two PACT  Prototype and so on.  This has not proven to be an effective programming methodology on projects designed to date.    
 
The Space Planning Criteria Chapter shall maintain the following organization:
Section 1 - Purpose and Scope.
Section 2   Definitions.
Section 3   Operating Rationale and Basis of Criteria
Section 4   Program Data Required (Input Data Questions).
Section 5   Space Criteria.
Section 6   Planning and Design Considerations.
Section 7   Functional Relationships
Section 8 -  Functional Diagram(s)

Section 1: Purpose and Scope:  update to reflect the functionality of the Outpatient Clinic (OPC) / Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC).

Section 2: Definitions: update to reflect the scope of definitions as contained in recent chapter updates and to include any OPC / CBOC specific definitions as appropriate.

Organize Definitions into those that are  General  planning, design, operational terms and  Specific  definitions that are specific to CBOCs and Outpatient Clinics

Section 3: Operating Rationale and Basis of Criteria: Confirm the Operating Rationale and Basis of Criteria  based on an assessment of the current VA PACT and Community Based Outpatient Clinic Policies and Directives and including all applicable guidelines for these services, in collaboration with VHA Advisors.

Section 4: Program Data Required will be developed by the A/E contracted to implement the Space Criteria into SEPS and is not included in this SOW.

Section 5: Space Criteria, i.e. Room/Space list, contained in this Section shall be ordered based on the typical functional area structure as contained in Chapters currently on the TIL. (see Item E, 4, below) 
Every room/space shall have a unique Room Code (RC) coordinated with the room codes currently in Space Criteria Chapters and in the Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) as well as an appropriate Room Name (RN) reflective of the function of the room.  Recently completed Space Planning Criteria Chapters will be utilized as the basis for all room naming conventions (see Item E, 4, below), i.e., for new rooms being added and to coordinate existing room names remaining. In cases where there is the need to create new RCs; the Consultant shall provide a temporary placeholder room code determined in conjunction with the project team for this Task Order.
   
For every room/space in Section 5 of the chapter, provide the following:
Room Name.
Room Code, using either an existing room code or a temporary placeholder room code
Net room/space area in both imperial and metric units - Net Square Feet (NSF) or Net Square Meter (NSM). Net room/space area is defined as the  floor area inside of wall/partition .
Room/Space Criteria Statements:  The room/space criteria statements (shall be provided in italics text) shall be driven by mission, workload, and staffing inputs developed through collaboration with the VHA Advisors and CFM. 

Example of room/space criteria statement:  Minimum NSF; provide an additional 60 NSF for every increment of four Operating Rooms (of any type) greater than four .  

Room Comments/Descriptions (non-space criteria related) shall be provided in block text as needed.  The room comments are provided to confirm/clarify the specific function for a room/space. 

Example of Room Comment/Description:  This space will be designed as a place for patients, family and staff to obtain resources, learn more about a patient s condition, access the internet and email, read, relax, and conduct personal business .

Section 6: Planning and Design Considerations shall be developed to provide key considerations in summary type format that are deemed key to PACT and  Outpatient Clinic services; such as the Departmental Net to Gross (DNTG) factor, along with any additional information relative to the chapter.

Section 7: Functional Relationships matrix shall be reviewed with the Project Team and identify key relations as determined by the team.  These Functional Relationships shall be those required within a Community Based Outpatient Clinic.

Section 8: Functional Diagrams shall be conceptual representations of the interrelationship of the Functional Areas (FAs) and key rooms/spaces.

The Consultant shall develop room  test-fits  showing all room/space equipment and room contents to illustrate and confirm the size of the room identified will accommodate the room/space functional needs.  The room  test-fit  (RTF) diagrams can be utilized as the basis for the Room Templates in Section IV, B., below, at the Consultants choosing.  Each RTF shall contain the floor plan of the room/space, with the room contents (equipment, furniture, and furnishings, etc.) drawn to scale and notated to match the PG-18-5.  The RTF shall be properly labeled with the Room Code, Room Name, and scale. The RTF shall illustrate all appropriate clearances, turning radii, door swings, etc.
 
Implementation of the space criteria into SEPS and the development of Program Data Required and Data Input Statements will be based on the new room condition format developed during CY2017.  The Consultant is expected to understand and implement the revised space criteria based on this new VA format.  Information on this format will be provided prior to project commencement.   
The Consultant will provide  reasonable/realistic  answers to the Data Input Statements for three projects (small, medium and large).  A SEPS Program for Design will be run using this input data for the three projects to obtain space projection results.  
The Consultant shall review the results of these test projects with VHA and CFM representatives and reach a consensus relative to the reasonableness of the test results.

Revise and update PG 18-5   Equipment Guide List:

The PG 18-5 update shall include the content assignments i.e. the list of furniture, medical equipment, and furnishings for each Room Code. 
 
The Consultant shall collaborate with the VHA Advisors and CFM in confirming, updating, and/or developing the Equipment/Room Contents Guide List for every unique Room Code in the Space Planning Criteria Chapter. Provide the following information for all equipment items:   

Unique JSN Item Name
Unique JSN Number (placeholder JSN#)
Item quantity (in the room/space)
Item Acquisition / Installation code (Logistical Category)
Item Description

For each new equipment/room contents item a  placeholder  JSN will be included in the spreadsheet.  Final JSNs will assigned by CFM s Equipment Specialist as the work progresses.  

Identify three (3) manufacturer for each new item as  representative  of or as an  or equal  for all new or updated items. Provide  cut-sheets  from each manufacturer and retail cost data.






SCOPE OF WORK   DESIGN GUIDE 

The following work comprises the creation of the Design Guide from all the aforementioned work and resources.

Update and Refine Prototype for Standardized Design and Construction of Outpatient Clinics / Community Based Outpatient Clinics into a  TIL  version Design Guide.  The Consultant shall develop a single new Design Guide containing chapters / sections for: 

 1. Build-to-suit leased outpatient clinics; 2. Owned outpatient clinics; 3. Outpatient clinic leases of existing space; 4. Standard information applicable to Chapters 1, 2, and 3.

Build-to-Suit (BTS) Leased Outpatient Clinics:  The Consultant shall develop a Chapter for Design Guide information for BTS Leased Outpatient Clinics.  The BTS Lease Chapter is aimed at providing information to VA staff, A/E consultants, and lessors/developers for design and construction of leased OPCs / CBOCs.  The BTS Lease Chapter will incorporate relevant sections of the existing Lease-Based Outpatient Clinic Design Guide but will not contain the template Solicitation for Offers document contained in that design guide.  It will conform to best practices for leased facilities and set forth federal and industry minimum requirements as deemed acceptable by VA / CFM.  The BTS Lease Chapter must conform to the standards and specifications that VA is setting forth in its Solicitation for Offers document.  The new BTS Lease Chapter will be based on the Prototype, updated as described in this SOW, and shall include the following content described in Item B below. 
 
Owned Outpatient Clinics: The Consultant shall develop a Chapter for Owned Outpatient Clinics (ODC).  The ODC Chapter is aimed at providing information for the design and construction of stand-alone Owned Outpatient Clinics, or an Outpatient Clinic that is incorporated into a VA Medical Center.  The Owned Outpatient Clinic Chapter will be a new document, based on the Prototype, updated as described in this SOW, and shall include the content described in Item B below.

Existing Space Leased Outpatient Clinics: The Consultant shall develop a Design Guide Chapter for Existing Space Leased Outpatient Clinics.  The Existing Lease Design Guide (ELDG) is aimed at providing information to VA staff, A/Consultants, and lessors/developers for design and construction of leased Outpatient Clinics that take place through renovation of existing space. The ELDG Chapter will be a new document that operates in concert with the most recent General Services Administration (GSA) lease documents i.e. the Request for Lease Proposals.  It will conform to best practices for leased facilities and set forth federal and industry minimum requirements as deemed acceptable by VA / CFM.  The new ELDG Chapter will be based on the Prototype, updated as described in this SOW , and shall include the content described in Item B below. 

The Design Guide (DG) provides functional and technical planning and design information in narrative format and detailed information for a selected number of rooms/spaces in the Clinic, and is aimed at providing information to VA staff and A/E consultants developing a construction project for a VA.  This DG will be a variation of the standard DG formats currently on the TIL.  The Consultant in collaboration with CFM and VHA will determine the organization/format of this document.  It is envisioned that the DG has generic information that will be applicable to all three CBOC types and also information that is relevant only to a particular CBOC type, which will be contained in one of the three Chapters.  The information in the DG shall include the following at minimum: 

Foreword and Acknowledgments:  Abbreviations shall show current VA abbreviation convention as used in recent DG updates.  Abbreviations shall contain VA standard definitions as well as those pertaining to OPC / CBOC services specifically.  Legends and Symbols shall comply with current National CAD Standards and mirror those in recent DG updates.  
The Foreword is written by CFM.

Narrative:  The narrative shall refer to the General, Functional, Technical, and Safety considerations for the spaces in these chapters for design of new CBOC projects. Functional Considerations relate to Space Planning and Operations.  Technical and Safety Considerations refer to Architectural, Structural, Equipment, MEP, Life Safety, Energy Conservation, Communications, Waste Management, etc.

Room Templates: Each graphic component: floor plan (FP), reflected ceiling plan (RCP), and interior elevations (IE) in this section shall be represented at an appropriate scale so that it can fit in an 8 Â½  x 11  page including title-block.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. This notice is for informational purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Vendors that believe they can provide the services listed above are invited to submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact. This procurement will be processed pursuant to FAR part 12 and Part 13.5. No solicitation will be issued.<br /><br />Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government. Responses are to be received within 10 days of this notice. No telephone calls are being accepted.<br /><br />The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Economic Research Service (ERS), intends to negotiate and award on a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) basis. A purchase order will be one base year (plus four option years) awarded to LMC International Ltd. of New York, NY for electronic access to the LMC Sugar Cost of production, LMC Sweetener Analysis, LMC Sugar &amp; Sweetener Quarterly, LMC Sugar Bulletin, and LMC Ethanol Market Service. Anticipated Date of the firm-fixed price Award is 4/1/2018.<br /><br />ERS is charged with analysis of factors underlying domestic and world supply, demand, and trade for sugar, alternative sweeteners, and ethanol. The LMC International Costs of Product ion database details estimates for 61 cane sugar producing countries, 35 beet sugar producing countries, and high fructose syrup producing countries. ERS analysts use the cost of production data to understand world sugar price trends and their effect on the U.S. sugar and sweetener market and consequent implications for U.S. Government sugar policy decisions. Many special research articles using these data have been published by ERS and are in work plans for additional research output.<br /><br />Detailed U.S. and Mexican regional cost estimates are included in the LMC International Cost-of-Production dataset.  Production cost data for all three sweeteners (cane, beet, and fructose syrup) are a core part of modeling supply adjustments in USDA's long-term sugar supply and demand projections model. The LMC data allows a disaggregated analysis and modeling of four U.S. cane sugar producing areas, six U.S. beet sugar producing areas and six sugar regions in Mexico. Modeling equations have been developed for all regions and allow the influence offering fertilizer, energy, and alternative crop prices to be included in the modeling.  The baseline model is the core tool for projecting the costs of the U.S. sugar program in the President's budget. Without the LMC Cost-of-Production data, baseline and scenario analysis would be seriously degraded.<br /><br />The LMC International Sugar and Sweeteners Market Report, Sugar Bulletin, and Sweeteners Analysis provide analysis and market commentary on North American and global sugar markets. LMC reports provide useful insight on market developments in sugar markets and a unique perspective on shorter-term price movements that are of interest to traders and commercial sweetener interests. This group is also a core readership for ERS products.<br /><br />The LMC International Ethanol Service provides data for Brazil that is hard to gather. All ethanol data and analyses are depended upon by a wide set of researchers and analysts in ERS's Market and Trade Economic Division (MTED). <br />

<DESC>The Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE), Personnel Airdrop Team, Natick, MA is conducting market research on candidate Enhanced Electronic Automatic Activation Device (EEAAD) systems. The EEAAD is a response to a need identified by the U.S. Army for an improved automatic activation device system that activates a parachutist's reserve parachute automatically in the event of a malfunction with the main canopy or with a disabled parachutist during airborne operations using ram-air parachute systems. The EEAAD is a safety device, intended for use by parachutists executing either High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) or High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) jumps, which activates a parachutist's reserve parachute automatically in the event the parachutist is unable to activate the reserve parachute at the intended altitude, or loss of altitude awareness. Currently teams and the Military Freefall School are using the Military CYPRES Automatic Activation Device; however, the Military CYPRES must be returned to the manufacturer to recover flight performance data in the case of an incident and for battery replacement.
<p>The EEAAD is required to record data after exit from the aircraft and activate the reserve canopy deployment sequence when activation criteria are met. The device will collect operational data to include the total number of operations, number of operations since the last download, exit altitudes, terminal speeds, changes in speed, opening shock and parachute deployment altitude.. The EEAAD will allow flight and maintenance data to be read at the unit level by maintainers, using only Army fielded equipment, and will not be subject to premature or inadvertent activation from electromagnetic environmental effects.</p>
<p>PM SCIE invites potential Offerors to participate in an Industry Day (ID) which will be hosted at Natick Soldier Systems Center, Natick, MA on Tuesday, 10 April 2018 from 0900 to 1200 (Eastern) with 30 minute private breakout sessions available from 1300 to 1530 (Eastern). The Industry Day will consist of a requirement overview briefing with particular focus on performance requirements, configuration management and cyber-security requirements, a Question &amp; Answer session and individual breakout sessions, if desired and as time allows. Due to resource demands and time limitations, requests will be fulfilled on a first come, first serve basis.</p>
<p>Questions from interested vendors shall be submitted by 1400EST on Tuesday, 3 April 2018, to the PM SCIE POC below, to provide the Government adequate time to respond. Government responses will be provided at the Industry Day. Registration for this event can be accomplished via the "Register for Industry Day" button. <br />Register for Industry Day button<br />PM SCIE Point of Contact:<br />Tash Salam / Email: tashfiq.salam.civ@mail.mil</p>

<DESC>U.S. Army Contracting Command intends to award a sole source contract to USA Hoist Company, Inc., 820 N. Wolcott Ave, Chicago, IL 60622 for repair of building 44 hoist system at Picatinny Arsenal. USA Hoist is a Veteran Owned Small Business.<br />The Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center's (ARDEC) requirement is repair of the Precision Armaments Laboratory (PAL) hoists. The ARDEC PAL facility, located at the building 44 complex, is a unique operational test and evaluation facility. The hoist systems are currently inoperable due to multiple complex part failures requiring major repairs and/or replacements caused by inclement weather conditions over the past several years. The hoists are used for weapon and ammunition projects at ARDEC for altitudes and range testing. The proposed contract action will include upgrading the hoist systems' electronics, software, firmware and carriage utilizing the most up-to-date parts and equipment while addressing current weatherization issues. The original manufacturer of the hoists are currently in control of the drawings, therefore competition is not possible. <br />A Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.302-1) was approved 2 February 2018. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.<br />

<DESC>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Air and Marine Operations (AMO) is initiating a modification effort to design, develop, integrate and operationally test a set of upgrade requirements for a prototype Bombardier DHC-8 Q200 and Q300 aircraft to form a basis for future DHC-8 fleet production conversions. The aircraft utilized for this effort are currently in operational service with a predecessor Mission Management System (MMS) and associated sensors.
<p>A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) Joint Operational Requirements Document (J-ORD) was developed by the DHS Joint Requirements Council's (JRC's) Aviation Commonality Portfolio Team, in collaboration with operational sponsors from CBP and the United States Coast Guard (USCG).  The J-ORD serves as a baseline for future USCG and CBP MPA acquisitions and upgrades in order to promote aviation system interworking and commonality.  The J-ORD specifies performance and operational parameters for MPA's.</p>
<p>AMO maintains a fleet of seven Bombardier DHC-8 aircraft, four Q200 and three Q300 series, that were purchased and modified into MPA aircraft from 2004 through 2010.  MPAs are multi-mission, fixed-wing aircraft that support traditional and emerging missions that are national priorities for Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense, and interagency partners. Sensor-equipped MPA's are the most effective means to support extended border maritime detection and monitoring to protect the United States from terrorism, illegal immigration, drug smuggling, and combating international criminal syndicates. To maintain the required capability and extend its operational reach throughout the maritime area of responsibility, AMO must modernize the DHC-8 in order to maintain a capable and cost-effective medium range aircraft capability.</p>
<p>Multiple components on AMO's DHC-8 aircraft are at end of life or no longer sustainable requiring their replacement. The requirements address the Mission Management System, operator control stations, mission management computers (hardware and software), tactical communications equipment, aircraft-specific sensors, interfaces with aircraft navigation and communications equipment and reliability/maintainability.</p>
<p>The DHC-8 Modification requirement will be released through the Consortium for Command, Control, and Communications in Cyberspace (C5) utilizing Other Transaction Authority (OTA) as the framework to promote increased industry engagement with Government. Details regarding C5 membership requirements may be obtained from C5 at https://cmgcorp.org/c5/membership/.  Detailed requirements will be released with the Request for White Papers (RWP) through C5 soon after this notice.  White Paper responses are restricted to C5 Consortium members.</p>
<p>In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2371b(f), and upon a determination that the prototype project for this transaction has been successfully completed, the competitively awarded prototype OTA project may result in the award of a follow-on production contract or transaction without the use of competitive procedures. The Government expects to award a follow-on production contract to convert the remaining fleet of five DHC-8 aircraft at or below the cost of the prototype upgrades developed under the C5 Agreement.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposals or Request for Quote, but for planning purposes only. A contract award will not be made from this announcement. The purpose of this announcement is to provide members of industry advanced notification of Government intent to issue a Request for White Papers through C5.</p>

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition
Upgrade Mechanical Door / Locking Hardware and Fire Alarm

Acquisition Plan Action ID: VA261-18-AP-0585 

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 21, Network Contracting Office 21, as requested by the Central California Health Care System (CCHCS), will enter into a new contract that requires justification for other than full and open competition.  Funds in the amount of $286,471.00 have been secured for the estimated cost of this requirement.  The purchase request (2237) number is 570-18-1-775-0001.

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This request is for a new firm-fixed price contract to be awarded to Stanley Convergent Security Solutions, Inc. This contract will provide upgrades to the existing door mechanical locking hardware and fire alarm relay connection with associated conduit for the fire drops at the VA Central California Health Care System (CCHCS) facility in Fresno.  

Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:  The VA CCHCS currently has a contract in place through the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to furnish and install a Physical Access Control System (PACS).  The new PACS system is required to maintain compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD 12): Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors.  The common identification for the VA has been established making the physical security and access systems in the facility redundant, hence the contract to install a new PACS.  During the initial work on the PACS install, it was determined that several door locks and other hardware at the facility are incompatible with the new PACS system and require replacement.  It was determined that the fire alarm system would also need to be corrected/upgraded.  The PACS system is designed to keep doors locked without proper identification.  That security measure must be removed in the event of a fire.  The current alarm system is not compatible with the new PACS and needs to be replaced.  The PACS system is being installed by Stanley Security, and it is a proprietary system.  The upgrades to the door locks/hardware and fire system must be compatible with the proprietary PACS system, therefore they must be furnished and installed by Stanley Security.

Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  This service is being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) per:
 (X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 (  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
 (  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
         or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
 (  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;


Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The requirements of this procurement are to furnish and install door locks/hardware and fire alarm system that must integrate with a proprietary access control system.  Stanley Security is installing the access control system and is the only company that can furnish and install all the required equipment to ensure the new access control system works. 
Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Research was conducted to identify options for the door lock/hardware replacements that would meet the needs of the Government.  Functionality of a variety of manufactures were reviewed concluding that only Stanley had the proprietary knowledge to be fully interoperable with PACS and other operating systems already in place.
Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The contracting Officer will not require Certified Cost or Pricing Data per FAR 15.403(c)(3) for this requirement.  The items are commercial item and the contract will be negotiated using the Government estimate.  The Government estimate will be based on market pricing.
Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was completed to the extent of determining the brands of door locks/hardware that are compatible with the proprietary access system being installed.  Only Stanley Security is able to furnish and install the components necessary for the facility to maintain security and safety.
Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  The $2 million-dollar contract to install the new access control system is in work but cannot be complete or fully operational until this contract is awarded.  The system is proprietary, requiring this work be accomplished by a contractor that can integrate with the new system.  
Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  No other entity has expressed an interest in this procurement.
A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The barrier to competition for this procurement is the failure to determine if the requirements for the new access control system are met prior to awarding the contract to install it.   
Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1

(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))

IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  

PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER: 580-18-2-167-0057
 1A.  PROJECT/TASK NUMBER    None 
 1B.  ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 24,598.00

These items are intended for use by the Anesthesiology Care Line Regional Anesthesia Team to perform cryotherapy nerve blocks for patients scheduled for knee replacement surgery.

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
The Iovera health system is the only nerve block device on the market capable of performing cryotherapy nerve blocks. There is only one supplier on the market for the IoveraÂ° health system handpiece* and accessories.  The supplier is ( Myoscience )

<p>Title: System Hosting and Updates for the Forecast of Opportunities, Operations, and Maintenance.</p>
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE &amp; REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government. This is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ) or Proposal (RFP). No solicitation documents exist, and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses received to this RFI. The Government will not pay for any response or demonstration expenses. Any information received will become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to collect information from industry on specific commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) products and services that can provide a forecast of small business opportunities maintained with current updated requirements for industry to access and review at any time.</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Public Law 100-656, the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988, amended the Small Business Act to emphasize acquisition planning. The law requires agencies to compile and publish projections of contracting opportunities that small businesses may be able to perform.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Forecast of Opportunities includes projections of all anticipated contract actions above $150,000 that small businesses may be able to perform under direct contracts with DHS, or through subcontract arrangements with the Department's large business prime contractors.</p>
<p>The Forecast of Opportunities is a COTS product and is accessible on any system platform, including smart phones, and works on Apple and Microsoft Windows computers. The site has two portals, one for government and one for industry, on the same web page, and is a software as a service (SaaS) hosted by the vendor. New DHS opportunities occur intermittently, which requires the Forecast of Opportunities to be available for updates as needed. The Forecast of Opportunities must be maintained and updated at all times for industry to access.</p>
<p>The high level requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain a current forecast in a system;<br />&bull; System generated removal of outdated requirements;<br />&bull; Ability for the government to update requirements when needed;<br />&bull; A web portal for industry to access on different types of platforms;<br />&bull; PIV Card access for government users;<br />&bull; Provide different user roles and responsibilities;<br />&bull; Routing documents in the system between roles;<br />&bull; Documents can be shared by multiple users;<br />&bull; Publishing and removing requirements on the forecast any time when needed;<br />&bull; Connect the requirement to the award; and<br />&bull; Provide reports to track requirements and maintain the forecast.</p>
<p>II. SCOPE</p>
<p>In order to successfully execute the Forecast of Opportunities requirement, the contractor shall provide and maintain a COTS system to facilitate the communication of future acquisition opportunities from DHS to industry.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>The intent of this contract is to provide equipment necessary for controlling European beachgrass and improving snowy plover nesting habitat at Baker Beach, Siltcoos Estuary, Dunes Overlook, Tahkenitch Creek Estuary and North and South Tenmile Creek on the Central Coast Ranger District - Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, Siuslaw National Forest.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, transportation, supplies (except those designated as Government-furnished), and incidentals to perform all work specified herein.
<p>Work will consist of maintaining existing nesting and overwash areas by scalping and burying beachgrass hummocks as well as lowering the height of previously untreated sections of foredune.

Time will be devoted to removal/cleanup of miscellaneous hummocks of European beachgrass from specified areas in the interior of nesting areas.  Much of the existing plover nesting area has been covered with oyster shell hash.  Care must be exercised by the contractor to minimally disturb these shell covered areas.  Overwash areas will be maintained as directed by the COR or the inspector.</p>
<p>Several large hills of sand will be leveled within the Baker Beach, Siltcoos, Overlook, Tahkenitch and North and South Tenmile snowy plover nesting area as directed by the COR or the inspector.  Excess sand will be dispersed within the nesting habitat area.  Large driftwood logs encountered will be buried or dispersed throughout the work site.  Driftwood logs may not be pushed into the ocean surf.</p>
<p>Material to be moved and to remain in place shall be as directed by the COR.  Project work will be restricted to Monday - Friday and exclude federal holidays.</p>
<p>The estimated start work date is November 1, 2018.  All work must be completed within 44 calendar days after effective date of the Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>This project is set aside 100% for small business concerns.</p>

ECMRA 
SUBPART 5237.1-SERVICE CONTRACTS GENERAL
5237.102 Policy 
(90) DoD contracting activities awarding or administering contracts shall incorporate the following Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA) standard language into all contracts which include services, provided the organization that is receiving or benefiting from the contracted service is a Department of Defense organization, including reimbursable appropriated funding sources from non-DoD executive agencies where the Defense Component requiring activity is the executive agent for the function performed.
 The reporting requirement does not apply to situations where a Defense Component is merely a contracting agent for another executive agency. The only contracted services excluded from reporting are construction and utilities. The standard language to be inserted is:

The contractor shall report ALL contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under this contract for the EOD 1 via a secure data collection site. The contractor is required to completely fill in all required data fields using the following web address https://www.ecmra.mil/Default.aspx.  

Reporting inputs will be for the labor executed during the period of performance during each Government fiscal year (FY), which runs October 1 through September 30.
 While inputs may be reported any time during the FY, all data shall be reported no later than October 31 of each calendar year. Contractors may direct questions to the help desk, linked at https://www.ecmra.mil/Default.aspx. 

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation: FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items 

The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible Offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and price related factors. The Government intends to award the contract to the eligible, lowest priced technically acceptable (LPTA), responsible offeror (see FAR 15.304).  Award will be made upon price reasonableness determination, contractor determination of responsibility within the meaning of FAR Part 9, and acceptance to the provisions set forth herein.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

I.	Technical (Do Not Include Pricing Info) â€“ The Technical Capability Volume will include Technical Approach  
II.	Past Performance
III.	Price

The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and (ii), the non-price factor.
Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) and (ii) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria.
Under this factor, the Government will rate the organization as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award.
Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements required by Factor (i) and (ii) will be further evaluated.
 For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i) and (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price. 

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. 

TECHNICAL APPROACH, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating the vendorâ€™s responses to the requirements. Please submit no more than a 5 page Word document, double spaced.    
The Governmentâ€™s performance work statement (PWS) is attached.  Ability to meet the PWS shall be demonstrated by the offerorâ€™s submission of a proposal that addresses how they will accomplish the objectives of the PWS.
  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.

VOLUME I
Technical Approach
The Quoterâ€™s Technical Capability, which represents the minimum technically acceptable criteria, is listed below: Under Factor I, Technical Approach, the Offeror shall provide:

 (i)	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY
a.	Technical approach of preventative maintenance section 4 of the PWS. Contractor must be an authorized maintenance provider of the UPS, MGE Galaxy 4000 and APC Symmetra PXâ€™s. Serial numbers: 1) QP10-000667   2) PD1432150159  3) ED0522001077  4) PD1607150035  5) PD1432150167
   
b.	Technical approach of corrective maintenance section 5 of the PWS.

c.	OFFERORâ€™S PROPOSAL SHALL DEMONSTRATE AN APPROACH THAT ENSURES THE BUILDING CRITICAL POWER GRID IS NOT JEOPARDIZED DURING PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES.
 

THE TECHNICAL APPROACH IS NOT TO BE A RESTATEMENT OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE PWS.

Technical The term â€œtechnical,â€ as used herein, refers to non-cost factors other than past performance. The purpose of the Technical Capability factor is to assess whether the Offerorâ€™s proposal will satisfy the Governmentâ€™s requirements. The Technical Evaluation Team shall evaluate the Offerorâ€™s proposal against these requirements to determine whether the proposal is acceptable or unacceptable, using the ratings and descriptions outlined in Table M-1.

TABLE M-1 	TECHNICAL RATING
Overall Rating 	Description
Acceptable	Proposal meets requirements of the solicitation.
Unacceptable	Proposal does not meet requirements of the solicitation.

VOLUME II: PAST PERFORMANCE

The Offeror shall list no more than three relevant contracts and/or subcontracts (not limited to Government contracts) within the last five years that demonstrate the ability to handle requirements of the same scope, magnitude and complexity to that which is detailed in the PWS.
 Relevancy shall be based on the type of tasks performed, and complexity. Include a discussion of how the references provided are relevant to the work being proposed. 

USE ATTACHED CORPORATE EXPERIENCE and PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION FORM

Past performance will be rated on an â€œAcceptableâ€ or â€œUnacceptableâ€ basis using the ratings in Table M-2.

TABLE M-2 PAST PERFORMANCE	RATING
Overall Rating	Definition
Acceptable	Based on the Offerorâ€™s performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the Offerorâ€™s performance record is unknown. (See note below including Neutral.)
Unacceptable	Based on the Offerorâ€™s performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.

NOTE: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)).
 Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown (or â€œneutralâ€) past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, a neutral rating shall be considered â€œacceptable.â€

VOLUME III: PRICE PROPOSAL

Offerors shall provide sufficiently detailed information to ensure a fair and reasonable determination of the proposed offer. Price will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b).

Offerors proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  A â€œwill complyâ€ statement without accompanying technical specifications of services being offered is automatic failure under this factor.
  Failure to meet the minimum criteria will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below.

Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) as delineated in Performance Work Statement will be further evaluated under Factor (ii). 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions to lowest price offer that is found acceptable in Factor (i) above.  However, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is determined to be necessary before contract award.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
   

(b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY.  Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating technical information submitted in response to this solicitation.  Offerors technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors technical information, will be evaluated and determined to be either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable. Criteria to use are conformance with ALL requirements delineated in the Statement of Work (SOW). Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may be eliminated from further competition. 

(c) PRICE. A Firm Fixed Price contract award will be made to offeror whose offer is determined to be the lowest priced technically acceptable offer.

This announcement will close at 5:00 pm PST on 26 January 2018.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA's National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory is currently utilizing Dell PowerEdge R730 servers as a core standard for VMWare-based (virtual machine) server clusters.  This hardware specification and common ESXi hosting approach dominate the data center IT assets in RTP, NC where the NHEERL Computational Cluster is to be housed. With operations overseen by OSIM, the ability to interchange Dell servers within the farm is critical to ORDÂ¿s overall virtual machine management requirements (e.g. allows for center-wide seamless integration).  To introduce another manufacturer base server model into the farm would be time consuming and cost prohibitive. OEI and ORD both also require Dell Open Manage software to remotely manage these systems. Dell Open Manage can only be used on Dell systems.  The GovernmentÂ¿s requirement for this specific hardware and virtualization software can only be fulfilled by authorized resellers of Dell hardware. The specified configuration is essential and no other manufacturerÂ¿s product can meet or be modified to meet this requirement.  Thus, the Dell server is the only server that can match the compatibility requirements needed.  The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.302-1 Sole Source, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required product or a similar product that meets the above described requirements should fully explain their product capabilities and qualifications in writing within 5 days from the date of this announcement.  The intent of this synopsis is to state the Government's intention to sole source this acquisition to Dell resellers only.  Therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing merely to submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  Offerors must submit all technical questions / responses concerning this synopsis electronically through FedConnect.

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br /><br />(ii) The solicitation number is 70T05018Q9NNFH001 and is issued as request for quotation (RFQ).<br /><br />(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-97.<br /><br />(iv) This acquisition is set-aside for small business concerns. The associated NAICS code is 611699 with a small business size standard of $11 million<br /><br />(v) Schedule:<br />CLIN-DESCRIPTION-QTY-UNIT OF ISSUE<br />00001 Base Period Firing Range Services (15 Apr 18 - 14 Apr 19) 360 Hours<br />10001 1st Option Period Firing Range Services (15 Apr 19 - 14 Apr 20) 360 Hours<br />20001 2nd Option Period Firing Range Services (15 Apr 20 - 14 Apr 21) 360 Hours<br />30001 3rd Option Period Firing Range Services (15 Apr 21 - 14 Apr 22) 360 Hours<br />40001 4th Option Period Firing Range Services (15 Apr 22 - 14 Apr 23) 360 Hours<br /><br />Note: The Period of Performance for each contract line item will be for a one-year period.

(vi) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired.<br /><br />(vi) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired - Firing Range Services. All services shall be performed in accordance with the Statement of Work.<br /><br />(vii) Services shall occur during the periods of performance. All services shall occur at the contractor's facility.<br /><br />(viii) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda to the provision.<br /><br />(ix) The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items is not applicable to the solicitation. The following evaluation procedures apply:
<p>Award will be made using a lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:<br /><br />1) Quotes may be removed from consideration for, but not limited to, the following reasons:<br />Quotes that are not received timely<br />Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1<br />Quotes that fail to submit any required documentation</p>
<p>2) Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.<br /><br />3) The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.<br /><br />If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue (in order by price) until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.<br /><br />4) USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.<br />(e) Each Factor will be evaluated as follows:<br /><br />Factor 1. Technical Acceptability<br />Technical Acceptability will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:<br />Acceptable - A quoter will be determined technically acceptable based on their capabilities to perform the requirements in accordance with the Statement of Work.<br />Unacceptable - A quoter will be determined technically unacceptable if their quote fails to demonstrate that they are capable of performing the requirements in accordance with the Statement of Work.<br /><br />Factor 2. Past Performance<br />Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:<br />Acceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br />Note: In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."<br />Note: Quoters are not required or requested to submit past performance references.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number 70Z03818QB2000127 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-97, effective 24 January 2018.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,250 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage Code F0210) and Airbus Group SAS (Cage Code F5442). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or an OEM authorized distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceable, genuine OEM parts, and is the only OEM authorized distributor for F0210 parts. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.</p>
<p>See attached documents titled: <br />&#61607; "Requirements - 70Z03818QB2000127" and<br />&#61607; "Terms and Conditions - 70Z03818QB2000127".</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Question: Please provide the distance from the back of each dryer to the outside exhaust vent. Please provide the number of turns in the vent system inside the walls or celling that run from the back of each dryer to the outside exhaust vent.</p>
<p>Answer: With respect to FSH washer/dryer locations, they are all located on the end the facilities adjacent to exterior<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>walls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contractor should be equipped to clean ducts and ducting systems without complication.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The dryer exhaust directly to the outside of the buildings from the floors where they are located.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
