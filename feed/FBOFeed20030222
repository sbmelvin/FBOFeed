<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with George Washington University for the services of technical assistance with developing a model to determine the effect of small geometry on the conductivity of copper lines. The goal for the project includes developing a set of test structures, which may be useful in characterizing advanced interconnect and builds upon modeling of advanced interconnect, which has been initiated at NIST.  The personnel of the University has extensive expertise within the areas of integrated circuit modeling, simulation, and advanced circuit design as applied to metrology test structures. The University has the required expertise in the Monte Carlo simulation of the behavior of electrons in advanced conductors, such as copper; and in design of line width metrology test structures, which are two areas that will be investigated.  The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about March 11, 2003.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the government will consider all capability statements received by March 11, 2003.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service, Hollings Marine Laboratory, U. S. Department of Commerce intends to procure an APT Triple Quadrapole Mass Spectrometer through the manufacturer Applied Biosystems.  This is a replacement for instrument of the same manufacturer of origin and an integral part of the analytical chemistry operations at the National Ocean Service.   The instrument provides the highest level of sensitivity required by the Marine Biotoxins Program for reliable detection and measurement of materials at sub-picogram levels, and for standardization of experimental protocols.  This replacement model is immediately compatible with existing liquid chromatograph front end (i.e. sample injection) systems, operating software, and data collection ana analysis systems.  Substitution of another mass spectrometer  from another manufacturer would halt ongoing work in this critical field of research and seriously compromise the entire biotoxins program as a direct consequence of the disruption.   The Government will accept similar products from another vendor, however, the products must be equivalent in form and function.  The following items must be supplied with this procurement: API 4000 Lc/MS/MS System -   Enhanced high performance triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a mass range of m/z 5 to 3000.  Turbo V Source, TurbolonSpray Probe, APCI Probe, Analyst Software, Windows NT software for control, acquisition and data processing.  21" Ultra Scan Color Monitor, National Instruments GPIB Communications Kit, DIGI Serial Port Expansion Card, Data Acquisition Workstation GS400 Optiplex, 1.4 GHz Pentium IV, 256/40. Line Transformers - required in areas where line voltage is out of specification.   Requited for installation.
