<CONTACT>Wallace O. Adcox, Contracting Officer, (703) 787-1354
<DESC>Gov.Works is issuing this request for proposals on behalf of the Office of Historical Trust Accounting, U.S. Department of the Interior. This  notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared  in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Subpart  12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; OFFERS ARE BEING  REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Contract period is  for a base period of two years with an option for an additional year. The  Government reserves the right to unilaterally extend the period of contract  performance in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, "Option to Extend the Term of  the Contract--Services." STATEMENT OF WORK: The Office of Historical Trust  Accounting, an office of the Secretary of the Interior, has a need for  long-term support, analysis, and expert advice and Departmental leadership  for the historical accounting on how a commercial trustee would operate and  provide information to common law trust beneficiaries. BACKGROUND: The  Department of the Interior (Department) has the fiduciary responsibility on  behalf of the U.S. Government to manage both Tribal trust funds and  Individual Indian Monies (IIM) trust funds.  These two trust funds and  accounts are managed by Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of the  Special Trustee for American Indians (OST). The Office of Historical Trust  Accounting (OHTA) was established on July 10, 2001, to plan for and direct  the historical accounting of IIM accounts.  The OHTA is developing a  Comprehensive Plan for the historical accounting which must be presented to  and approved by the Congress to secure long-term funding, and to the District  Court in relation to the "Cobell v. Norton" litigation (see below).  In  creating the OHTA, Interior Secretary Gale Norton set a first charge to  prepare an initial plan for what must be addressed in the Comprehensive Plan.   This initial plan submitted September 10, 2001, the "Blueprint for  Developing the Comprehensive Historical Accounting Plan for the Individual  Indian Money Accounts," is the framework for preparing the Comprehensive  Plan.  The Secretary's second charge was to develop a plan for initial work  that can begin before the Comprehensive Plan is completed.  The OHTA  submitted on November 7, 2001, the "Report Identifying Preliminary Work for  the Historical Accounting."  (Both documents are available on the OHTA  website at www.doi.gov/ohta/). The OST, established by the "American Indian  Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994" (PL. 103-412), was created to  improve the accountability and management of Indian funds held in trust by  the Federal Government.  Currently, OST maintains approximately 1,400  accounts for 315 Tribal entities with cash and investments of approximately  $2.8 billion, and more than 285,000 IIM accounts with cash and investments of  approximately $300 million. Annually, approximately $800 million passes  through the Tribal trust fund, and approximately $300 million passes through  the IIM trust fund.  This income is generated from the sale or rental of  Indian-owned land and natural resources such as timber, farming, grazing, and  royalties from various minerals and oil and natural gas exploration and  production, and from land use for rights-of-way and easements.  Funds also  are derived from interest earned on invested funds, as well as awards or  settlements of Tribal or individual Indian claims.  The BIA, along with the  Department's Minerals Management Service and the Bureau of Land Management,  manage the land records, and income collection and processing. COBELL V.  NORTON: The facts underlying the "Cobell v. Norton" litigation involve a  broad sweep of United States history.  Although U.S. policy through the 1870s  was to locate Indians on reservations, the government began to break up  reservations starting in the 1880s.  Thousands of individual Indians were  allotted 60-to 120-acre parcels of land in the breakup. The government held  these parcels in trust, and established an Individual Indian Monies Trust  Fund to collect and disburse to the Indians any revenues generated by mining,  oil and gas extraction, timber operations, grazing or similar activities on  their land. In June 1996, a class action lawsuit was filed against the  Department by five Indian plaintiffs on behalf of Individual Indian Money  (IIM) account holders which asked for, in part, the historical accounting of  IIM accounts.  The case was divided into two phases: the first phase  addressed the Department's efforts to reform the management of IIM trust  funds, and the timing and scope of any second phase relating to actual  accounting issues is not known at this time. Trial was held during June and  July 1999 on the first phase of the complaint.  In December 1999, the U.S.  District Court ruled that the Department was in breach of four specific  duties.  On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  affirmed the ruling of the District Court; however, it stated that the actual  legal breach was the failure to provide an accounting. It is within this  context that the Department will design its approach and conduct the  historical accounting using appropriate methods to fulfill its trust  responsibility. HISTORICAL ACCOUNTING PROJECT: As part of the Department's  overall trust reform efforts, the Department is undertaking an evaluation of  the reliability of past IIM account activity.  Part of this work is already  underway for the period after enactment of the "American Indian Trust Fund  Management Reform Act of 1994."  That work will not, however, discharge the  Department's duty to account as outlined by the two courts.  The mission of  OHTA is to determine what will be required to meet the Department's duty to  account, present the plan to Congress, and upon appropriation of funds  needed, implement the accounting. Given the length of time involved, the  distinct histories of various groups of trust assets, the various business  practices that generated trust income, known or suspected problems in the  records, and other historical factors, the development of a plan for the  historical accounting is expected to be a complicated task.  Among the things  that must be evaluated are the relative costs, utilities, and impact upon  beneficiaries of various approaches to providing the accounting for distinct  subgroups of accounts or trust assets. The plan for the accounting must be  both fair to beneficiaries and feasible. Based on information developed  through public meetings and from related efforts, including substantial work  in relation to production of records for the five named plaintiffs,  reconciliation of the five named plaintiffs' accounts, additional research  and progress toward the historical accounting, and related trust reform  efforts, the Department will develop a plan, as requested by Congress in the  fiscal year 2001 appropriations report language, describing in detail how the  Department will conduct the historical accounting, the methods to be  employed, the anticipated costs, and anticipated levels of confidence and  accuracy in the results.  In her Secretarial Order and memorandum of July 10,  2001, Secretary Gale Norton established the OHTA and charged the OHTA with  planning and carrying out this historical accounting. NATURE OF THE CONTRACT:  This contract is intended to provide the OHTA and the Department with  independent expertise and advice on the historical accounting from the  perspective of managing a large commercial trust operation.  Generally, the  contractor will be asked to review materials provided by the OHTA and provide  comments and suggestions on how the issue would be or has been addressed in  the commercial trust setting, pursuant to trust specifications and common law  trust responsibilities.  The contractor may be asked to review reports,  plans, alternative proposals, legal documents, accounting procedures,  historical accounting results, information to beneficiaries, or may be asked  to address specific issues and questions.  The contractor is expected to  offer its own independent analysis and comments strictly from the standpoint  of its own practice and experience as a commercial trustee.  As required, the  contract may be modified, curtailed, or extended, as needed by the OHTA. WHAT  WE NEED: The selected contractor will: 1) Have experience managing a large  commercial trust operation; 2) Possess knowledge of what constitutes an  accounting to beneficiaries by a trustee; 3) Possess knowledge of the  responsibilities and obligations of a commercial fiduciary/trustee across a  broad range of trust assets and management situations; 4) Examine and  evaluate records, documents, plans, accounting work, and other materials from  the standpoint of a commercial trustee; 5) Provide independent advice to the  OHTA and Departmental leadership on how a commercial trustee would carry out  its trust obligations in similar or related situations and on issues in the  historical accounting of IIM accounts; 6) Provide independent advice to the  OHTA and Departmental leadership on trustee-beneficiary relationships in a  commercial trust setting; 7) Suggest alternative approaches to a historical  accounting of the IIM trust accounts based on commercial trust management  experience. There are two principal parts to the historical accounting that  affect this contract.  The first part is a planning phase focused on  developing the Comprehensive Plan for the historical accounting.  The second  part is actually conducting the historical accounting.  Some aspects of the  historical accounting may, as part of the preliminary work and pilot  projects, be commenced prior to completion of the Comprehensive Plan.  The  contractor selected will be used to provide continuing trust management  advice and expertise regarding their trust management experience and  perspective. DURATION: While the duration of this contract is envisioned to  be approximately three years, the actual term will be determined by the  contractor's performance, need for the expertise, and available funding.  LOCATION: It is anticipated that the contractor will be available for  periodic meetings at its offices, at the Department of the Interior in  Washington, DC, or at sites around the United States. Meeting frequency is  expected to average about once a month. DIRECTION: The contractor(s) will  work with and be directed by the Deputy Director of OHTA, who will also be  the contract technical representative for Interior.  However, the contractor  may also receive tasks directly from senior OHTA and Departmental officials.   All tasking, reporting, and communicating procedures will be established at  the start of the contract. TASKS AND DELIVERABLES: Tasks and deliverables on  an ongoing basis will include but are not limited to those below.  Additional  tasks may be added by mutual agreement. 1) Review and analyze documents,  reports, options, issues, and questions submitted by the OHTA that relate to  the historical accounting of IIM accounts; 2) Provide independent, expert  analysis, advice, comments, and recommendations, as appropriate, based on the  contractor's experience of how it did or would address similar issues as a  commercial trustee; 3) Prepare written analyses, reports, or discussion  papers to address documents, issues, and questions submitted by OHTA.  The  contractor's analysis will include the basis for arriving at its conclusions  and recommendations; 4) Participate in discussions with key OHTA,  Departmental, and other contractor personnel on historical accounting,  beneficiary relations, and related decisions, policies, procedures, and  provide expert independent advice and recommendations as appropriate. HOW TO  PROPOSE: Offers must submit brief written proposals NOT EXCEEDING Fifteen  (15) pages in length. The proposal shall detail the methodology by which the  offer will meet our needs and demonstrate the relevant experience of the  company and its key personnel. Resumes must accompany the proposal but do not  count against the 15 page limit.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida, intends to conduct a limited competition between Bell Avon, Inc. of Picayune, MS and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies, Inc. of Fenwick, WV to award a firm fixed price contract to manufacture an LCAC Deep Skirt System.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has conducted a qualification program for manufacturers fabricating LCAC flexible skirt systems. These manufacturers were qualified in accordance with Government document No. 802-6336529, LANDING CRAFT, AIR CUSHION, PROJECT PECULIAR DOCUMENT, SKIRT MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS AND REQUIREMENTS DATED 01 APRIL, 1996, Revision C and document No. 802-6336530, LANDING CRAFT, AIR CUSHION, PROJECT PECULIAR DOCUMENT, SKIRT FABRICATION PROCEDURES dated 0 1 April, 1996, Revision B.  To date only Bell Avon, Inc. and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies have been certified as capable of providing the required LCAC flexible skirt systems.  As such these are the only two firms capable of competing for this requirement.  Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. NAICS 326299

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command has a requirement for engineering support services to develop Joint Services Specification Guides (JSSGs) and other systems engineering documentation, processes, risk assessments and safety-related analyses.
This is a notice of intent to request a proposal and negotiate with Sverdrup Technology, Inc. (SvT), 600 William Northern Blvd, PO Box 884, Tullahoma, TN 37388 on an other than full and open competitive basis.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SvT to provide continuity in the required ongoing engineering services.  SvT has conducted the initial and continuing work accomplished on the Tier I and Tier II Joint Services Specification Guides and other ongoing documents and processes.  Substantial duplication of costs would result in requiring a non-incumbent to assimilate the required learning for this task and perform in a timely manner. 
The proposed action will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and the estimated period of performance for the contract will be 12 months, with four 12-month options.  Contract award is anticipated to be 15 March 2002.  Government site workspace will not be available; all work will be accomplished at the contractor site.  
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, and no solicitation document is available.  
See Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases, Vaccine Research Center (VRC), intends to add an additional 150 non-human primates to the work currently being done by BioQual, Inc. under current contract N01-AO-12743.  The VRC has embarked on an ambitious research program to translate the latest concepts in disease pathogenesis and immunology into new vaccine strategies, thereby providing safe and effective means to prevent and control human diseases.  The urgency of this need requires an accelerated agenda particularly in early phase pre-clinical work.  Work will be done at the VRC to improve existing nonhuman primate AIDS models, by creating new challenge viruses for monkeys that more closely approximate the types of HIV isolates that are responsible for the transmission of HIV in people. New reagents will be developed for evaluating vaccine-elicited immune responses in monkeys so that studies can be done in a highly quantitative manner to assess and compare prototype vaccines. Studies will be pursued to define immune correlates of protection in monkeys against SHIV/HIV virus infections to provide guidance for vaccine strategies that could protect people against HIV infection. Finally, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of vaccine prototypes will be evaluated in non-human primates

BioQual is proposed as the only contractor with the requisite capability to support this agenda based on its experience providing the VRC similar services in the current, ongoing contract.  BioQual is already providing close support to the VRC through implementing multiple non-human primate animal protocols in animals housed and maintained at Bioqual.  There are currently 150 monkeys in place at BioQual that are being used for VRC protocols involving evaluation of immunogenicity and safety. The new environment created by recent bioterrorism events requires an advanced and accelerated approach to developing preventative and therapeutic vaccines based on validated animal models.  There is an urgent need to augment VRC testing capability with up to 150 additional monkeys, both for HIV protocols and for protocols involving other infectious diseases, in order to meet deadlines required under recent bioterrorism authorizations and schedules.  BioQual is fully briefed on current and planned animal protocols and would not require an additional training period or start up time frame to engage in fulfilling urgent VRC animal testing needs. Thus, there will be no learning curve for BioQual, a consideration that is deemed paramount.  In addition, the current contract was advertised and awarded competitively with only a single offeror responding.  That offeror was BioQual.   Thus, the government believes that no other offerors are currently available to adequately provide these services, and no offerors available who could fulfill implementation of VRC animal testing needs in non-human primates with no start up delay.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order to California Business Systems, 130 Produce Avenue, Suite B, South San Francisco, CA  94080, to dismantle, move, reconfigure, and reassemble a hi-density filing system.  The hi-density filing system was originally purchased from California Business Systems in 1997.  The office is moving locations and the system will not fit in the new location in its current configuration.  The reconfiguration will require the addition of new components that must match the original equipment.  This hi-density filing system is specialized equipment and it is highly unlikely that another contractor would have the necessary components and labor skills to dismantle it and reconfigure it (with additional components) to accommodate the new office space.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  This is not a competitive request for quotation and the Government does not intend to pay for information solicited or received.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of information received.  The Government will consider all information from responsible sources within 10 days after the publication of this synopsis.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.     The Technology:  Greater than 85% of routine human nuclear diagnostic procedures rely upon technetium because of its excellent radiation characteristics.  The reduction of pertechnetate becomes a critical step in exploitation of the full value of this element for diagnosis.  Presently, the inorganic compound tin chloride hydrate is the chemical reducing agent used commercially.  However, the complex chemistry of tin produces a number of byproducts which may be undesirable, limiting the development and application of test kits with reduced technetium compounds targeted for specific human organs.  The new technology presented here is a method, readily adaptable to an end user kit for the microbial reduction of technetium.  This microbial direct enzymatic reduction can form a range of products with potential value in targeting different tissues and organs.  Importantly, the method produces technetium for pharmaceutical purposes without the byproducts of the existing methodology.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Refurbishment of a NASA Langley Research Center-owned Milliken DBM-4 High Speed Camera to incorporate Electronic Data Management System. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from  Visual Instrumentation Coropration as the only known source who can meet agency requirements.  The original equipment manufacturer, Milliken, is out of business.  Visual Instrumentation Corporation has developed a process for upgrading Milliken cameras to include time code features.   The time code features are capable of creating accurate timelines of launches and accident events in support of the NASA Aviation Safety Program.  The upgrade of NASA's existing system versus purchase of a new system will result in substantial savings and avoid duplication of costs. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 1, 2002.

<DESC>On behalf of the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP), the Office of Naval Research (ONR) solicits research proposals meeting the goal and purpose of the Partnership Program outlined in Title II, subtitle E, of Public Law 104-201.

Up to $16M may be available for this solicitation, subject to appropriation and final approval by the National Ocean Research Leadership Council (NORLC). Team efforts among academia, industry, and government participants are required (at least 2 of the 3).  Cost sharing or proposals augmenting ongoing partnership efforts are very strongly encouraged.

Background: The central focus of the Partnership Program is an integrated and sustained ocean observation system achieved by a federation of many elements to support a wide range of users. The following five Topic Areas form the basis of the NOPP Investment Portfolio:

A) Operational/Routine Observations (including pilots, testbeds, etc.),
B) Research "Observatories" (long-term experiments and data series, etc.),
C) Observational Technique Development (sensors and platforms),
D) "Commons" for Ocean Information ("hubs" and "nodes", etc.),
E) Outreach/Education.

These investment areas are more fully described at www.nopp.org where examples of ongoing NOPP efforts are also listed by these areas. The NOPP website will contain the most recent information.  Not all NOPP solicitations will seek proposals in all areas. This announcement seeks only  proposals for new projects under Topics A and C and renewal proposals of existing NOPP projects under topic areas C and E.  

Topic A. Operational/Routine Observations

A (1) Economic Benefit-Cost Studies of Regional Coastal Ocean Observing Systems Partnership proposals are sought to conduct economic analyses to identify and quantify the expected economic benefits of sustained coastal ocean observing systems in each major US coastal region (including the Great Lakes).  Economic benefits should be identified, articulated, and quantified to the extent possible for each major user group to include: a) private sector activities such as energy development and transportation, commercial fishing, and commercial shipping; b) non-market activities such as coastal recreation, boating, and fishing; and c) public sector activities such as search and rescue and environmental protection, e.g. oil spill response.  The analysis should be capable of adding up benefits across the sectors to arrive at total systems benefits, which should then be compared with the estimated costs of the system in terms of standard benefit-cost analytic techniques such as net present values, internal rates of return, and cost/benefit ratios.

It is assumed that primarily extant information on user groups, sectors, and costs will be used for these studies, given the time and cost constraints.  New information (e.g.,  surveys) is constructive, but will likely be at a minimum. 

A major objective of this topic area is to produce initial estimates of economic benefits and costs that are comparable across regions and sectors using generally accepted tools of economic analysis.  For this reason, it is anticipated that NOAA??s Chief Economist, who has organized similar studies, will provide coordination and oversight for the individual regional studies.

NOPP envisions support for up to 8 individual economic studies not to exceed a total of $400,000 over two years; total funding for each selected project will be approximately $50,000.

A (2) Surface Vector Winds (SVW)
There is a maturing research capability to observe and utilize satellite-derived SVW over the oceans using various algorithms and models.  NOPP would like to demonstrate potential benefits of having comparable capabilities within the operational ocean and marine weather forecasting communities to improve existing or generate new products.  The goal is to help the operational community get ready to use SVW data and products from missions such as QuikSCAT, Wind Sat, SeaWinds/ADEOS-II, ASCAT/METOP, and CMIS/NPOESS.  This is to be accomplished via substantive partnering between the research and operational communities, helping ensure that the operational community is aware of the capabilities and limitations of, and has the tools to use, various SVW data and products.  The specific objective is to demonstrate the utility of satellite-derived SVW in an operational setting, providing quantitative measures of their impact wherever possible.

A (3) Sea Surface Temperature (SST)   
While operational satellite-derived SST products have been produced for over two decades, there have been advances in research capabilities to observe and utilize satellite-derived and in-situ SST.  It is now time to design and demonstrate a prototype system to produce on an operational basis both in-situ skin and bulk SST products, for use in conjunction with missions such as AVHRR/POES, TMI/TRMM, AMSR/AQUA and ADEOS-II, and VIIRS/CMIS/NPOESS.  The demonstration should collect both skin and bulk SSTs from a limited number of volunteer observing ships, where personnel are available to check instruments while the ships span a broad range of latitudes.  With NPOESS requiring skin and bulk SST data and products, a successful demonstration of the prototype system will enable improvements in the calibration of satellite-derived observations of skin SST, and especially in the estimation of heat flux across the sea surface.  This demonstration is to be accomplished via substantive partnering between the research and operational communities, helping ensure that the operational community is aware of the capabilities and limitations of, and has the tools to use, various potential improvements to SST data and products.  If successfully demonstrated, this prototype system could then be implemented globally on a routine and continuing basis. 

Topic A2 and A3 Summary: While some efforts have begun to explore new and improved operational products, NOPP wishes to accelerate development and operational demonstration of data products and operational services using these data sources.  Successful proposals must have substantive partnerships involving both research and operational entities.  Each project should address the development of new self-consistent data and products and show why they represent improvements to the status quo.  

In Topics A2 and A3, approximately $3.0M will be available over three years to support two selected projects; each project will be in the range of $500K per year for three years.  

Topic B. Research "Observatories"

No  proposals are being solicited in this area at this time.


Topic C. Observational Technique Development 
Partnership efforts are sought here to develop and/or demonstrate new ocean observational capabilities to establish the means for continuous, high-resolution measurements of oceanic processes. For this solicitation the emphasis is on further biological and chemical sensor developments for autonomous and unattended moving and fixed observational platforms (e.g., drifters, floats, gliders, AUVs and moorings).

NOPP wishes to continue the technical development of biological and chemical sensors started in the FY99 BAA and their integration on a variety of autonomous devices and observing instruments for long-term (weeks to months) deployments, so that the scientific and operational data returned from the developing ocean observing network can be continuously improved. 

Collaborative proposals are sought for development and application of new sampling, analytical, and interpretive techniques to improve the characterization of distributions, mechanisms, and rates of processes involving chemical and biological variables together with physical variables in the ocean. The challenge is to develop rapid analytical techniques and "smart" sampling tools based on real-time measurements. Fundamental progress will require coordinated efforts involving:
?h improvements in sampling and measurement strategies on process-relevant time and space scales, 
?h implementation and/or development of new analytical methodologies, and 
?h processing/storage/transmittal that closely link observations to models, sufficiently to develop a predictive capability. 
Such efforts should embrace networking and broad accessibility to all derived data in near or real time.

Autonomous and/or long-term and/or distributed approaches that provide new observational capabilities for the ocean community are particularly encouraged.

The emphasis should be placed on one or more of the following:
?h novel approaches and concepts for measuring a specific biological and/or chemical parameter coherently in 4-D; 
?h unattended observations which can be extended over time periods from various platforms (e.g., for independent operation Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV's), drifters, gliders, and floats) or on moored platforms, all with real-time telemetry; 
?h providing a significant reduction in instrument power requirements, weight and volume without reducing fidelity or resolution as compared to current state-of-the-art devices; and
?h developing the next generation of low cost biological and/or chemical instrumentation for use by the ocean research community. 

Proposals should clearly specify: 
?h what capabilities the new technology will provide; 
?h how it improves upon existing technology and sampling methodology; 
?h why it is important and relevant to the needs of the oceanographic community; and 
?h the current status of the technology (whether a prototype has been tested or when one will become available to users as a result of funding provided by NOPP).

New proposals may request up to five years of support for instrument development, testing and validation.  Renewal of previous NOPP awards in this topic may request up to two additional years for continued testing and validation.   

Approximately $10M is available to support 2 to 5 new projects in the range of $500K to $1M per year for up to 5 years. 

Topic D. "Commons" for Ocean Information

No proposals are being solicited for this topic at this time.  However, a special solicitation for this topic may be issued later this year.

 Topic E.  Outreach/Education
Only renewal proposals are being solicited (see below).  No new project proposals are being solicited under this topic area at this time. 

Renewals.  Topics C and E
Currently funded NOPP partnership efforts under Topic C can seek additional funding for 2-5 renewal projects in the range of $200K to $400K per year each for up to 2 years. 

Currently funded NOPP partnership efforts under Topic E can seek additional funding for one year to "wrap-up" existing efforts and/or to begin transition to other efforts, where appropriate. Funding up to $100,000 per year each will be available for 1 year for these purposes.

Review of these efforts will follow the guidelines outlined below, with the additional criterion of accomplishments achieved to date. Proposals must clearly state on their cover sheet that this proposal is a Renewal. 

General Instructions and Information
Separate proposals must be submitted for each topic or subtopic area.   It is anticipated that all awards to non-governmental participants resulting from this announcement will be grants.  Any NORLC member may fund research in response to this solicitatioin.

<DESC>The Fishery Resource Analysis and Monitoring Division of the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), requires the charter of a commercial trawler to conduct a bottom trawl survey this summer of the slope zone (100 to 700 fathoms) off the West Coast of the United States. The vessel will be under charter for approximately five weeks during which time it will conduct an independent survey of the slope zone from Cape Flattery, Washington to Morro Bay, California. The charter will begin in Newport, Oregon, and end in Morro Bay, unless other ports are selected by mutual agreement. Under the direction of a NMFS-designated chief scientist, the vessel will fish in a systematic manner with bottom trawl gear according to a pre-specified survey design and a manual governing the construction, rigging, and operation of the trawl gear used for sampling. The trawl gear to be used during the charter will be supplied by NMFS, as will a portable trawl instrumentation system that will be used to monitor and measure various aspects of the trawl's performance during sampling hauls. The vessel will serve along with other trawlers already under contract either during the first survey period beginning on or about June 25, 2002 or during the second survey period, which will begin approximately three weeks after the end of the first and will also run for approximately five weeks. In general, typical coastal trawlers are required, however, vessels must be at least 60 feet long and have a minimum horsepower rating of 400. The vessel must be prepared to fish effectively at depths up to 700 fm and accordingly must have at least 1200 fm of warp installed on the trawl winches. There must be berthing accommodations for three project scientists (which may include women) as well as a crew comprising at least two fishermen and a captain. The vessel must be prepared to operate for at least nine days between port calls. This will be a "Fish for Research" charter. That is, a mixture of cash and additional fishing opportunities over and above current limited-entry groundfish trip limits will be used to compensate the vessels chartered for this survey. The Government intends to pay cash for 50% of the value of the charter services. Any balance still owed to the vessels will be compensated by revenue from sales of fish caught during survey operations and by means of exempted fishing permits issued to the vessels allowing them, during regular commercial trips after the conclusion of the charter, to land fish in excess of their trip limits up to the value of the amount owed. A Request for Proposals providing detailed technical and performance specifications and proposal instructions will be issued on or about March 7, 2002. The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this procurement is 487210 and the size standard is $5.0 million. See Numbered Note 1.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Basis for Award:  
The Government will evaluate each offeror?s proposal on the basis of the criteria listed below.  The Government will award a contract on the basis of price, proposal risk, past performance and technical mission capability to that responsible offeror submitting the offer considered most advantageous to the Government.
-The Government may award a contract based on initial offers received, without discussions with the Offerors.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration intends to award a single source contract in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4.1.2 to Innovative Solutions International, Inc. (ISI) for the implementation of a GPS User and Advisory Database (GUARD) on the U. S. Coast Guard Navigation Center (USCG NavCen) website.  This service will attempt to identify all users (civil and military) of GPS. <P> The period of performance for the planned ISI contract is approximately March 2002 through September 2002.  The estimated price for the proposed contract is $244,000.00.  It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to acquire these services from ISI on a single source basis for the following reasons: <P> ·  In June 2001, the Interagency GPS Executive Board (IGEB) authorized the expenditure of their stewardship funds to have a contractor gather GPS civil user information notification requirements, perform an analysis of the alternatives to select a host organization to implement and maintain the database and web site. The contractor selected to perform these tasks was ISI. <P> ·  ISI has already designed and developed the requirements for the database and website; which was approved by the Government.  ISI will now implement the GPS User and Advisory Database using the requirements and recommendations from the  “Joint GPS Information Requirements and Analysis Plan” previously drafted by ISI and approved by the Government.  ISI has the requisite knowledge, qualified staff, and experience to complete this proposed effort within the estimated price and period of performance. <P> All materials with appropriate restrictive legends received by the FAA will be treated as Proprietary Information.  Interested parties are requested to submit responses via federal express to this announcement totaling no more than 12 pages, by 3:00 PM EST, 4 March 2002, to: <P> 	Federal Aviation Administration 	ATTN: Susan D.

<DESC>NA The US Army CECOM Acquisition Center - Washington intends to award a sole source purchase order with PEI Electronics, Inc., at 110 Wynn Drive, Huntsville, Alabama 35805-0929 for delivery of M1A1 Thermal Imaging System (TIS) Video Reformatters. The Night Vi sion & Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) has undertaken the task of upgrading and modernizing existing M1A1 and M2A2 training ranges for the 7th ATC at Grofenwoehr, Germany. The core of this effort encompassed the development of a Range Evaluation Sys tem (RES) that greatly enhanced the previous training capabilities at these three ranges.  The purpose of the Range Evaluation System is to provide a 'real time' view of tank crew operations and to provide an After Action Review (AAR) video capability for tank crewmembers while undergoing training exercises at Grafenwoehr Training Area (GTA), Germany.  The basic components of the RES are the Vehicle RF System and a Tower FLIR system.  The Tower FLIR camera system provides an 'overwatch' view of the tank fir ing range during training exercises.  The Vehicle RF System consists of two video crew cameras that collect imagery of tank crewmembers during firing exercises and a TIS Video Reformatter that reformats the TIS video into a format useable by the VRFS syste m.  The three video streams are then inserted into a 'quad' splitter and transmitted back to the range tower for further processing.  The video from tower FLIR camera is then inserted into this quad image.  This RES video is then displayed in real time to the unit commanders and recorded by the Tank Crew Evaluators (TCE) for use in the After Action Review process. The PEI Video Reformatter system is basically 'transparent' to the crew and allows the RES VRFS system to obtain, transmit and record the exact t hermal targeting information as seen by the crew. 'Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements'. However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provi de need support may submit a quote that shall be considered by the Agency. The resultant contract will be performed under an anticipated fixed price order. Award will be made IAW Simplified Acquisition Procedures. . Response should be no longer than three (3) pages. Responses are to be received via email within 20 calendar days from the date of this notice. All request for further information must be in writing and via email, telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. You may forward  responses to be following e-mail address: Naomi.Lee@CACW.Army.Mil.  See note 22.

<ARCHDATE>05152002
<CONTACT>Courtney Jones, 503-808-4630
<DESC>NA The Portland District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a construction contract for the construction of  a Corner Collector Surface Flow Bypass System at the Bonneville Dam Second Powerhouse which will assist in the migration of juvenile salmon ids.  The system utilizes the existing powerhouse Ice and Trash Chute located on the south end of the powerhouse as the system intake.  The existing operating gate will be removed and a new steel gate approximately 15 ft x 30 ft will be fabricated and inst alled.  Approximately 300 feet of the existing Ice and Trash Chute will be modified for use as the beginning of the transportation channel and another 2700 feet of 15 ft x 20 ft box-shaped concrete conduit will be constructed on the Cascade Island north sh oreline, adding to the chute to extend the outfall point downstream.  Approximately 500 feet of mass concrete monolith shall be constructed at the downstream end of Cascade Island to support the transportation channel and form the outfall structure.  At th e outfall site, approximately 30,000 cubic yards of river material will be excavated and scour protection placed to form a plunge pool. Due to the extremely sensitive needs for biological and hydraulic reasons, the new fish bypass system requires concrete quality as a critical variable.  This quality must be adhered to with regard to forming, finish, placement, tolerances, surface treatment, and repair.  Significant underwater work activities, including pile driving, excavation, concrete placement, and scou r protection are also very critical and highly sensitive factors in particular to this specific job.  Due to these critical sensitivities for construction, the Government will use Best Value Procurement for the evaluation and award of this contract.  This procurement is open to both large and small businesses.  The size standard for small business concerns including all affiliates, with average annual sales or receipts for the last three years not in excess of $28,500,000.00.  All interested responsible fir ms are invited to request a copy of the subject Invitation for Bids (IFB), in CD Rom format, at no charge by registering on our website at https://www.nwp.usace.army.mil.  The anticipated issue date for the IFB is April 15, 2002 with a tentative bid openin g date of May 30, 2002.  Performance will be July 2002 through December 2003.  In addition, in order to do business with the Department of Defense, the contractor must enroll on the Central Contractor Register (CCR).  Contractors may access the CCR website  at www.ccr.gov.  The technical point of contact is John Etzel at (503) 808-4953.

<SOLNBR>DE-AC24-02OHXXXXX
<CONTACT>Ralph Holland, Contracting Officer, 937-865-4161, RALPH.HOLLAND@OHIO.DOE.GOV;Ralph Holland, Contract Specialist, 937-865-4161, RALPH.HOLLAND@OHIO.DOE.GOV
<DESC>Notice of Intent:  Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements?, the Ohio Field Office intends to enter into negotiations on a sole source basis with West Valley Nuclear Services Company for the continued management and operation of the West Valley Demonstration Project.  The period of performance for the planned contract extension is 27 months, beginning October 1, 2002 and continuing through December 31, 2004.  The scope of the planned extension includes completion of the construction of a remote handled waste facility, decontamination of the most highly contaminated portions of the facility, safe lay-up of the high level radioactive waste storage tank farm and vitrification facilities, and development of a comprehensive project turnover package, including final documentation packages of high level waste canisters to permanent repository criteria. Furthermore, at the end of the 27-month performance period, the site will be configured to address one of the following three options: proceed with waste management activities (e.g., waste characterization and shipping), and decommissioning to Nuclear Regulatory Commission criteria specific to the West Valley site; waste management activities only; or safe ?lay-up? and minimal maintenance.  It is anticipated that the contemplated extension will serve to enhance the opportunity for competition for the follow-on contract for the period beyond December 31, 2004.  By leveraging WVNS? unique capabilities and completing the highest risk elements of the project, DOE will be strongly positioned with several options for the successor contract.  As a result, it will be possible to develop a work scope and solicitation package that will promote and provide for full and open competition to the widest extent. West Valley Nuclear Services Company, as operator of the West Valley Demonstration Project since its inception in 1981, possesses unique qualifications in the areas of vitrification facility design, construction, and operation, design and in-process construction of the remote handled waste facility essential to its decontamination, detailed knowledge of the extent and nature of site contamination, activities necessary to conduct expeditious facility decontamination, and necessary regulatory and community interfaces.  These qualifications are essential to the Department?s ability to fulfill its obligations under the project?s authorizing legislation, The West Valley Demonstration Project Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-368).  Additionally, pending the completion of the site Environmental Impact Statement and issuance of a Record of Decision, the conduct of a competitive acquisition for a 27 month period of performance is considered to be disruptive to such an extent as to jeopardize the project schedule and would result in significantly increased cost to the Department.  As a result it has been determined that only one responsible source is available and no other services will satisfy the needs of the Department.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE RECEIVING RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE OF A NON-COMPETITIVE ACTION.  IF PARTIES CHOOSE TO RESPOND, ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPONDENT AND WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  Interested parties believing they have all the capabilities described above may submit capability statements to be received within 30 days of publication of this notice.  Any such responses should be directed to: U.S. Department of Energy, Ohio Field Office, P.O. Box 3020, 1 Mound Road, Miamisburg OH 45343-3020, Attention: Ralph E. Holland. See Note 22.

<CONTACT>Mallorie Irwin, 601-631-7270
<DESC>NA USAE, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) proposes to issue a sole source contract to MTS Systems Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN, for the purchase of one (1) Data Acquisition System (DAC).  The system is required to interface with systems curren tly controlling wave generators for the ERDC, Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory (CHL.) The DAC system has multi-tasking, multi-station capabilities that will permit operation of two wave generators, one in a flume and one in a wave basin at the ERDC site, Vicksburg, MS.  The DAC will be located in an existing control room.  The DAC will have the capability of 64 A/D and 48 digital (i.e. parallel) I/O channels.  As a minimum, 48 of the 64 A/D channels will be dedicated to wave gages and 16 “other” channels r eserved for other sensors.  Each wave gage has two A/D channels associated with it, one for the wave rod and one for a Jordan controller, which is a servo controller used for automated calibration of the wave gages.  Each wave gage requires two digital I/O  channels to operate the servo motor.  The “other” channels have only one A/D channel associated with them.  All channels will use signal conditioning supplied by ERDC.  All A/D inputs should have BNC connectors and all A/D channels shall be capable of acc epting +/- 10 vpp input.  The digital I/O output connector shall be a miniature db-9.  The DAC capability will be shared by the facilities described in the first sentence.  The scan rate for data sampling for all gages on the system will be a minimum of 1 kHz.  All DAC parts should be interchangeable with the existing DAC systems at the ERDC to promote compatibility across the facilities and minimize down time.  This DAC must be compatible with the existing signal conditioning hardware that presently exists  in the control room.  It must interface with the mechanical and electrical, calibration, wave generation, and data analysis subsystems.  The DAC will have one PC that is capable of handling both data acquisition and control.  The PC should have the follow ing specifications as a minimum:  Windows NT operating system, 2.0 GHz CPU, 1 GB RAM, 21 inch flat screen monitor, 100 Gb hard drive, LS120 Floppy drive (if available) and a rewritable CD-ROM.  The software controlling the DAC system must interface to that  used on the ERDC Large Scale Sediment Transport Facility, Coastal Structure Modeling Basin, Hudson Building ADACS trailer and LA-LB control room.  The DAC software must allow automated calibration of the wave gages and control of the generators, as well a s control of the data acquisition.  It must contain all of the features of the existing data acquisition software such as multi-station multi-tasking capability, oscilloscope output, spectral output, and complete control over calibration of sensors and ope ration of the wave generators.  The DAC must be compatible and seamlessly integrated with the software for calibrating wave gages and other types of instruments.  The vendor shall provide all labor and materials required for DAC installation, integration, and checkout with the existing wave machines.  ERDC will specify a full suite of acceptance tests to confirm a fully functional system prior to acceptance of the new DAC.  Tests will include performance and endurance tests as well as electrical reliability  tests.  SCHEDULE:  Delivery is projected to be mid April 2002.  This DAC manufactured by MTS is the only known system that meets or exceeds the minimum selection criteria and the procurement of this system is critical to the Corps of Engineers’ Coastal an d Hydraulics Laboratory Research and Development Program.  A firm fixed-price contract will be awarded utilizing the Simplified Acquisition Procedures as defined in FAR Subpart 13.5.  Any other responsible source able to provide the supplies referenced abo ve is encouraged to respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) days after its publication.  This is not a request for quotations and thereis no solicitat ion document available at this time.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The work includes three (3) indefinite quantity contracts for miscellaneous design and engineering services for underwater facility assessments of Government waterfront facilities at various locations, worldwide.  The general intention is for the contractor to provide design and engineering services that will be described and procured through appropriate task orders for each contract.  The government intends to set aside two of the three contracts for Small Business.  One of the three contracts will be awarded on an unrestricted basis.
Underwater assessment includes, but is not limited to, underwater inspection; engineering analysis of existing conditions in comparison to design requirements, previous inspection reports and/or drawings of the facilities; engineering calculations for structural analysis with or without previous design calculations; documentation of findings; and recommendations with cost estimates for follow-on actions.  All underwater assessments will be performed under direct control and supervision of registered professional engineer-divers.  For each underwater assessment, one registered professional engineer-diver shall be appointed as the engineer-in-charge (EIC).  That EIC shall supervise the diving, dive at least 50% of the time, supervise the writing of the detailed inspection report, and write at least 50% of the detailed inspection reports.  The other engineers on-site may write the balance of the inspection report.  The EIC shall ensure that all diving is performed in accordance with OSHA standards.  US citizenship is required for access to inspection sites.
Additional products and services may include construction contract drawings and SPECSINTACT specifications; bid analyses; post construction award services (PCAS); Title II inspection services; engineering report review; database design, construction and population; procedures and guidelines reports; engineering calculations; static and dynamic structural and using computer modeling; three-dimensional structure modeling and rendering; seismic vulnerability assessments, including analysis of critical elements and development of retrofit schemes; water tank inspections in accordance with applicable standards of the American Waterworks Association and NAVFAC MO-210.9; and FHWA certified bridge inspections using NBIS standards for overland and over water bridges.   
A waterfront facility is defined as any structure located on the waterfront, in connection with, or potentially in contact with, water or the marine environment.  This would include inland structures that require underwater investigations.  Waterfront facilities include, but are not limited to, piers, wharves, bulkheads, quaywalls, offshore towers, potable water storage tanks, dams, water control structures; instrument support structures, dry docks, moorings, bridges, underwater cables, or any similar structure.
The duration of the contracts will be for a period of one base year, with the possibility of two option years.  The guaranteed minimum amount under each contract shall be $20,000 for the base year only.  The estimated total amount contracted for each contract shall not exceed $2,500,000 per year.    The selected firms for these contracts will be required to provide a fee proposal within ten days after receiving the Request for Proposal for each task order.  Each task order will be fixed price. 

SF 254 and SF 255 provided for consideration should not exceed 20 pages total.  Proposals shall be submitted electronically to collinssj@nfesc.navy.mil or palmorerd@nfesc.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of the submitter to ensure that proposals were received at the above sites.  Submittals are due no later than 2:30 P.M. EST, March 26, 2002.
 
Firms that wish to be considered for this project will be evaluated upon the following criteria.  Criteria numbers one and two are of equal importance and the other criteria are shown in descending order of importance after criteria one and two.
 
1.      Professional qualifications and technical competence of the team proposed for this project in the type of work required.  Professional qualifications include professional registrations of the design personnel assigned to the project.  Qualifications for all diving personnel include the ability to meet OSHA safety standards and dive industry standards.  As well as professional qualifications for design personnel, diving team members will be evaluated upon certifications earned that are generally accepted certifications for the diving industry.
 
2.      Specialized experience in the type of work required.  This criteria includes experience in the following areas:  a.  Design and engineering services for repairs of waterfront structures using destructive and non-destructive (NDT) techniques.  b.  Static and dynamic structural analyses, including seismic vulnerability assessments and vessel/structure interaction analyses of waterfront facilities using computer tools.  Evaluation of both impressed current and sacrificial anode type cathodic protection systems on submerged structures.  c.  Experience with and capability to provide engineering submittals in electronic format(s).  (Submittals will include, but are not limited to:  contract bid documents, web-enabled multimedia inspection reports, three dimensional models and renderings.)
 
3.      Capacity of the firm to perform the work in the required time period.  Capacity includes the firm?s ability to perform multiple tasks concurrently in the required timeframe.  Condition assessment reports will be required with 60 to 120 days after completion of the field inspection, depending upon the number and size of the facilities inspected.
 
4.      Quality control and safety assurance procedures for underwater inspections, report preparation, structural assessments and design services.  A copy of firms? safe diving practices manuals, or diving operations manuals is required for review (the manual will not be returned.)
 
5.      Past performance on projects of similar size and scope.
 
In addition to the above criteria, the following considerations will be used in the case that firms are found to be equally qualified.  It is the intent of the Department of Navy to award these contracts to firms that are the most highly technically qualified and these considerations will only be used in the case of equally technically qualified firms.
a.  Volume of work awarded by the Department of Defense (DOD) within the past 12 month with the idea of sharing the wealth of DoD contract dollars among highly qualified firms.
               b.  Superior performance on past contracts.  This may be demonstrated by providing copies o design awards, excellent performance evaluations, letters of recognition, etc.
c.  Commitments that firms are willing to make to small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, etc., in subcontracting possibilities.

<DESC>NA Project consists of construction of flood control features in the Bechara Industrial Area (BIA) of San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The work is part of the Rio Puerto Nuevo Project.  The solicitation includes a base and two options.  The BASE WORK includes construc tion of a levee, rectangular channel, trapezoidal earth channel, and box culvert.  The Margarita levee consists of approximately 3,600 linear feet of trapezoidal earth filled levee, with the levee crest at Elevation +13.0 feet NGVD.  The Margarita levee is  in a low, vegetated, marshy area north of the De Diego Expressway (PR 2) and Quebrada Margarita, and runs along the southern edge of the BIA.  Construction of a portion of the levee is along an existing overgrown construction berm built between high-volta ge electrical transmission lines.  At the upstream end of the project, the existing Bechara Channel, along the northeast edge of the BIA, will be improved with a rectangular channel 55 feet wide with an invert of –3.62 feet NGVD, for a length of approximat ely 950 feet.  The walls will be constructed of concrete lined steel sheet pile.  Others will replace the existing Kennedy Avenue Bridge and the culverts under the Marginal Road with new single-span bridges having a rectangular channel beneath that matches  the dimensions of the new upstream rectangular channel.  Downstream of the bridges, an open trapezoidal earth channel will be excavated.  The trapezoidal channel will have a bottom width of 25 feet with the invert at Elevation –10.0 feet NGVD.  The earth channel will be approximately 400 feet long, ending on the south boundary of the Puerto Rico Port Authority’s Puerto Nuevo Terminal.  From the earth channel, storm water will be conveyed to San Juan Harbor through a 2,150-foot long reinforced concrete doub le-box culvert.  The concrete box culvert will be constructed within a dewatered cofferdam consisting of steel sheet piling.  Between the trapezoidal earth channel and the box culvert, the channel transitions into a 200-foot long, 180-foot wide rectangular  channel to allow flow under an existing 90-inch diameter sanitary effluent outfall main.  Modifications to strengthen the sanitary effluent outfall main are included in the work.  The contractor may use excess suitable material from the culvert excavation  for levee construction.  All unsuitable material and excess suitable material will be disposed of offsite at an approved location obtained by the Contractor.  Work also includes traffic control, pavement repairs, secondary drainage, and utility relocation s.  OPTION 1 WORK includes construction of approximately 1,080 linear feet of the Margarita levee at its western end.  OPTION 2 WORK includes construction of 200 feet of the concrete box culvert at San Juan Harbor, associated demolition of the existing wha rf, and reconstruction of the pier.  Option work also includes approximately 400 linear feet of the Margarita Levee at it eastern end.  The estimated construction time for the BASE work is 900 calendar days; Option 1 Work, 180 calendar days and Option 2 Wo rk, 180 calendar days.  PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  A trade-off process that combines non-priced and priced factors will determine best value.  All evaluation factors  other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price.  The following factors will be used to determine best value: Price, Past Performance, and Technical Merit.  Magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.  Solicitation  will be issued on or about 12 March 2002 and close on or about 26 April 2002.  Solicitation will be issued in electronic format only.  Offerors will be provided a CD-ROM at no cost.  Interested offerors must register electronically.  The registration form  is located at http://ebs1/ebs/AdvertisedSolicitations.asp.  THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED ACQUISITION.  You must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration  in order to be eligible to receive an award from this solicitation. Call 1-888-227-2423 for more information.  NAICS Code 234990, size standard $27.5 million.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Systems Support Division (AFRL/MLSC and AFRL/MLSA), Wright-Patterson AFB, OH intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) F33615-02-R-5607 in April 2002.  The title of the RFP is "Quick Reaction Evaluation of Materials and Processes".  The award will be a follow-on contract to F33615-94-C-5601 also titled "Quick Reaction Evaluation of Materials and Processes".  The award will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with an estimated value of $18.5 million over eight (8) years.  The period of performance for the entire effort is 101 months; 96 months of technical effort, and five (5) months for the final reports.  Technical, financial, and semi-annual progress reports will be required.  This program will be conducted primarily on-site at AFRL/MLS, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH in order to reduce cost and to utilize available specialized test equipment.   However, sources should also have adequate laboratory facilities and equipment to perform some of the more unique requirements that are outside the capability of conducting them on-site at AFRL/MLS.  Prospective sources will be required to provide a full time technical staff including highly qualified engineers, technicians, and administrative support engaged in research and development activities on materials and manufacturing processes.  Responses must include the identity and resume of all personnel to be utilized.  Sources must provide documentation of relevant efforts and experience in each of the technical areas described below, which necessitates a quick reaction response to the requirements in a timely manner. Sources must include specific information related to capabilities in each area that indicates the organization's background, understanding of the problem, and personnel qualifications.  Sources must further demonstrate technical excellence in operating critical laboratory equipment located in AFRL/MLS in order to maintain a quick reaction capability and timely responsiveness.  Organizational brochures and letters of interest are unacceptable.  Sources are sought having the required knowledge and demonstrated capability to conduct and manage quick reaction support programs, as well as materials characterization and emerging materials transition programs of interest to the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate in support USAF, and other DoD weapon systems.  The primary objective of this program is to provide quick reaction support to the Air Force, including System Program Offices, Air Logistics Centers, and other Air Force Research Laboratories.  Quick reaction support will include component failure analysis, material and mechanical property evaluations, and characterization of corrosion/erosion behavior related to a wide variety of fielded weapon systems.  This program will also facilitate the transition of emerging materials and processing technologies to aerospace weapon systems.  The program will investigate materials and processing related issues from the development phase to the production and operational phases of advanced aerospace systems as well as aging systems.  This program is multi-disciplinary in that it covers the technology areas of structural materials, electronic materials, corrosion control, protective coatings, materials testing and evaluation, and logistics support for emerging materials and processes.  The program will initially consist of three (3) delivery orders that will include the following objectives:  first, to accomplish failure analysis on metallic and composite structural components and electrical (electronic) assemblies resulting from accident investigations, which will also include developing materials and processes preventing electrostatic discharge; second, to perform mechanical property evaluations and develop improved testing methodologies on a wide variety of metallic alloys and composite materials for a better understanding ofmaterial behavior and for developing mechanical property databases on emerging materials; third, to determine the behavior and environmental resistance of protective coatings and aerospace materials, which include assessing the effects of environmentally compliant processes on the corrosion performance of aerospace materials and/or hardware.  Firms responding should indicate whether they are a small business, an 8(a) firm, or a HUBZone program.  For this item, the general definition to be used to determine whether your firm is small is as follows:  "A small business concern is a concern that is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on government contracts and with its affiliates, and the number of employees does not exceed 500 persons."  NAIC 541710 applies.  "Concern means any business entity organization for profit, with a place of business in the United States, its possessions, Puerto Rico, or the trust Territory of the Pacific Islands including, but not limited to, an individual, partnership, corporation, joint venture, association or corporation."  The Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto.  All businesses interested in this effort must respond with a complete capability/qualification package describing the company's technical expertise and experience, personnel, and facilities to accomplish the work described above.  All respondents shall include in  the response their assigned commercial and Government entity code (Federal Supply Code for Manufacturers, a five digit code assigned by the Commander, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), Attn:  Customer Service Office, Battle Creek, MI, phone no.

<DESC>The pre-proposal package may be obtained in writing by facsimile = to (303) 445-6345 or mail to address listed above. Telephone requests = will not be honored. Pre-proposals must be submitted in accordance with = the instructions contained in the pre-proposal package and shall not = exceed six pages in length. Pre-proposals are due no later than = 03/31/02. The U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation = (Reclamation), is currently requesting pre-proposals for research and = pilot-plant activities sponsored by the DWPR Program. Through this = program, Reclamation is forming partnerships with private industry, = universities, local communities, and others to address a broad range of = desalting and water purification needs. The overall objective of the = program is to reduce the cost of desalting and water purification = technologies in order to augment water supply in the United States. The = Water Desalination Act of 1996, the authorizing legislation for this = program, defines the following important terms (note the definitions are = very broad and inclusive): (1) Desalination or desalting means "the use = of any process or technique for the removal and, when feasible, = adaptation to beneficial use, of organic and inorganic elements and = compounds from saline or biologically impaired waters, by itself or in = conjunction with other processes." (2) Saline water means "sea water, = brackish water, and other mineralized or chemically impaired water." For = fiscal year 2002, Reclamation is soliciting pre-proposals in: (1) four = (4) different research areas for projects of 12 months duration or less = (follow-on funding may be available for additional research studies, = pilot-plant projects, or future demonstration projects), and (2) the = Testing of Pilot-Scale Systems investigation area for projects of 24 = months duration or less (follow-on funding may be available for future = demonstration projects). The research awards amounts vary according to = the area of interest. For the pilot-scale agreements, and contingent = upon Congressional funding, a maximum amount of up to $270,000 per = agreement will be awarded for the investigations for the Reclamation = cost-share portion, as follows: amounts up to $150,000 for the first = year for pilot plant design, construction, and installation; and amounts = of up to $120,000 for an optional second year for testing, modification, = and evaluation. Offerors (other than academic institutions of higher = education) must be willing to cost-share 50% or more of the project = cost, depending on the financial need of the project. Offerors proposing = to provide additional cost-share will be given greater consideration. = Cost-sharing may be made through cash or in-kind contributions from the = offeror, or third party non-Federal participants. Cost-sharing is not = mandatory from academic institutions, but is strongly encouraged. The = authorizing legislation for this program provides for up to a total of = $1,000,000 per year to be awarded to academic institutions of higher = education, including United States-Mexico binational research = foundations and inter-university research programs established by the = two countries, without any cost-sharing requirement. No profit or fee = will be allowed. Patent rights for any developments will be retained by = the research partner (offeror) in accordance with provisions contained = in the solicitation. Reclamation's laboratory facilities are available = for use on a cost reimburseable basis. These include laboratory and = pilot-scale equipment at the Technical Service Center in Denver, = Colorado, and the state-of-the-art water treatment facility, the Water = Quality Improvement Center, in Yuma, Arizona. If you need detailed = information on these facilities and costs, please contact the above. Any = responsible source, to include individuals, academic institutions, = commercial or industrial organizations, private entities, public = entities (including state and local), or Indian Tribal Governments, may = submit a pre-proposal which will be considered by Reclamation. Foreign = entities, other than United States-Mexico binational research = foundations and inter-university research programs established by the = two countries, are not eligible for funding under the authorizing = legislation for this program. Federal agencies are not eligible to = apply. Pre-proposals will be reviewed for overall scientific and/or = technical merit; results from earlier successful research studies = indicating the project is at pilot-plant stage; potential contributions = to Reclamation's DWPR program objectives; qualifications of the = proposer; and reasonableness of the estimated project costs. Meritorious = pre-proposers will be encouraged to submit a full proposal. Submission = of a pre-proposal is not mandatory; however, offerors are strongly = encouraged to do so in order to receive the benefit of the initial = pre-proposal screening process. Solicitation packages for the full = proposals will be issued on or about 04/30/02, with a due date of = approximately 45 days after issuance. Brief descriptions of each area of = interest and their respective funding amounts are listed below. During = fiscal year 2002, Reclamation anticipates making the research awards in = the quantities listed below, subject to the content and quality of = proposals received for each emphasis area; however, should additional = funding become available, additional awards may be made. A list of = generic examples of the types of research and development opportunities = that will be considered are listed below for each emphasis area. These = examples will not necessarily be given preferential consideration over = unspecified research that also meets the goals of the program. For = fiscal year 2002, Reclamation anticipates the award of a total of four = (4) or five (5) financial assistance agreements of 12 months duration or = less, with Federal funds of $75,000 to $100,000 awarded for each of the = agreements, among the research and studies emphasis areas. TASK A - = MEMBRANE PROCESS RESEARCH AND STUDIES - The primary objective of this = task is to reduce the cost and increase the ease of operation of = membrane-based desalting and water treatment systems. Projects sponsored = under this emphasis area can apply to any portion of a membrane = treatment process including pretreatment related to membrane processes. = Examples of these projects include but are not limited to (1) = Development of integrated membrane systems (IMS), (2) Research on = techniques for membrane storage or preservation and for biological = control during plant operation, (3) Studies on adhesion of foulant or = other materials to membrane surfaces, (4) Studies on membrane cleaning, = including frequency and effectiveness, (5) Development of improved = membrane-containing element or stacks, (6) Increase of rates of mass = transfer to membrane surfaces, (7) Studies on influence of minor = components in groundwater on membrane properties, (8) Studies on = pretreatment specifically for membrane processes, (9) Studies on = presence and influence of biofilms on membranes, and (10) Development of = investigative techniques relating to membrane processes. TASK C - = NON-TRADITIONAL AND ALTERNATIVE DESALINATION RESEARCH AND STUDIES - = Research and development studies will focus on investigation of = non-traditional, or alternative desalination or water purification = techniques, to include the evaluation of economics and thermodynamic = efficiency of these processes. Examples of these projects include but = are not limited to (1) Development of new, innovative alternative = desalination processes, (2) Investigation of innovative techniques = combining desalination processes with renewable energy sources including = photovoltaic, wind power, solar thermal, and geothermal, and (3) = Investigation of freeze desalination and innovative combined = desalination processes. Only technologies with the potential of becoming = cost competitive with existing membrane and thermal processes will be = considered.

TASK E - ANCILLARY AND = ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS - This emphasis area addresses four aspects of the = authorizing legislation for this program that relate to the general = economic improvement of desalination processes (1) A method for = evaluating the economic implications of technological improvements is of = primary importance at this time. Reclamation has models for reverse = osmosis and nanofiltration that are sensitive enough for this purpose, = but needs models for electrodialysis, ion exchange, and thermal = desalting methods. If the costs of desalting are to be decreased through = this program it is vital that models for all desalting methods be = obtained so that the recent technological improvements made under this = program can be compared on an equal basis, (2) Studies optimizing cost = and/or design for different operating conditions, (3) Investigation of = methods for increasing the economic efficiency of desalination = processes, including hybrid systems or dual-purpose co-facilities with = other processes involving the use of water, (4) Detailed surveys of = construction and operating costs for desalination facilities with common = itemized categories of costs for each plant surveyed normalized to a = common basis. TASK F - CONCENTRATE ISSUES - Research and development = studies will evaluate the various problems related to concentrate = disposal, and develop innovative techniques to reduce concentrate = disposal costs and impacts on the environment. Examples of these = projects include but are not limited to (1) Recovery and use of = irrigation return flows, (2) Development of high salts complex mixtures, = (3) Creating products that use salts, (4) Concentrate disposal systems = development, (5) Recovery and use of concentrate by-products (dissolved = salts), (6) Salinity modeling and toxicity analysis of concentrate = discharges to the environment, (7) Substitution of brackish concentrate = for potable water in industrial applications, and (8) Removal of = supersaturated salts to permit further desalting of concentrate and = reduce the volume of concentrate requiring disposal. Only technologies = with the potential of becoming cost competitive with existing = alternative disposal methods will be considered. Proposed projects = should have the potential to become commercially viable and have wide = applicability.

<SUBJECT>D -- FirstGov Search Services
<DESC>The General Services Administration, Office of FirstGov, has a requirement for FirstGov Search Services.  Specifically, FirstGov provides a single high-level portal to all Federal and State Government websites.  As one service of FirstGov, a search capability is provided to allow users to locate content on Government websites.  The current contract for search technology is expiring in the near future.  This procurement is intended to provide replacement search capabilities and to add additional search functionality that has been requested by the agency clients.


The contractor shall provide the following services:

Organization of SOW & Responses
Instructions to Responders
Responses
Responses to the SOW should be divided into three sections: Required Services and Capabilities, Desirable Services and Capabilities, and Supporting Materials.  Responders are instructed to provide succinct responses that describe the specific terms, performance specifications, etc. that substantiate the responder?s claim to meet the requirement.  References to supporting materials to provide further context are encouraged.
Term of Contract
This contract will be for a term of one year.  The Government may choose to extend the contract for up to 4 additional option years, with renewal on a yearly basis.  The Government will notify the vendor in writing of its intent to extend, a minimum of 30 days in advance of the current expiration period.
Evaluation Criteria
The winning proposal will be evaluated on technical capability, completeness of solution, past performance, and price.  Proposals will first be checked to make sure that they meet the Mandatory Qualifications. Any proposals that do not meet the Mandatory Qualifications will not be considered further.
The technical proposal will be evaluated separately from the cost proposal. The Government will evaluate each technical response item and assign a numerical value that indicates the degree to which the Government believes that the response meets/exceeds the requirement.   This numerical value will be multiplied by a predetermined "importance factor" that indicates the relative importance of the particular requirement to the Government.  The sum of the values derived from this calculation will be used as the total point score to rank the technical proposals.  Technical proposals that are in the top 25% of point scores for required functionality will move forward to the cost evaluation phase.
Cost proposals will be evaluated on a total cost for the projected 5 year life of the contract, using a "time value of money" calculation, such that costs in early years are considered to be more expensive than the same dollar costs that occur in later years.
The Government reserves the right to choose not to accept any of the proposals.
Completeness of Solution
It is possible that no single vendor will be able to provide a solution that fully addresses all of the required services and capabilities of Section One of this Statement of Work.  Because the various requirements will have different relative importance in the evaluation, the Government may choose a solution that does not fully address all of the Required Services and Capabilities, but is still, in the opinion of the Government, the best overall solution. In this case, the Government may elect to meet these requirements using other resources outside the scope of this procurement. Mandatory Qualifications, which if not met, will disqualify the proposal from further consideration, are clearly identified in the Statement of Work.
Assumptions
For pricing purposes the following assumptions should be used:

Mandatory Qualifications
Experience
Vendors must be able to provide a reference installation with a minimum of 40 million pages under index in order to be considered.  Any proposals from vendors that cannot meet this specific requirement will not be considered.  The vendor should provide specific information describing their reference installation.  The government may choose to directly verify the reference installation.
Hosting
The vendor must propose a turn-key solution that includes hosting of the hardware, and installation and maintenance, and operation of software.  The solution must include the communication infrastructure necessary to spider and index the expected volumes of URLs/data and to provide search engine access for the expected number of search requests.  (See Assumptions in section 2.2.5)
Escrow of source code
The vendor must supply a plan for uninterrupted service delivery in the event that the vendor exits the search business.  The vendor and all his subcontractors must enter into an agreement to escrow the source code of all software provided in response to this document.
Scalability
The system should be scalable to handle an increase in the number of pages under index to 200 million without the response time for query increasing to more than .5 seconds per query, regardless of query complexity.  The vendor must specify what additional hardware will be required to support this increase in capacity.  The vendor must provide whatever hardware, in addition to that specified in this response at no additional charge to the Government in order to meet this specific response time 
Application Program Interface
An API must be provided to allow integration of the existing FirstGov.gov web front-end with the specified search capabilities.  The vendor must provide API documentation with their proposal response.
Obsolescence
The vendor shall set forth a plan by which the system provided shall not become obsolete.  This plan must at least include software support and maintenance for the correction of errors and providing of all releases, versions, changes, modifications, improvements, and updates to the software and supporting systems and its documentation introduced during the life of the contract, including all renewals thereof.
Support
A support plan renewable yearly is required.  Qualified and fully trained personnel must be available by phone 24/7/365 with the following response times:
	Normal business days, 8:00 - 5:00 pm (based on when the call is placed)
	Available by phone within 1 hour of placing call.
	Available on site within 2 hours of placing call if problem can not be resolved by phone within the first half hour.
	Weekends, holidays, and normal business days outside the hours of 8:00 - 5:00 pm (based on when the call is placed):
	Available by phone within 2 hour of placing call.
	Available on site within 4 hours of placing call if problem can not be resolved by phone within the first 2 hours.
Installation
The vendor must provide installation and configuration of all software in order to provide a complete working system to meet the initial performance requirements (.25 seconds per query on the  ~50 million pages under index).  This requirement includes installation of operating system software, backup and recovery software, utilities, and any other software necessary to make the proposed solution a "turn-key" operation.
Use of Existing Hardware
The existing hardware described in Appendix A will be in use by the current search technology until operation can be cut over to the new system, and service must be uninterrupted.  The Government requires that there be a 30-day period of concurrent operation with the existing search technology still in place, during which time the vendor must meet the service level requirements.  After that time, the full production operation can be cut over to the new solution, and installation can begin on the existing Government hardware.  After the service level can be met for an additional 15 days on the existing Government hardware, the concurrent operation can be terminated.   Since the Appendix A hardware will not be available to the vendor during the first 30 concurrent operation period, the vendor must provide the hardware necessary to operate the system in concurrent operation during the period specified.  If the system is down for more than the allowed time according to the service level agreement during the concurrent period, the concurrent period will restart at the beginning once the system is returned to operational state.  After 3 such restarts, the Government may, at its option, choose to restart additional times or to terminate the contract, at no cost to the Government.
Hardware failures of equipment furnished by the Government will not be counted against service level agreement performance.
Required Services and Capabilities
Indexing
1.1.1.2	Indexing of web content in the following formats is required: HTML, PDF, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, ASCII (.txt), and XML.
1.1.1.3	The system must be able to crawl and index and make available the entire current FirstGov.gov indexed content (~50 million pages) in no more than seven (7) days using the existing server configurations.  It is expected that the number of spidered pages will increase from the current ~50 million to ~200 million in the next 36 to 48 months.  The vendor must assure that as the number of spidered pages increases the total time to index the collection does not exceed the seven day limit. The successful vendor will be required to demonstrate this capability during the final system acceptance phase.  (See ?Installation? under the ?Services? section below.)
1.1.1.4	The system must be able to provide a maximum .25 second response time on any query of the current FirstGov.gov indexed content (~50 million pages) as measured on a client locally connected to the search server.  A typical internet user of the search system must see a response time of no greater than 5 seconds.  The successful vendor will be required to demonstrate this capability during the final system acceptance phase.  (See ?Installation? under the ?Services? section below.)
1.1.1.5	The system must provide the capability to provide an on-demand re-index and scheduled (regularly scheduled (~0.1% of the total pages spidered or 50,000 pages) and one time scheduled) crawl of specified URL's in order to make those pages available in the index immediately without the need to wait for completion of a full index cycle.  The regularly scheduled re-indexing crawls must be performed in a one hour period; one-time crawls must be available in minutes. In each of these cases, a search by a typical internet user must not employ search terms or results derived from the previous contents of any of these changed pages.
1.1.1.6	Indexing on the entire 65,536 character Unicode character set is required.
1.1.1.7	The system must provide the capability to index databases across the web via ODBC.  
1.1.1.8	Rooting and stemming of words should be supported at indexing time so that there is no performance penalty at search time for searches that rely on roots/stems.  (See searching below).
1.1.1.9	The system must support field level indexing for database content, XML content, and HTML (title, meta, h1, etc. tagged fields). 
1.1.1.10	The system must provide a mechanism that ensures that links that are not accessible are removed from the index on a timely basis (at least weekly).
Searching
1.1.1.11	Search results must be provided for display, ranked by relevance, with the search keywords provided in the context (KWIC) of a paragraph of the document.  This is a required capability for HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word content.  The type of document found and its size must be indicated in the hit list.  
1.1.1.12	The search engine must be able to categorize the search results according to a taxonomy of words and phrases. The vendor should specify whether their system requires a pre-defined taxonomy, can automatically generate a taxonomy, or both.
1.1.1.13	Search terms must be identified in the returned results list.
1.1.1.14	Searching on the entire 65,536 character Unicode character set is required.
1.1.1.15	The system must support field level searching for database content, XML content, and HTML (title, meta, h1, etc. tagged fields).  It must be possible to return a query result set by combining field level query commands with full text query commands.
1.1.1.16	The system must support Boolean searches of full text and fielded content including AND, OR, and NOT.
1.1.1.17	Searches may be submitted as individual words, phrases, or sentences. The system must automatically recognize common phrases in the query and rank results containing those phrases higher than results containing the individual words that are not in the context of the phrase.  For example, if the search phrase was "white house" then a document containing the phrase "George Bush lives in the White House" would be rated higher than one containing "Al's house is also white".  
1.1.1.18	The system must allow for  "rooting" and "stemming" of search terms, so a search containing the word "schooling" would return hits of documents containing "school", "schooled", etc.
Other System Capabilities
1.1.1.19	The vendor must provide an interface that is accessible programmatically and across the web that will allow agency sites to submit queries and receive query results for inclusion in agency pages.  
1.1.1.20	The system should provide collection of metrics on queries, information under index, and other useful statistics.  The vendor should include with the proposal a description of the statistics collected and the available reports on those statistics.
Services
Training
Administration training will be provided to a maximum of 5 persons designated by the Government to receive such training.  Training will include written procedure on all aspects of system operation and maintenance including start-up, shutdown, backup, recovery and search software administration and configuration. Each person in training should have the opportunity to personally perform each system operation and to exercise each capability of search engine administration and configuration during the training sessions.  
Development Consulting
The vendor will provide all assistance needed by FirstGov developers in integrating the existing FirstGov web front-end with the search engine.  [Need to put specifics on the amount of assistance required or do time and materials].
The successful vendor will be required to create a ?web authoring standard? to describe to web content creators the most effective ways to markup their content to support indexing by the vendor?s product.  An outline in table of contents format listing the topics that will be addressed in this standard should be included with this proposal response.  Any costs for creating the ?web authoring standard? document should be included in the costs section of the proposal.
 
Desirable Services and Capabilities
Indexing
Configurablility
1.1.1.21	While the content available across all of the government web sites is very diverse, it is possible to some extent to coordinate the content formatting and tagging across many of the sites in order to realize a higher relevancy on the query results.  It is desirable that the search engine be highly configurable to allow the government to define the criteria by which search results will be ranked.  A partial list of possible criteria that might affect rankings include:
How recently the page content has been updated.
Whether the agency name was mentioned in the query.
Whether a query term appeared in a specially tagged area of the content (for example in an XML tag).
How many times the term appeared within the content item.
The number of times the item appeared within the content item as a percentage of the total number of words in the content.
The similarity of the word order in the query as compared to the word order in the content item.
How frequently the link has been accessed.
The ?buy a word? strategy, where pages can be designated to be the highest relevance for specific words or phrases.
There are undoubtedly many more ways to evaluate this.  The vendor should describe the algorithms used for relevance ranking and also describe the extent to which these algorithms are configurable.  Indicate at what point the configuration options take effect (index time, query time, etc.) and any effects on performance or cost.
1.1.1.22	It is desirable that bound phrases, synonyms, proper nouns, etc., be configurable for indexing on a per domain or per URL list basis.  For example, the word ?interference? has totally different synonyms when indexing content from the Patent and Trademark Office than when  indexing content from the Federal Communications Commission.

<SUBJECT>R -- Remote Airfield Monitoring Ground Sensor Evaluation
<DESC>Title: Remote Airfield Monitoring Ground Sensor Evaluation.

    The Air Armament Center, Joint Munitions Test and Evaluation Program Office, Project CHICKEN LITTLE (CL), Eglin AFB FL in support of the Counter Drug Technology Development Program Office (CDTDPO) and Central MASINT Technology Coordination Office (CMTCO) intends to conduct a demonstration and evaluation of available sensor equipment to detect personnel, vehicles and aircraft on remote airfields . Industry is invited to participate in these demonstration/evaluations by bringing their sensors to a planned test activity to  be conducted 20/21 March 2002 at Eglin AFB Fl. These sensor devices must be capable of operating for months from a battery pack, and of transmitting detection data over long distances to a command center.
    The goal of the CDTDPO is to develop technology and prototype systems to enhance the Counter-Drug capability of the Department of Defense and, as appropriate, civilian law enforcement agencies consistent with the goals of the National Drug Control Strategy, Congressional Direction, and the DOD mission.  The CDTDPO, working with the CMTCO and Chicken Little at Eglin AFB is interested in trying to determine what is available in industry to meet these requirements.
    Target sets and ground truth will be provided on range at Eglin AFB.  Vendors/companies having systems that will detect and/or classify aircraft and vehicles should contact the POC, Mr William Terrell, Sverdrup Tech, 850-882-7636, for a copy
of "Plan of Action, Hand Emplaced Acoustic-Seismic Airfield Monitoring
Sensor Test and Demonstration".  Attendance will be strictly limited to essential personnel per sensor system and only organizations  having equipment to demonstrate will be allowed to participate.
	Offerors will be responsible for providing all necessary insurance for personnel and hardware, hold harmless agreements, etc., to conduct activities on a US Government installation.  It is CL policy that data collected and retained during this event will be protected as propriety and securely stored at the appropriate classification level(s) and will be included in the on?going CL data-basing activity.  Data will not be released/disseminated without consent of the owner/sponsor of the hardware. 
              A planning meeting will be held on 5 March 2002 at Eglin AFB, 08:30hrs, Building 846.  It is recommended that interested parties attend this meeting.  However, this is not required, but prior clearance and approval to participate is required. Demonstration requirements will be reviewed at this time.  Range assets and facilities will be discussed and a range tour will be conducted.  
    Since this is not a request for a formal contract award, there will be no Request for Proposal (RFP), nor will any binding selection criteria be prepared.  Participation is not subject to the Contracts Dispute Act of 1978 and not subject to arbitration or dispute.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.
