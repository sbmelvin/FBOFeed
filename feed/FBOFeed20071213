This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the ImageTrac Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the ImageTrac Scanner as the U.S. Passport application process is a paper-based process with a variety of different document types being scanned.  IBML systems provide unique paper track handling for the Passport environment and have proven reliable and technologically advanced in the marketplace over the past 10 years.  CA/CST/PS has chosen the IBML system for the following reasons: -	No other vendor has demonstration the ability to handle the unique needs of the Passport scanning environment, which includes scanning packets that can include applications, supporting documentation such as an old Passport, FedEx envelopes, etc. -	IBML scanners are uniquely able to process, at high speed, the wide variety of documents Passport scans including documents with staples. -	IBML scanners are already integrated with Passportýs key systems and support infrastructure from an operations and maintenance perspective. -	The IBML technology has been a reliable component of the Passport Systems architecture for almost 10 years. -	IBML has continued to work with CST to assure that the scanning platforms remain compatible with Passport-specific needs -	IBML can support the time constraints to deliver the equipment to DoS, as well as the custom software tools (API) to control scanner elements from within TDIS -	Changing scanner technology would incur a length integration, test, and certification cycle which is currently untenable for the business. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system.<BR><BR>CST currently has 39 IBML ImageTrac systems deployed to support Passport Systems scanning requirements.  These requirements include scanning Passport applications as they are received to collect applicantýs photos digitally for the Passport book as part of the TDIS Photo Digitalization process, as well as the archiving of annotated/adjudicated Passport applications as part of the PRISM system.  Recently, the Passport application workload has increased dramatically, going from 12 million to 18 million in FYý07.  In support of this increase in Passport demand, the Department of State now has a need to procure six (6) additional ImageTrac scanners in order to keep up with its application workload, and modernize the Passport Systems to support advanced scanning/imaging features that will increase productivity, image quality, and consistency amongst processing facilities. Over 50 million Passport applications have been processed on these devices which have been integrated and tested with Passportýs core issuance system, TDIS.  Incorporating additional ImageTrac scanners into the existing enterprise will provide a direct increase in capacity while enabling Passport to evolve its approach to scanning and document imaging.<BR><BR>

This requirement is being issued to enhance existing hardware. It is needed in support of MDAýs mission: Develop and field an integrated BMDS capable of providing a layered defense for the homeland, deployed forces, friends, and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight. The Missile Defense Agencyýs mission is to develop, test, and prepare for deployment a missile defense system. Using complementary interceptors, land, sea, and air space based sensors, and battle management command and control systems, the planned missile defense system will be able to engage all classes and ranges of ballistic missile threats. Our programmatic strategy is to develop, rigorously test, and continuously evaluate production, deployment and operational alternatives for the ballistic missile defense system. Missile defense systems being developed and tested by MDA are primarily based on hit-to-kill technology. IT has been described as hitting a bullet with a bullet ý a capability that has been successfully demonstrated in test after test. No other software exists that affords the capability. Hitachi hardware has been adopted by MDAýs program and this interface is the only one that will work with this existing hardware architecture. Any other type of support will add extra costs of an additional hardware interface. There is only one responsible hardware product and no other support will satisfy the agencyýs requirements because of equipment requirements. Failure to provide this single type of hardware support will have a significant adverse effect on the programýs mission.<BR><BR>

DIS imagery output includes both industry standard and government-specific output formats such as GeoTIFF, JPEG 2000, NITF 2.1, and RPF CIB. The DIS resides at each of five geographically-separated Eagle Vision sites: Ramstein Air Base Germany, San Diego, CA, Eastover, SC, Honolulu, HI, and Montgomery, AL.  Each DIS system comprises six independent workstations (mix of desktops and laptops), a Local Area Network (LAN), shared storage devices, printers, and plotters.  Each workstation contains multiple commodity COTS applications software for imagery, office automation, and geospatial processing applications, including Leica's ERDAS Imagine and ESRI's ArcGIS.  The sustainment effort will also support one workstation with all DIS software at the Air Force Combat Support Office (AFCSO) in the Pentagon, Washington, DC.  Additional informational about the locations and hardware/software configuration of the DIS systems may be found on the Hanscom Electronic Request for Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB),  http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/.

<DESC>CLIENT AGENCY:  Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection (DHS, CBP), and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service - Veterinary Services (USDA, APHIS-VS).

SIZE:  Existing 12 acres, with approximately 2 additional acres will be required for the expansion requirements of this port for a total of 14 acres.

3 combination High Occupancy Vehicles (HOV)/bus/Recreational Vehicle (RV)/bicycle/non-commercial primary lanes, 8 expandable to 12 Privately Owned Vehicles (POV)/non-commercial primary inspection lanes; and other major facilities as described below.

BUDGET:  Estimated Construction Cost Award between $60,000,000 and $80,000,000.

FUNDING:  Funds Are Not Currently Available

GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:  35% of contract effort must be performed in the State of Arizona

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation?s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings/facilities of outstanding quality and value.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements including the P100 (Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service), the U.S. Land Port of Entry Design Guide, and the CBP Security and IT Supplemental Guide, dated June 29, 2007.  As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals, including the new standards mandated by U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005), security requirements, and the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS).  The facility will be designed in metric units.  The project will have a goal of a Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The San Luis I LPOE is located in San Luis, Arizona at the International border and Arizona State Road 95.  Since its construction in 1984, this Port has experienced dramatic growth in traffic volumes.  There have been major increases in all modes of traffic through this Port.  Population growth, increased law enforcement activities, national security requirements, changes in trade policies, and outdated facilities and technology have render this Port in need of expansion, upgrade, and repair.

The goal of this project is to reconfigure and expand the existing facilities and move the commercial inspection operation to a new San Luis II LPOE and dedicate this facility into a state-of-the-art Privately Owned Vehicles (POV), High Occupancy Vehicles (HOV)/Recreational Vehicles (RV)/bicycle, and pedestrians inspection processing facility.  The work will include demolition, renovation, and new construction.  The project will include the renovation of the existing Main Building, primary POV inspection booths, secondary POV inspection stations, pedestrian primary and secondary inspection area, HOV/RV inspection area, head house, screened impound inspection area, Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) area, seized property vault relocation, expansion of the kennels, generator backup, incinerator relocation, outbound facility, governmental parking areas, and associated roadwork to facilitate the renovated site.  In addition, the project will incorporate cost-effective and innovative strategies to meet EPACT 2005 energy goals to reduce energy consumption.  The project will also incorporate a commissioning agent that will be involved throughout the project from design inception through occupancy.

The Port will remain active during the renovation work.  The phasing of work must not interfere with the port operation.  Temporary facilities shall be incorporated into the design and construction to maintain Port security and operations during construction.
The final design should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the efficient movement of trade and commerce, the security requirements of law enforcement agencies, the new standards mandated by EPACT 2005, and the welcoming of visitors and citizens to the United States of America. 

A traditional design-bid-build, fixed price contract will be the contract method used on this project.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum:  Professional architecture services, landscape architecture services, engineering, traffic engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, life cycle cost analysis, Computer-Aided Design (CAD), including Building Information Modeling (BIM) - (GSA requiring spatial program building information models as a minimum requirement for submissions to the Office of the Chief Architect for final concept approvals by the PBS Commissioner; GSA supports the use in all projects of mature 3D-4D-BIM technologies - spatial program validation and beyond - at strategic project phases in support of specific project challenges) and Post-Construction Contract Services (PCCS).  The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service), including LEED Silver certification; EPACT 2005 compliance; customer agency requirements, including the U.S. Land Port of Entry Design Guides.  All facilities, existing and new, incorporated in the design, shall conform to the latest building codes, including but not limited to the most current seismic standards, security requirements, utility systems, fire safety, and the ABAAS.

<DESC>REQUIREMENTS:<br>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps) for a parcel of land.  FEMA is seeking expressions of interest from owners of vacant parcels of land within a 20-mile radius of the city center (451 Florida Street) of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  General Services Administration (GSA) will enter into a lease contract on behalf of FEMA with the owner whose parcel of land is technically acceptable for the intended use of the Government. <br><br>

The intended use of the leased land is to provide storage for travel trailers and/or mobile homes which were used by the Louisiana Housing Task Force as temporary emergency housing units (EHU) to those individuals displaced from their permanent residences by Hurricane Katrina.  These EHU will not be occupied. <br><br>

FEMA intends to lease only the land that is determined to meet all the governmental technical requirements.  The determination of technical acceptability is made by the GSA Contracting Officer.  In making a determination, the GSA Contracting Officer will use technical criteria provided by FEMA program officials, other federal agencies guidelines and technical contractors who are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the site.  The determination process is two-phased.  The first phase will use the criteria listed in this ad to determine if expressions of interest meet the minimum criteria for the intended use by the Government.  Those individuals responding with an expression of interest that meet these minimum criteria will be provided with a Solicitation for Offer (SFO).  The second phase of determination is based upon the additional technical requirements specified within the SFO.  Only the offers that meet all the technical requirements of both this ad and the SFO will be considered for award.<br><br>

Land owners who meet the following minimum criteria are requested to provide expressions of interest to GSA:<br>

1.	Land which is located within a 20-mile radius to the city center of Baton Rouge, Louisiana (451 Florida Street).<br><br>
2.	Parcels of Land no smaller than 300 and no larger than 540 acres.<br><br>
3.	Land that is flat and hard-surfaced (no loose soil and no crop lands), cleared of trees, debris and other impediments to support travel trailers and mobile homes.<br><br>
4. 	Land owner will allow placement of gravel/rock on roadways and lanes on the property with possible culvert/piping to make property more accessible and conducive to staging travel trailers and mobile homes.<br><br>
5.	Land that has direct access from primary/secondary paved roads.  Preference is for land with a minimum of 200 feet frontage on these roads.<br><br>
6.	Land that has water, sewerage and electric service is required.<br><br>
7.	Land that is not wetlands.<br><br>
8.	Land that meets local government ordinances, zoning requirements, and any other necessary approvals for government intended use (parish approval required).<br><br>
9.	Land that complies with all necessary environmental, archeological and historical regulations.<br><br>
10.	Occupancy is required by February 1, 2008. <br><br>

The expression of interest should include, as a minimum, the following information: <br>

1.	Owner name, address, phone number, fax number, and email address if available.<br><br>
2.	Written proof of ownership and/or of the legal control necessary to lease the land (e.g. copy of deed, mortgage document, or master lease stating the ability to sublease for the governments intended use).<br><br>
3.	A legal description of the property.<br><br>
4.	Description of the land:  size (number of acres), physical characteristics, past and current use.<br><br>
5.	Location of the land:  including the municipal (physical) address, city, parish, and a small map showing the location and access to the property.<br><br>
6.	Picture of the site.<br><br>
7.	If representing an owner, a written agreement with the owner showing authority to represent the owner.<br><br>
8.	Parish and City approval documents.<br><br>

All expressions of interest shall be addressed as follows and mailed to:<br><br>
General Services Administration 
Expression of Interest to Vacant Land
3535 S. Sherwood Forest Blvd., Suite 150
Baton Rouge, LA 70816<br><br>

SOLICITATION PROCESS:<br><br>
Typically, GSA will solicit offers from all technically acceptable sites.  Site acceptability will be established by the process of determination described above and within the Solicitation for Offer.  The leasing action will be awarded to the lowest price technically acceptable offer.<br><br>

DELINEATED AREA:<br><br>
Property offered to the Government in conjunction with this requirement must be located within a 20-mile radius to the city center (451 Florida Street) of Baton Rouge, in the state of Louisiana .<br><br>

LEASE TERM:<br><br>
2 years, 1- year firm term. <br><br>

RENTAL RATE:<br><br>
An annual rate of return on the estimated value of the selected site is offered as a lease rental payment.  The Government will not accept an increased value assessment or an excessive interest rate due to the nature of this requirement.  The intent of the Government is not to operate a commercial business on the property and, therefore, there is no income for consideration in determining a fair rental rate.<br><br>

RIGHT-OF-ENTRY FORM:<br><br>
The owner will be required to provide access and entry onto the property to FEMA and its representatives for the purpose of performance of environmental and other assessment to determine technical feasibility for intended use.<br>

The Luigs and Neumann Infrapatch clamp set up combines three motorized micromanipulators mounted on a state of the art motorized XY translation base plate platform.  These manipulators are remote controlled and are precise, drift free and free from the hysteretic problems associated with most commercial manipulators.  Movements of the manipulators are controlled by a keypad with multiple movement speed-range, a home function for ease of electrode change during recording, memory for individual storage coordinates and most importantly movement in all four axis of 0.1 micron.  This microelectrode assembly is custom made to be mounted on a Zeiss Arioso 2 FS microscope (which already exits in the NICHD?s laboratory) and the whole recording apparatus positioned on moveable base plate which allows independent freedom of movement for all manipulators at all times.  The combination of the Luigs and Neumann Infrapatch system and the Zeiss upright microscope provides outstanding aberration-free images, integration of different types of illumination and a great versatility.  In addition all attachments to this system presently used in the NICHD laboratory are completely compatible with the Infra patch system.  No other combination of commercially available micromanipulators of this quality exists for the type of experiments to be performed in the NICHD laboratory.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 5.201, the General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service is herby synopsizing the following proposed commercial item contract action:  

The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Region 3, Philadelphia intends to purchase through other than full and open competition pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 LingoLogix GoCode.  In accordance with FAR 8.401(d), for administrative convenience, this open market item will be purchased through a competitive GSA IT 70 Schedule buy. The order will be issued as a Time and Materials type order.     

Summary of the Requirement:  The requiring activity is the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  The VA requires implementation and test support for a pilot, computerized coding system which will utilize Lingologix GoCode. The contractor will be responsible for 1) testing the accuracy and consistency of GoCode E&M coding software; 2) evaluating the impact and value add of GoCode software on clinician and HIM VHA workflow and processes; and 3) creating a searchable database of codified encounter notes that can be used for decision support and analysis.  If the accuracy and consistency of GoCode is found to be equal to or better than human coders, then fewer human coders will be needed, potentially reducing the amount of money currently spent on outsourcing for re-coding all billable cases.  

The period of performance for this requirement is to be determined at this time. 

Summary of the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition:  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(c), this acquisition uses a brand name description or other description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer.  The use of such descriptions in the acquisition is essential to the Government?s requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 4:00 P.M. December 20, 2007 will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

Evidence must be provided of ability to perform the required printing.  Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Linda.S.Statler@noaa.gov.

CLDP is supporting the U.S. Government Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) by providing technical assistance to a group of countries in the Middle East to improve their legislative and regulatory frameworks, and ultimately, to facilitate the region preparedness for the Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA).

2.3       Coordinate with CLDP legal staff and legal advisors regarding the implementation of newly drafted commercial laws, including, but not limited to assisting with the implementation of CLDP training programs for judges, lawyers, law professors, and other jurists in the US and abroad.

2.4       Draft progress reports and provide updates/information per CLDP/Washington office requests.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service has an upcoming requirement for the completion of a Nutrient Management Plan, Conservation Plan, and Recordkeeping and Nutrient Management Plan Implementation as part of a comprehensive nutrient management plan (CNMP). A CNMP is a grouping of conservation practices and management activities which, when combined into a system, will help ensure that both production and natural resource conservation goals are achieved for animal feeding operations.  The Nutrient Management Plan involves developing nutrient budgets (for all sources of nutrients used on the farm) based on crop needs, existing soil nutrient levels, and soil nutrient thresholds. The plan will include appropriate documents and field maps that identify the land base necessary to effectively utilize the manure produced.  The Conservation Plan includes the development of conservation and management practices required to minimize the movement of nutrients on the landscape and conserve the nutrient value for crop production.  This includes the planning and design of practices that address tillage and crop rotation systems, erosion and runoff control and conservation buffers.  Record-keeping and Nutrient Management Plan Implementation includes the collection of soil/manure samples, evaluating planned crop nutrient needs, calculating appropriate manure application rates, calibrating equipment and filing appropriate records for documentation.  Place of performance will be in various counties within South Dakota.  NAICS code is 541620.  The Request for Proposal will be available on or about December 7, 2007.   Successful proposals may result in multiple awards.  Resulting contract or contracts will be of an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity type consisting of a base year and four option years.  Task orders placed against the contract are subject to negotiations according to the terms and conditions contained therein, and under the guidelines provided in FAR Part 15.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) intends to award modifications to its Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts extending each contracts ordering pe riod consistent with the terms identified within this announcement.  The FRR program requirements are currently executed via firm fixed price and/or time and materials task orders which are placed against five (5) ID/IQ contracts in order to provide quick response for facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, additions, construction, equipment procurement / installation, and maintenance services on installed equipment/systems at Government installations and facilities.  All current contract award s were made under full and open competition procedures.  The ordering period for these contracts will expire in January 2008.  As a result, CEHNC is developing its acquisition strategy and conducting pre-award functions for the follow-on FRR acquisitions, under NAICS code 236220.  The solicitation(s) for the follow-on acquisitions were released in July 2007 with the projected awards to be made in Spring 2008.  Due to the lapse in coverage, it is necessary that the current contracts be extended to compensate  for the period in which there would have been no contract coverage.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) intends to award modifications to its Medical Repair and Renewal (MRR) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts extending each contracts ordering per iod consistent with the terms identified within this announcement.  The MRR program requirements are currently executed via firm fixed price and/or time and materials task orders which are placed against four (4) ID/IQ contracts in order to provide quick r esponse for facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, additions, construction, equipment procurement / installation, and maintenance services on installed equipment/systems at Government installations and facilities.  All current contract awards  were made under full and open competition procedures.  The ordering period for these contracts will expire in January 2008.  As a result, CEHNC is developing its acquisition strategy and conducting pre-award functions for the follow-on MRR acquisitions, u nder NAICS code 236220.  The solicitation(s) for the follow-on acquisitions were released in July 2007 with the projected awards to be made in Spring 2008.  Due to the lapse in coverage, it is necessary that the current contracts be extended to compensate for the period in which there would have been no contract coverage.  Therefore, it is the Governments intention to modify the current MRR ID/IQ contracts to extend the ordering period by six (6) months with an additional three (3) month option period.  On ce the follow-on acquisitions are awarded, ordering against the current contracts will cease.  The Government will not exercise the additional three (3) month option should the follow-on acquisitions be awarded prior to the period in which the additional t hree (3) month option would be exercised.<BR><BR>The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows:  DACA87-03-D-0008 (John J.

<DESC>The Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE NNSA) seeks qualified small businesses, small business-led teams and joint ventures that qualify as small businesses capable in providing a range of logistical and administrative support, paramilitary training, property management, and technical support services required to assist the Office of Secure Transportation (OST).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 561210, ýýýFacilities Support Servicesýýý, with a small business size standard of $32.5 Million.  DOE NNSA is planning to conduct a competitive acquisition using the procedures delineated in FAR Part 15. The estimated ceiling amount of the five year contract (2-year basic period and three 1-year options) is $100 Million. The anticipated effective date for the new contract is January 2009. Technical Requirements The contractor must be capable of providing the activities of logistical, curricula development and training, munitions support, project control, shipping and receiving, fleet vehicle management, OST property management, program and management analysis, data entry support and administrative support.  The activities of curricula/training, munitions support, shipping and receiving, OTS property management, and administrative support will primarily take place on-site at DOE/NNSA OST Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Primary logistics support is located at DOE/NNSA OST Fort Chaffee, Arkansas and will consist of operating and maintaining the Training Command at Fort Chaffee, assisting in the training of the Special Agent Force, providing division support in areas of procurement, budget, property management, and supporting all provisional Satellite Training Operations throughout the country. The contractor will provide support that ensures the facilities, grounds, vehicles, ranges, and training venues are properly maintained for safe and efficient use. Additionally, the contractor will provide complete supply and logistic functions, armorer function, fleet management function, and security and safety functions.  The contractor will also be required to provide DOE ýýýLýýý cleared drivers to accomplish logistical vehicle movements throughout the continental United States.  The remaining work will take place at other sites as directed. Current Contract Environment There is currently one Master Contract with a period of performance from August 18, 2003 through August 17, 2008, awarded to a large business, Wackenhut Services, Inc.  To date, DOE NNSA has awarded seven tasks with a total value over $88 million.  Contract will be extended through February 17, 2009 due to scheduled mission critical validation exercises.  The profile of the task award values are as follows: Task Value Range Number of Tasks <$100K 1 $100K up to $1M 2 $1M up to $5M 2 >$5M 2 It is anticipated that as part of this requirement, the successful contractor will be required to maintain offices at the DOE NNSA OST Albuquerque, New Mexico, site and at the DOE NNSA OST Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, site throughout the life of the contract that are adequately staffed to povide support in accordance with the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  As a result of the sensitive nature of the DOE NNSA OST mission the successful contractor, and its subcontractors or team members, will be required to have an affirmative determination of Foreign Ownership, Control and Clearance (FOCI). In addition, many contractor personnel performing on the contract will be required to obtain and maintain DOE ýýýLýýý or ýýýQýýý level security clearances. Since this sources sought synopsis is being used strictly to determine if sufficient small business capability exists to set this acquisition aside, large businesses should not reply. In order to be evaluated as capable for purpose of a set aside determination, a small business must be able to perform a majority of the Draft PWS. Teaming Emphasis Given the type, size, and complexity of work envisioned for this requirement, DOE NNSA recommends that small businesses should consider teaming arrangement. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 9.603), the Government will recognize the integrity and validity of contractor team arrangements; provided the arrangements are identified and company relationships are fully disclosed in an offer or, for arrangements entered into after submission of an offer, before the arrangement becomes effective. A contractor team arrangement is one where two or more companies form a partnership or joint venture to act as a potential prime contractor or a prime contractor agrees with one or more companies to have them act as its subcontractors under a specified Government contract or acquisition program. Small businesses can form a number of teaming arrangements that may include, but not be limited to: prime/sub, an SBA-approved Mentor Protýýgýý, a joint venture, an SBA-approved Mentor Protýýgýý Joint Venture. Small businesses should consult applicable regulations related to the teaming approach under consideration to ensure compliance with the size standard (e.g., affiliation rules or subcontracting limitations). Interested small business concerns are requested to submit (1) an expression of interest (EOI) and (2) a statement of capabilities (SOC), no later than 5 PM Mountain Time on January 11,  2008.  The expression of interest shall state whether the concern is a Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) Small Business, HUBZone Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Veteran-owned Small Business or a Service-disabled Veteran-owned small business and shall not exceed two (2) pages. The SOC shall not exceed ten (10) pages and shall include the interested firmýýýs complete mailing address, point of contact (name, telephone number, and e-mail address). The SOC shall also disclose any prime/sub, SBA-approved Mentor Protýýgýý, joint venture, or SBA-approved Mentor Protýýgýý Joint Venture arrangement. In addition, the SOC shall include the following information ýýý for prime/subcontractor arrangement all subcontractors shall be identified to include name, phone number and email address of each subcontractorýýýs point of contact, for Mentor Protýýgýý arrangement the Mentor shall be identified to include name, phone number and email address of the Mentorýýýs point of contact, for joint venture arrangement all partners to the joint venture should be identified to include name, phone number and email address of each partnerýýýs point of contact.  The SOC shall list the prime contract (and significant subcontractor) work performed by all teaming partners since February 2003 including (1) a brief description of experience with each of the functional areas including the magnitude, complexity and criticality of the work performed, (2) name and address of the contracting activity, (3) name and telephone number of the contracting officerýýýs technical representative and (4) prime contract number. Contractors must provide a narrative for each contract or subcontract addressing how its experience directly relates to the specific technical knowledge and capabilities requirements identified above and associated with the PWS.  The SOC should include statement to whether a firm has a current affirmative Foreign Ownership, Control and Influence (FOCI) determination, the date the determination was rendered, and the current level of security clearance possessed by the firm. In addition to the above, provide a statement describing how your company might propose to perform the percentage of work specified in Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14(b)(2) -- (At least 50 percent of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern). If two or more business concerns have formed a joint venture or teaming arrangement, identify the demonstrated capabilities of each business to perform the work described in the Technical Requirements section above and the roles and responsibilities of each business in the accomplishment of the requirements. Only electronic copies of the expression of interest and SOC sent to mvasquez@doeal.gov will be accepted. Any questions or comments regarding this announcement should be e-mailed to mvasquez@doeal.gov or submitted thru IIPS. Telephone responses and inquiries will not be accepted. This notice is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. DOE/NNSA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this Notice. No solicitation exists at this time. Please be advised that all information submitted will be considered procurement sensitive. Information which the Contractor considers ýýýBid and Proposal Informationýýý or ýýýProprietary Informationýýý pursuant to existing laws and regulations must be marked accordingly [see FAR 3.104-1 (3) & (4)].

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Justice, National Security Division anticipates a competitive procurement for Cisco brand name equipment off of the NASA SEWP IV Contract. This brand name intent is for reasons of performance, cost, and time. This acquisition is for additional network components.  The mission of the NSD is to carry out the Department?s highest priority: to combat terrorism and other threats to national security. The existing network infrastructure, both LAN and WAN, is based on Cisco equipment.  This new equipment must be fully compatible with all existing communications protocols and management tools. The specified brand is required for compatibility with the existing equipment base as well as with equipment interfacing from other agencies. This equipment is specified in our system security certification and accreditation documents, and changing the brand of equipment would require a new certificate and accreditation process. Furthermore, all NSD routing and switching expertise is with Cisco. NSD has a considerable training investment in staff specifically trained and certified on this equipment. NSD does not have the resources to utilize other infrastructure options at this time. Maintaining one consistent brand across all routing and switching equipment is required and enables NSD to effectively manage the network with less complexity, thus facilitating network uptime, management, and security. The brand and model(s) contained herein are essential to the Government?s immediate and mission-critical requirement.   
		
Purchase of non-compatible equipment will put undue risk on network support infrastructures, increase risk of network outages, and cause need for additional training and follow-on maintenance contracts above and beyond the Department of Justice?s Support Agreement with Cisco. Responses to this notice must be in writing and must be received by 3:00pm on December 14, 2007. Vendor shall certify that it is a Manufacturer Authorized Channel Partner as of the date of the submission of their quote, and that it has the certification/specialization level required by the Manufacturer to support both the product sale and product pricing, in accordance with the applicable Manufacturer certification/specialization requirements. Unless otherwise specified, Vendor shall warrant that the products are new, in their original box.

The Government contemplates award of a firm fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will not consider proposals received after the RFQ close date. The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 423430, and the size standard is 100. No additional synopsis will be published, and a solicitation will only be issued to SEWP IV contract holders. The point of contact for this Request for Quotation is Sheila Gear Israel and all responses should be emailed to sheila.g.israel@usdoj.gov or faxed to (202) 353-2031.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command is soliciting information from industry to determine potential contractors who have the skills, experience, qualifications, and knowledge required to successfully design, develop, integrate, test, qualify, and produce a low cost replacement Container for the All-Up-Round (AUR) Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW). The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assess current industry experience, capabilities, and interest in a full and open competition to satisfy the objectives identified herein. NAVAIR intends to use the information provided in response to this RFI to aid in refining its acquisition strategy, budgeting assumptions, statement of work, and performance specification.

This Sources Sought is the first of several future announcements advertising this requirement. NAVAIR plans to issue a separate Sources Sought announcement which will include the Government's draft contract and performance specification. In addition, NAVAIR plans to host an Industry Day meeting. A firm time/date will be announced at a later date.

A competitive performance-based specification solicitation for the JSOW AUR Container effort is anticipated for release in the 3rd quarter of FY08. A Best Value source selection is planned with an anticipated development/qualification contract award in FY09.

The Government's solicitation will require the design, development, integration, test, qualification, and production of a low cost replacement AUR JSOW Container. Additionally, the Government will require the delivery of a Technical Data Package (TDP) and Government Purpose License Rights (GPLR). The Government anticipates this solicitation to result in the award of a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract for the qualification/FAT effort and also four (4) FFP production options beginning as early as FY09.

Objectives:  The JSOW Container performance specification and statement of work are currently under development; however, early draft specifications and other related technical and programmatic documentation are available for your review and comment. This program includes information that has been designated as Distribution D and is only releasable to current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractors. As such, they will not be posted with the RFP. To obtain a copy of these documents, please contact Mr. John Antol at the email address provided below with the name of your company, mailing address, phone number, email address, and current CAGE number.

c) Primary consideration is for a FFP contract for development/qualification and production. A full and open competition is anticipated for this acquisition utilizing the Best Value approach to select the most advantageous offer based on both non-cost/price related factors as well as cost/price factors. The Government anticipates evaluating the offers based on past performance, technical, management, experience, and cost/price related factors. These potential areas of interest are not listed in any order of preference. In addition to comments in regard to the draft statement of work and draft performance requirement, the Government welcomes any comments and recommendations concerning contract type, evaluation criteria, and areas of interest for the future solicitation. Industry input is solicited and will be considered for an effective development/qualification contract incentive program, considering cost, schedule, performance and/or other factors.

d) Any other technical information the company deems necessary to aid the government in making an informed assessment.  

e)  A JSOW Shipping Container Industry Day is being planned to coincide with the draft RFP release in the Lexington Park, MD area. Potential prime contractors and subcontractors are invited to attend. It is requested that you indicate in your submission your interest in attending this Industry Day as well as topics of interest that you would like to be addressed. Indicate how many personnel representing the company you would like to attend the Industry Day.

<DESC>1.	INTRODUCTION
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Credit Risk Management (OCRM) is responsible for overseeing lenders that participate in the 7(a) and 504 SBA loan guaranty programs.  OCRM?s mission is to maximize the efficiency of SBA?s lending programs by effectively managing program credit risk, monitoring lender performance, and enforcing lending program requirements. One of the tools used by OCRM to carry out its mission is the Loan and Lender Monitoring System (L/LMS).  

The purpose of L/LMS is to identify, measure, and manage risk in 7(a) and 504 programs.  It does this specifically by developing predictive ratings that allow SBA to improve the performance of the two programs using risk management principles.  The system analyzes SBA loan data, Dun & Bradstreet business data, and data provided by subcontractors, including consumer credit bureau information and business credit scores.  It uses a commercially available suite of scorecards to produce business credit scores that predict the likelihood of an SBA loan becoming severely delinquent over the next 18 to 24 months.  It also contains trend databases that provide historical data on each loan level.  Part of the L/LMS provides lender risk rating scoring.  It assigns each lender a composite rating based on certain portfolio performance factors.  SBA lenders would have access to their own ratings through SBA's Lender Portal.

2.	OBJECTIVE
As part of SBA?s continued loan portfolio credit risk management and lender oversight efforts, the Agency will obtain credit risk management support and program management support. SBA is seeking to apply credit risk prediction and evaluation to its 7(a) and 504 loan portfolios.  The objective of this Sources Sought Notice is to seek information about small businesses that are capable of providing the services.  Please note that this is a market survey for informational purposes only and is not a Solicitation.  There is no solicitation document available at this time; no contract will be awarded based on this announcement; and no reimbursement will be made for costs associated with responding to this announcement.  All responses must be submitted via e-mail in accordance with the instructions that follow.  
 
3.	REQUIREMENTS
The vendor shall provide a Credit Risk Predictive System consisting of multiple predictive scoring models at the loan level for SBA 7(a) and 504 portfolios to generate validated quarterly credit scores for each SBA 7(a) and 504 active loans and include both commercial and personal credit, to the extent available, within the credit scoring model(s).  The scoring models within the System shall utilize a state-of-the-art, commercially available off-the-shelf product that represents a nationally recognized commercial scoring product using nationwide credit data.  The purpose of having the models is to utilize the credit scores and such portfolio performance variables that, in combination, provide a highly predictive likelihood of purchase (by SBA) on active 7(a) and 504 loans guaranteed by the Agency within a reasonable period of time and to be indicative on each portfolio?s trend development.  
The vendor shall compile the information generated by the Credit Risk Predictive System, including but not limited to credit scores, borrowers? consumer and corporate information together with the SBA mainframe loan information into a data warehouse, maintained and hosted by the vendor.  This data will be accessed by utilizing a front-end software application provided by the vendor.  
The vendor shall provide a Lender Risk Rating System consisting of multiple predictive scoring models.  The System shall assign a rating score, on a scale of 1 to 5 for each SBA lender [consisting of 7(a) participating lenders and 504 Certified Development Companies (CDC)], with an SBA active portfolio, on a quarterly basis.  A rating of 1 would indicate strong portfolio performance, least risk, and the least degree of SBA management oversight needed (relative to other Lenders in their peer group), while a rating of 5 would indicate a weak portfolio performance, highest risk, and therefore, the highest degree of SBA management oversight.
The vendor shall create and host a database called the Lender Information Portal (Portal).  The database will contain SBA participant lenders? portfolio performance ratios, average loan credit scores, cumulative cash flow information, peer group performance, overall portfolio performance, lenders? risk ratings and any additional data as directed by SBA.  The database shall have a user friendly web-based application, available online to participating 7(a), 504 lenders and SBA staff.
The vendor shall conduct the portfolio analysis on the SBA?s 7(a) and 504 programs on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.  The result of the analysis shall be compiled into various reports.
Finally, in addition to the monthly, quarterly, and annual portfolio analysis and reporting, the vendor shall conduct ad hoc analysis and reporting at the request of SBA.

4.	INSTRUCTIONS
Responses to this announcement must provide detailed, concise information about the experience in providing services similar to those described above, within the past five (5) years. Information shall include the contract number, dollar value, period of performance, current status, performance measurements (planned vs. actual) and current Government point of contact information including name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address.

The contractor will be tasked with finding the most effective way of conveying a message in print, electronic and film media using a variety of methods such as color, type, illustration photography animation and various print layout techniques. 

The broad categories of the multi-media services include: a. consultations on design or implementation of any task, b. custom photographic services using digital or film as requested, c. providing  graphic design services ranging from simple line drawings to the most complex graphics, d. video projects from concept development to completion and from production to post production, e. meeting and event support to ensure the needs of planners and presenters are met regarding room setup, audio-visual support, options and associated costs and  f. providing a typed monthly report to the NIEHS  that includes a listing of all completed work orders, and shows final costs. 

Responses to this sources sought will be used by the Government to select an appropriate procurement method to fulfill the requirement above. The contract performance period will be for a base year and four one year option periods and is projected to begin on 01 October 2007. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541430. The business size standard is $6.5 million. Interested candidates should include the following in their response:  a.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 
After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Those companies who do meet the technical/company criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  

For those companies that meet the requirements above and the criteria below under Technical/Company Criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M., fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting.  However, the Government reserves the right to invoke evaluations in an inpatient setting.

2.	The MTFs will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement using a zero to seven rating scale. Zero is equal to not acceptable and seven is equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all products.  All clinical criteria are weighted equally. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 3.75 is a target acceptability threshold.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.75 depending on the "break" in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the 3.75.  Below this threshold, products will be unacceptable clinically and not eligible for consideration for standardization and will not be considered further

3.	After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the
clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil.

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the offers become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important

     The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria with pricing being least important.  A multiple award is a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region.

Technical/Company Criteria:

The CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for the purpose of evaluation of the technical criteria means the responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: (1) the vendor  offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the  vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the product line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community in which such products and/or services are applicable; (3) the vendor has a DAPA for the product line, products and/or services; (4) the vendor has a commercial agreement covering the product line, products and/or services with Owens and Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region ; (5) the vendor intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the  vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

1.	You are required to provide a full line of a full line of reusable staff apparel to include, but not limited to, scrubs (tops and bottoms) and jackets. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.
2.	Your reusable staff apparel products must be available through the regional Prime Vendor, Owens & Minor.
3.	You are required to provide your DAPA Number.
4.	You are required to provide the brands your company manufactures or distributes.

A.	 General Information

The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of Disposable Staff Apparel which must include, but is not limited to, surgical caps, lab coats, coveralls, jumpsuits, and shoe covers. The major facilities in the area includes: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

    The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

     This procurement is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is January 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.    
   
Point of Contact Robert Meinertzhagen, 757-953-2134, Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Mid-Atlantic Region is seeking product line items in the category of Disposable Staff Apparel.  

The approximate annual purchase volume of $55,131 is based upon the historical usage of standardized Disposable Staff Apparel over a one year period.  The overall evaluation will be based upon clinical, technical and pricing factors.  The final award recommendation will be determined by utilizing the best value and trade off criteria.  The Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region is Owens & Minor.  

At the request of the Mid-Atlantic Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of these products, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types, and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Offerors

If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your response to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil and provide: (1) Company name and address, (2) Point of  contact information (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) (3) your company?s Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) number and (4) your companies responses to the questions under Technical/Company Criteria below.  Your email will include your agreement to provide for your products necessary technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers that represent a discount from your companies base uncommitted DAPA pricing.  If required, any postal mailings should be sent to the following address: 

Robert Meinertzhagen
Tri-Service Regional Business Office
Financial Operations Department, Bldg. 250
Naval Medical Center Portsmouth
620 John Paul Jones Circle
Portsmouth, VA  23708

Email responses must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. EST on the closing date of this FBO Notice.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from future participation in this standardization effort.

Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Tri-Service Regional Business Office via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 
After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Those companies who do meet the technical/company criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  

For those companies that meet the requirements above and the criteria below under Technical/Company Criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M., EST fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting.  However, the Government reserves the right to invoke evaluations in an inpatient setting.
2.	CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. Clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement will use a zero (0) to seven (7) rating scale. The scale descriptors are: 0 = not acceptable and 7 = highly acceptable.  All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all products.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.75 depending on the "break" in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the 3.75.  Below this threshold, products will be unacceptable clinically and not eligible for consideration for standardization and will not be considered further.
3.	After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the
clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. EST fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the offers become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important

     The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria with pricing being least important.  A multiple award is a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region.

Technical/Company Criteria:

TRBO personnel and the CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for the purpose of evaluation of the technical criteria means the responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: (1) the vendor, who will be named the quoter, offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the quoter?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the product line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community in which such products and/or services are applicable; (3) the quoter has a DAPA for the product line, products and/or services; (4) the quoter has a commercial agreement covering the product line, products and/or services with Owens and Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region ; (5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the quoter?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

1.	Your company must provide a full line of disposable staff apparel which must include, but is not limited to, surgical caps, lab coats, coveralls, jumpsuits, and shoe covers.  The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.

<DESC>>$10K Competitive Strategy
SUPPORT EQUIPMENT COMMODITY COUNCIL
WR-ALC

The Support Equipment Commodity Council (SECC) located at Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to obtain industry input on the development of this strategy spiral.  This continuing interaction with industry is for the purpose of obtaining direct inputs from industry that will allow continued refinement of the requirement.  Based on the inputs received, the information will be used as a basis for an industry day for development of the proposed acquisition strategy.  An Industry Day is anticipated to be held at Robins AFB in Warner Robins GA in Jan 08.  Further details and specific dates, times, and locations will be posted after industry input to this notice and additional analysis is completed by the SECC.  

The following is the outline of the strategy for which inputs are requested:

The SECC proposes to competitively award contracts to manufacturing sources for items with a Government estimated unit price of >$10K to small business manufacturing sources.  This strategy contemplates buy of items and does not include repair of the identified items.  The items are identified by the 97 FSCs that are supported by the SECC.  (For a list of FSCs supported by the SECC you should contact the industry POC identified herein.)  The preliminary evaluation performed on the items in this category indicate that the initial number of items represent 58% of the items included in the entire analysis.  This number of items represents 44% of the forecasted spend for the current fiscal year.  The estimated amount of this spiral is $56M which covers a 3-year forecast.  There are approximately 300 individual items for manufacture.  The population of items has been reviewed and the SECC proposes multiple manufacturing contracts.  Each proposed contract action will be set-aside for small businesses.  The SECC has developed a potential list of items that may be included in this strategy.  When the list is finalized, each item will have a complete data package included in the final RFP.  The preliminary list of items is included with this notice.  The SECC continues to perform analysis and research information in order to determine if the items are appropriate for this strategy.  Industry is encouraged to review each of the NSNs on this list and make any recommendations that may be appropriate for SECC consideration.  Each contract is expected to be a FFP (Firm-Fixed-Price), ID/IQ (Indefinite Deliver/Indefinite Quantity) type of contract.  A DRAFT copy of a notional Statement of Requirements (SOR) for the effort will be available prior to the announced Industry Day.  A separate source selection will be conducted for the award of each contract.

The SECC requests your input to these specific issues regarding the proposed strategy and anticipates further discussion of these issues at the Industry Day event:

1.	NAICS codes have been proposed by manufacturing group as indicated below.   Are there other NAICS codes that industry believes are more appropriate for these categories or should the categories be further delineated?
	Ground Support:  336413
 
    	Hoists & Slings:  333923
 
    	Maintenance Fixtures:  336413
 
   	Misc Adapters:  336413
 
    	Tools & Tool Kits:  336413

2.	The contractors will be the manufacturer for the items accountable under the individual contracts.   The contractors will be awarded items based on technical evaluation, as stated in the source selection criteria, still to be developed.  Are there specific technical issues that should be considered for the technical groups identified?

3.	We are considering implementing PBL (performance based logistics) metrics, such as:  on-time delivery, cost controls, and quality.   Due to the potential diversity of items identified for each contract, what constraints or risks does Industry believe will negatively impact meeting these objectives?

4.	Issues regarding pricing, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), source selection criteria and evaluation, acquisition schedule, and other issues which affect the strategy (and ultimately the solicitation) will be discussed.  This is an opportunity for industry representatives to interact with the SECC team members to make further recommendations, identify any potential obstacles or risks, and propose recommendations to outstanding issues regarding the actions to be taken.  Please feel free to raise relevant issues and we will make allowances to address them at the Industry Day.
 
5.	Qualification and first article requirements will be essential for a source to qualify to make item(s) that may not have been part of their previous manufacturing capability.  Within other industry standards or commercial applications, what processes or testing requirements have you been evaluated against or demonstrated to in order to establish your ability to manufacture a new item or manufacturing process?  Provide information that may support qualification by similarity of manufacture, process, or product such as modeling or simulation; or standard test results or data.  

Contact Linda Ralston at linda.ralston@robins.af.mil for all inputs and responses to this RFI.  Industry recommendations on agenda topics or issues on the strategy or requirement may also be provided to Linda Ralston at the above email address prior to the Industry Day.  Notification will be posted to FedBizOps and provided directly to all contractors who express interest and request that direct email be sent from the SECC.  The POC for this action is Linda Ralston, 478-222-3775.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), an activity of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), is the Defense Department?s principal buyer of military flags (AF and Army Organizational and JROTC Flags) and metal and embroidered insignias.  Numerous heraldic specifications require rayon as a component in a wide variety of items purchased by DSCP such as organizational flags.  For example, MIL-F-2692H, MIL-F-14648, MIL-DTL-14650, MIL-DTL-11589 and DDD-F-416F covers rayon material for use in all of the Army and Air Force Organizational flags and JROTC flags.

Determinations have been made that rayon yarn/fiber is not currently produced in the United States or its possessions and there is currently a Domestic Non-Availability Determination in effect for Rayon.  DSCP is hereby providing producers of rayon yarn/fiber complying with specification and domestic source and content requirements of the Berry Amendment an opportunity to identify themselves.   In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2241, every component (including all natural and synthetic fibers) must be grown and produced in the United States or its possessions.  If your firm meets this criteria and produces rayon yarn/fiber domestically, please submit your firm?s name and point of contact to DSCP, ATTN:  Cindy Esposito, Contracting Officer, via 215-737-5662 or via email cindy.esposito@dla.mil.  DSCP will also entertain domestically produced substitutes for rayon yarn/fiber.  If your firm manufactures domestic substitutes for rayon yarn/fiber that are capable of meeting specification requirements called for in heraldic items, please submit your company information along with the domestically manufactured substitute component.  You may view the above cited specifications at http://assist.daps.mil using the ?Quick Search? option.

Customer Service and Culture Change Training Initiative - Scope of Work The VA Sierra Nevada Health Care System (VASNHCS) has a main campus located in Reno, Nevada and three Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) located in Auburn, CA, Fallon, Nevada and Minden, Nevada.  The system employs approximately 750 employees.  VASNHCS is seeking a qualified vendor who is a recognized leader in the field of education/training in the area of customer service and culture change in the health care industry.  The selected vendor must have a proven record of results based on the effectiveness of  customer service and organizational culture change training, which would be worthy of recognition at the local, regional or national level e.g. Baldrige Award recipient.  The training is projected to span 20 months and will provide transformational education and training to all levels of the organization.  For training purposes the organization has been divided into 4 levels: "	Level I - Executive Leadership (Director, Associate Director and Chief of Staff and selected support staff) approximately 3-8 people "	Level II - Service Level Leadership (Service Chiefs and Supervisors) approximately 48 "	Level III - Staff approximately 696 "	Level IV - Specialty training for identified groups requiring emphasis training - this number will vary depending on the group but the size of these classes will not exceed 35 participants.  For example, one training group would receive "train the trainer" instruction while another group might require more intense civility training. Training Objective - Create a new organizational culture that fosters civility and focuses on excellence in customer service, performance, accountability and quality.  The training vision is "World Class Care and Service for America's Heroes." Training Sites - Primarily at the VASNHCS, Ioannis A. Lougaris Medical Center, 1000 Locust Street, Reno, Nevada 89502; but also at the Auburn, California - Sierra Foothills CBOC; at the Minden, Nevada - Carson Valley CBOC; and at the Fallon, Nevada - Lahontan Valley CBOC. Level I and II training will be located at the main campus in Reno.  Level III and IV training will be performed at the main campus and at all CBOCs, so as to provide convenient training to all personnel. Training at the main campus medical center will be scheduled in a manner that all three shifts can attend.  Training conducted at the CBOCs will be conducted during normal business hours. Training Duration - 20 month program span to be started in early 2008.  Training sessions are limited to 90 minutes each.   "	Level I will receive 4 trainings sessions geared to successful stewardship of this program.   "	Level II will receive 5-6 training sessions geared to: o	leadership (performance and accountability),  o	customer service,  o	culture change,  o	change management,  o	selecting new employees with the right customer service attitude,  o	leading the change of the status quo, and  o	leading/monitoring/measuring employee and group projects successes.  "	Level III will receive 5-6 trainings geared to: o	understanding leadership expectations for excellent customer service,  o	understanding what is required in order to effect culture change o	embracing VA core values i.e., the meaning of civility, compassion, respect, commitment and excellence, and o	development of small group (not more than 5 participants) "Walk the Walk" project designed directed at improving customer service.  "	Level IV (Leadership will identify groups needing focused specialized training in how to overcome the challenges that will be presented by this education/training proposal) i.e., resistance to culture change.  These groups will receive 2-4 additional trainings and will be limited to 25 participants.  * All trainees will receive a toolbox of best practices and method examples for dealing with customer service and culture change issues.  Training Kick Off - A marketing strategy and communication plan needs to be incorporated into this training program in order to promote the training and to gain wide acceptance and cooperation.  Kick off activities will be planned between the vendor and the organization, which may include a competition for a training motto, awards that meet VA criteria and peer recognition. Training Program - The training program will be based on and emphasize the VA's High Performance Development Model (HPDM can be located at http://vaww.sites.lrn.va.gov/vacatalog/ ), the mission, vision and core values that distinguish the VA.  As background to the current status of the organization in terms of customer service and employee needs, the selected vendor will be provided and will review results of both the Survey of Healthcare Experiences (SHEP) survey and the VA "All Employee Survey" conducted by the National Center for Occupational Development.  These two surveys provide important information and data that identify weakness and strength of the organization.  This information will assist the vendor in developing a successful targeted training approach.   The program will integrate constructs of: excellent customer service (both internal and external); the importance of civility to productivity and accountability within a high performing organization; cultural diversity; effective interpersonal communication techniques; change management and the promotion of change management concepts; a changing organization and how to recognize opportunities and meet challenges; and constructs of thinking out of the box - how to stimulate creativity.  The educational training program will utilize employee owned ideas that will stimulate organizational transformation and elevate the organization into one that provides world class service, accountability and excellence in quality patient care.   Each level of training will be given a "toolbox" of health care industry best practices, examples and the "how to" instructions for sustaining long term excellent customer service and culture change.  For example the toolbox would provide methods for dealing with difficult people, while providing excellent customer service.   Additionally, a "train the trainer" component is to be incorporated into this educational program.  Selected individuals will attend a two session specialized program designed to develop internal trainers that will help the organization going forward to achieve its goal of excellent customer service and sustain its cultural transformation. As a result of this training, the VASNHCS will become a model for other VAs and community partners.  Measurement of success will be measured by the "Walk the Walk" employee projects aimed at providing excellence in customer service and quality patient care.  The project portion of this training will be conducted by individuals or small groups (not more than 5).  Successful individual and group projects (not service level) will be presented across VASNHCS at service level meetings and published to employees.  Highly successful projects will be taken to the Veteran Integrated Service Network (VISN) level (regional level).

<SUBJECT>A -- Control Systems Cyber Security Self-Assessment Tool (CS2SAT)
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY ? Control Systems Cyber Security Self-Assessment Tool (CS2SAT)

Idaho National Laboratory (INL), operated by the Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA) under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to nonexclusively license and commercialize a desktop software tool for improving a facility?s control systems cyber-security posture. INL may also be available to partner(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a partnership agreement.

***Background: 
The Control Systems Cyber Security Self-Assessment Tool (CS2SAT) was developed under the direction of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) by cyber security and control systems experts from the INL.  The DHS/NCSD/CSSP program works to assist asset owners in evaluating the security posture of the control systems used to operate the nation?s critical infrastructure. 

***Description:
The Control Systems Cyber Security Self-Assessment Tool (CS2SAT) provides users with a systematic and repeatable approach for assessing the cyber security posture of their industrial control system networks. CS2SAT is a desktop software tool which guides users through a step-by-step process to collect facility specific control system information and then makes appropriate recommendations for improving the system?s cyber security posture. The tool pulls its recommendations from a database of the best available cyber security practices, which have been adapted specifically for application to industry control system networks and components. Each recommendation is linked to a set of actions that can be applied to remediate specific security vulnerabilities.  The software provides a user-friendly interface for users to systematically retrieve requirements specific to their system network.

***Development Status:
Beta testing of the CS2SAT tool has been completed, and a production version is ready for immediate licensing.  

***Intellectual Property:
INL has asserted copyright in the CS2SAT tool with the approval of the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy. 

***Commercial Opportunity: 
INL has executed a license agreement with one commercialization partner and is seeking additional industry partners to help commercialize the CS2SAT tool.  INL is seeking partners who will promote and support the tool?s widespread use in each of the critical infrastructure sectors.  Ideal commercialization partner(s) would have some or all of the following qualifications:
*  Experience in a control system and/or cyber security related business
*  Demonstrated ability to bring new software tools to the market
*  Resources to make a significant investment in the marketing and support of this tool 
*  Access to an established base of potential users in one or more critical infrastructure sector(s)
*  Substantial United States presence and/or the ability to significantly enhance U.S. industrial competitiveness.

NOTE: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.

Commercialization partners interested in licensing INL's CS2SAT tool should provide a written statement of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than January 31, 2008.  The statement of interest should include the following information:
1.  Company Name and address
2.  The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact
3.  A description of business and technical expertise relevant to commercializing this technology
4.  A description of the entity?s motivation for pursuing this opportunity.

Potential partners deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.

<SUBJECT>C--PROFESSIONAL REMEDIATION SERVICES
<DESC>Professional Engineering Services Required for Developing and Implementing Contamination Assessment and Remediation Requirements for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Sites and Petroleum Contamination for NASA on the John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), Florida   This synopsis specifies the Government?s requirement and is a combined synopsis and solicitation. THERE IS NO SEPARATE SOLICITATION PACKAGE.   This solicitation is NOT a small business set-aside.  The applicable NAICS code is 562910, Remediation Services, which has a small business size standard of $13 million.  In accordance with FAR clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, large businesses will be required to provide subcontracting plans prior to receipt of task order awards expecting to exceed $550,000 and having subcontracting possibilities.  This work will be accomplished as individual task orders under basic ordering agreements (BOAs).  Previous and current RCRA activities indicate there is enough anticipated work so that three contractors can receive a reasonable number of task orders. Accordingly, it is the Government?s intent to award approximately three BOAs with each BOA having an ordering period of five years.	It is anticipated that individual task orders will range from under $100,000 to approximately $2 million and the magnitude of the work to be ordered is estimated to be $2 million - $2.5 million per year per BOA.	Multiple, large site investigations with concurrent performance schedules are anticipated to be purchased under the BOAs. Individual task orders may be awarded beginning with the dates of execution of the BOAs.  Task orders issued against the BOAs prior to their expiration may extend beyond the ordering period of the BOAs.  The task order placement process under the BOAs will take into consideration the firms specialized experience, technical competence, and professional qualifications in the specific task to be ordered; the contractor?s past performance on earlier orders under the BOAs (including quality, timeliness and cost control);  and the contractor?s capacity to accomplish the specific task in the required time.   The Architect-Engineering firms selected will be required to perform tasks which primarily include the preparation and implementation of Solid Waste Management Unit Assessments, Confirmation Sampling Work Plans, Confirmation Sampling investigations and Reports, RCRA Facility Investigations (RFI) with RFI Work Plans and RFI Reports (including human health and ecological risk assessments), Corrective Measures Work Plans and Studies, and Statements of Basis.  Each RFI shall be accomplished in accordance with applicable U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) RCRA and TSCA directives.  The firms shall also prepare Interim or Corrective Measure Work Plans for any required soil and/or groundwater clean up and perform groundwater monitoring and operations and maintenance of installed groundwater clean up systems. The Government will designate the sites to be studied during the ordering period. The firms shall also develop and implement petroleum contamination investigations in accordance with Chapter 62-770, Florida Administrative Code (FAC).  Additional supplemental guidance to Chapter 62-770, issued by FDEP, shall be utilized.  The project tasks will begin with investigations and conclude with the submittal and approval by the FDEP of a Site Assessment Report and/or Remedial Action Plan that determines site disposition. Other professional services to be ordered under the BOAs include, but are not limited to, preparation of specifications, drawings, and cost estimates for interim and/or corrective measures for remediation installation; project management, technical services during the remediation installation, review of shop drawings and other technical submittals; field monitoring, supervision/inspection and evaluation of work; and preparation of record drawings. Work implementing the corrective measures is not included in the scope of this requirement.  The Government will implement these corrective measures through other contract sources.  The firms shall support the agency review and approval process and provide engineering support during the public review and comment periods for RCRA permit modifications.	Final submittals to the Government shall be signed and sealed by Florida registered professional engineers or geologists.   The contractor must have specialized experience and technical competence in the development and implementation of contamination assessment and remediation requirements for RCRA and/or petroleum-contaminated sites, with specific experience in Florida. The selected firms shall have demonstrated knowledge of all applicable governing laws, regulations, codes, standards, specifications, and Federal, state, and local permitting requirements. The professional services ordered require multi-disciplined engineering skills demanding selected firms to be staffed, at a minimum, with engineers demonstrating experience in each of the following disciplines:  civil engineering, chemical engineering, environmental engineering, and geotechnical engineering.  Other required project staff disciplines include geologists, biologists, and engineering technicians capable of manipulating the sampling, geologic, and engineering data through the use of common word processing, database software, etc.  Drilling and laboratory functions may be subcontracted but all drillers shall be licensed in the state of Florida and the analytical laboratories must have a state of Florida-approved Quality Assurance Project Plan. All proposal submittal packages shall include at least one proposed analytical laboratory that has a state of Florida-approved Quality Assurance Project Plan.   KSC, as a mass generator of hazardous waste, is regulated under a RCRA Permit which includes Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) corrective action requirements.  These HSWA corrective action requirements generate the need for KSC to retain firms capable of performing multiple, large site investigations with demanding schedules that include stipulated penalties for failure to meet required dates for submittal of RCRA corrective action documents. (Over sixty-five (65) corrective action documents were submitted to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection for regulatory approval including concurrent submittals of Corrective Measures Studies for two large complex sites during the past fiscal year.)  This requirement is being acquired in accordance with FAR 36.602, Selection of Firms for Architect-Engineer Contracts.  The following evaluation factors, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of submittal packages received in response to this solicitation:  1.

<SUBJECT>70 -- TMS Maintenance
<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority of the test program for commercial items Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.501(a)1(ii),  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This agency intends to award to K&R Custom Software, Inc., 739 Thimble Shoals Blvd. STE 302, Newport News, VA 23606-3562.

1.  The 6th Communication Squadron requires technical maintenance/software support for K&R?s previously installed, maintained, and populated Telephone Management System (TMS).

2.   The award of a contract for TMS technical maintenance/software support must be awarded to K&R Custom Software, Inc. because they engineered the TMS data base currently in use specifically to interface with MacDill AFB MSL-100 Telephone Switch.  Due to proprietary rights and configuration knowledge it would prevent other companies from providing maintenance support and system upgrades unless system replacement takes place.  Current replacement of the system is not cost effective for the government.

3.  Market research was conducted for the purchase of TMS Maintenance and K&R Custom Software, Inc. is the only contractor found able to supply this item as we require. If no response to this notice is received by 3:00pm EST on Tuesday, December 18, 2007, the award for TMS System Maintenance will be made to K&R Custom Software, Inc.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:


Closing date and time for receipt of offers is January 03, 2008, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
                                                    Commandant (G-A)

<DESC>Consolidated questions originally received have been answered below.  Please review:

1. Question:
Please provide clarification as to which types of pest control licenses would be required for the work.  Would mosquito larva and adult mosquitoes be included in this work?

1. Answer:
Please see answer to question 5.

2. Question:
What is the history of termites in the buildings?  Typically termites are only covered in a general contract at a level to provide spot treatment or to vacuum swarming termites indoors.  If a more intensive treatment is indicated a separate cost estimate would be provided above and beyond the contract.  You are requesting a five year warranty on treatment that would expect a complete treatment of the building if termites appear as part of the monthly fee.  Please provide the linear footage you want treated during the initial year and each subsequent year of the contract so that we may provide the proper pricing.

2. Answer:
The training center has had old Outdoor Pistol Range.  This section was a wooden frame structure, now replaced with a block/metal structure with termite treatment prior to building construction as per code requirements.  We require the spot treatment, vacuuming of swarming termites indoors, and scheduled inspections for termites (initial then yearly).  When evidence of infestation is found an amendment to the contract would be drawn up for the cost of the treatment of the effected building.

3. Question:
Likewise wildlife (deer, geese, fox) are generally handled by Wildlife Control Companies.  To what extent would the contractor be expected to deal with these three examples as part of the contract?

3. Answer:
The Pest Control Company will NOT be dealing with deer, geese, or foxes

4. Question:
Ornamental and Turf Pest Control:  What services would be required under in this area?  

4. Answer:
Currently, there is a lawn service contractor which fertilizes the facility and treats the manicured lawns for grubs, Beatles, etc.  The treatment for Ornamental and Turf Pest Control would be for treatment above and beyond what our contracted lawn service deals with. Should we begin experiencing an unusual or excessive number or pests, AND IF the contractor feels the proper way to treat for the problem would be to treat the exterior lawns, we would then pursue these requirements.

5. Question:
What pests other than mosquitoes might be covered in this area?

5. Answer:
Treatment for MOSQUITOES only. We shall secure treatment of the exterior grounds in the near future.

Please Note:
This solicitation are requesting monthly service/PM at the above mentioned buildings with treatment for the mentioned pests at the other buildings on an as needs basis?i.e. if bugs or rats appear in the ammo bunker we will require service there when they are noticed.  

Lastly, services for the mosquitoes/larvae are required on a seasonal basis.

The above is to answer received questions only.  All other terms are still in effect.
