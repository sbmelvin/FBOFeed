<CONTACT>Don Terry, (202)
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration intends to award a single source modification to contract DTFA01-01-C-00008 in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4.1.2 to TRIOS Associates to meet the current and future requirements of the BandWidth Manager (BWM) Network Program. The period of performance is for a base of 1-year; and 2-one year options December 1, 2003 through November 30, 2006. It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to continue to acquire these services from the contractor on a single source basis for the following reasons: Â·   Technical Expertise: For the past five years TRIOS has provided systems engineering support to the FAA BWM Product Team on matters relating to system engineering and maintaining configuration management databases.  Â·   Cost & Schedule: The technical expertise and experience of key resources, test tools, and equipment dedicated to the BWM program under the TRIOS contract has significantly reduced overall program costs and schedule risk.  These vital tasks currently performed by Trios Associates require a thorough understanding of the BWM Promina network, extensive BWM Promina Operations, Maintenance, and Network Management training, and expertise in all FAA telecommunications systems and most National Airspace System (NAS) programs.  No other company has acquired this knowledge and expertise. Therefore, the FAA intends to solicit, negotiate and award a single source contract modification to an existing contract with TRIOS Associates for three years of continued support of the Bandwidth Manager (BWM) network program. The Bandwidth Manager (BWM) network uses a variety of existing and emerging technologies between nodes, including Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Internet Protocol (IP), Novell Protocol (IPX), and Frame Relay. The efforts required in the planned contract include: operating and managing the network, validating and coordinating user requirements, preparing modeling analyses, maintaining Configuration Management (CM) databases, ensuring that the requisite nodes are properly configured, completing cabling and engineering drawings, conducting site surveys, installing hardware, and connecting new users to the network and provide general engineering services to include the AIS/AIS-R transition in support of the BWM program, in three years, the BWM network will be replaced by FTI and this effort will no longer be required.  This announcement is not a request for proposals. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA shall not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this request for information, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any cost incurred by any party responding.

The date of issuance is expected o/a February 18, 2003.  The restructuring of higher education in South Africa is anticipated to have a significant impact on Historically Disadvantaged Institutions (HDIs) throughout the country.  In this regard, the USAID/SA Tertiary Education Linkages Project (TELP) has taken cognizance of the need to enable higher education institutions, particularly HDIs to further the transformation agenda of the South African Government.  As a consequence, TELP II will focus on two critical areas at the HDI institutional level, namely (i) curriculum development and program and qualification design, with Quality Assurance and Promotion as a component; (ii) management and administrative development.  At the national level, the TELP II activity will support the Department of Education (DOE) in the policy development and implementation process, and in providing assistance on HIV/AIDS policy issues in response to DOE priorities. Under the anticipated 3 year contract, the contractor will be expected to provide long and short term level of effort technical assistance to the HDIs to (i) assist these institutions to design programs in accordance with the new academic policy; (ii) develop and implement quality assurance systems; develop and implement quality assurance systems; strengthen the management and administrative capabilities of staff.  The Contractor shall be required to provide support to the Department of Education at the national level in the implementation of policy plans reflected in the National Plan for Higher Education, focusing on ensuring that the transformation agenda of the higher education branch with the Department of Education is realized.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   EPA intends to issue a contract on a noncompetitive basis to Dr. Michael Caprio, Mississippi Statement University, for the development of a simulation program that will model the development of pest resistance to the new plant-incorporated protectant crops.  The model will be based on the "Popgen" simulation program developed by Dr. Caprio.  The requirement is for a robust and flexible predictive model that can simulate the impact of rare resistance events on a spatial scale and will offer a realistic evaluation of the evolution of pest resistance towards crops  expressing one or more Bt toxins.  The simulation model shall be hard-wired for pest biology, and shall have options for user-defined inputs around the properties of the PIP (dose, mode of action), the pest management landscape (i.e., alternate practices, other PIPs etc.), the uncertainties around  the genetics of the resistance (SS RS, and RR fitness, cross-resistance), and the IRM plan itself (e.g., refuge, stack, mosaic, no plan). The predictive model shall include the following features: stochasticity, landscape spatiality,  single and multiple toxins at the same or different dose levels,  significant biotic and abiotic factors affecting the evolution of resistance(such as population dynamics, pest biology, density-dependent mortality, density-independent mortality, mating behavior, larvale and adult movement, immigration), genetics of resistance, initial resistance allele frequency,  dominance, potential fitness costs, impact of cross-resistance, impact of alternate hosts, irrigation (or no irrigation), crop rotation, impact of agronomic practices, impact of alternate control tactics used in conjunction with Bt designed to control the evolution of Bt resistance (e.g., synthetic  insecticides), and impact of various resistance mitigation strategies (e.g., refuge, crop rotation) on the evolution of resistance.  The model will be required to evaluate different scenarios related to grower compliance with and adoption of the technology, and economics of various mitigation  strategies. THIS IS NOT AN RFQ.  NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS SYNOPSIS.  Organizations that feel they can meet EPA's requirements must provide supporting documentation no later than 15 days after publication of this synopsis.

Takovska 2, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia & Montenegro, Phone: +381-11-303-20-30, Fax: +381-11-334-16-35.
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance on achieving conformity with the telecommunications law project in Serbia & Montenegro.

As the monopoly provider of fixed-line services, Telekom Srbija provides local, national long-distance and international voice services; Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN); leased lines; data transmission services; fixed satellite services; and various value-added and telematic services.  Its mobile division, Telekom Srbija Mobile, covers more than 65% of the national territory and has some 1.5 million subscribers, or around 50% of the mobile market.  Telekom Srbija is also the main provider of Internet access and of bandwidth to Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and has plans to become an ISP in its own right. 

An Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) based network known as the Serbian Multiservice Internet Network (SMIN), as well as a Belgrade metro network incorporating DSLAMs is being deployed by Telekom Srbija.  Although Telekom Srbija is attempting to satisfy its business customers with multiple networks and services, Telekom Srbija does not have sufficient market research or a clear sense of what these customers actually want, need, are willing to pay for, at what availability/quality levels, etc.  

Through the proposed technical assistance, the company will be able to serve its business customers with the most demanded services, the best pricing, the right quality of service, etc.  The technical assistance will also provide cost estimates and financing options.  With these recommendations Telekom Srbija will be able to make informed decisions on the correct technology platforms, the scope of technology needed, coverage, sequencing and timing of deployment of business services.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $253,314 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 pm, November 18, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.

Arcuri, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-4777, email: Renee.Arcuri@afrl.af.mil.  The overall technical objectives of this BAA are the use of Artificial Intelligence applications, as well as enhanced or new digital processing hardware and software and to provide:  (1) Dynamic/updatable characterization and correlation databases that use existing multi-source near-real-time collection systems.  Measurable and descriptive emitter characteristics should also be used in the database as well as known specific operating characterization values; (2) Enhanced collection system efficiency; and (3) Improved, labor reducing digital signal processing hardware and software analysis with high-capacity capability technology to offset manning reductions at operational units.  The scope of this effort concerns several areas and covers a broad range of issues, which include, but are not limited to the following:  (1) Target specific characteristics identification/ correlation; (2) Automated collection, signal ID sorting and first level processing; (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing/analysis technology at both the Intermediate Processing Center (IPC) and Scientific and Technical Intelligence (S&TI) levels;   (4) Miniaturization of systems to allow embedding aboard UAV platforms; (5) Advanced knowledge-based processing; and (6) Network centric collection management.  Detailed scope and definition of problems are as follows:  (1) Target characteristic identification/correlation:  Battlefield management depends heavily on electronic Warfare (EW) assets to provide current threat analysis for successful deployment of war-fighting resources.  One area that supports this analysis is target specific operating characterization and equipment/unit correlation which is normally a "brute-force/labor intensive" effort:  (2) Automated collection, signal identification (ID) sorting and first level processing.  Dense/LPI difficult waveform signal environment dictate the need for automated/ reduced manual collection, signal ID and sorting, and first-level signal processing.  This area should also allow for further discrimination or "flagging" of out-of-limits signals, especially threat systems whose measurable values already lend themselves to characterization.  Continual high-resolution sampling of Intermediate Frequency Modulation (IFM), pulse sorting, and deinterleaving processes should be investigated as a means to support flagging and automated efforts; end-to-end system equalization techniques need to be developed for interoperability of data between collection systems.  Signal identification algorithms for next generation target radars.  (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing:  Environment complexity as well as advanced collection hardware technology demands growth in the digital ELINT processing arena.  Efforts should take into consideration current analysis technology available, reduction in processing of routine activity allowing time to be spent on more critical tasks, and how best to insert these solution(s) into existing systems. (4) System miniaturization:  Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding on UAV-type platforms.  Attention to power requirements and payload weight are necessarily essential areas of concern, hence digital receiving and processing systems employing miniaturization techniques are of high interest. (5) Advanced Knowledge-Based Processing Techniques:  Timely and accurate decision support to the warfighter require innovative knowledge-base processing for sensor management, emitter ID, flagging, and SIGINT fusion to include but not limited to techniques for automated knowledge acquisition and knowledge modeling, real-time inferencing, and real-time operating system. (6) Network centric collection management: Networked SIGINT sensors extend the sensor virtual collection space, thus significantly enhancing the potential to collect LPI/difficult waveform signals.

<DESC>The Laser Effects Research Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Directed Energy Directorate (AFRL/DE), Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, is seeking innovative techniques and approaches to research requirements for the High Energy Laser Vulnerability Assessment and Modeling Program (HELVAMP).  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS A PRESOLICITATION/ADVANCE NOTICE ONLY.  THE SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED UNDER BAA 03-DE-04 ON OR ABOUT 30 OCTOBER 2003.  DO NOT SEND PROPOSALS IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
 
The objective of the HELVAMP is to develop and enhance current capabilities to accurately predict the effects of laser energy on materials, subsystems, components, and major weapon systems.  AFRL/DE proposes to develop and/or enhance these capabilities by performing basic research on new effects that could result in lethality enhancements to demonstrate laser effectiveness against countermeasure techniques. In addition, AFRL/DE will research the vulnerability of the aforementioned systems and subsystems and the lethality of real and potential weapons against these systems. Specifically, the Laser Effects Research Branch proposes to support an experimental, analytical, and modeling program to develop new and improved experimental capabilities and analysis techniques which can be used to greater advantage in understanding the following areas:  (1) the phenomenology of laser interaction and the effects of directed energy weapons on space and missile systems/subsystems and components; (2) the underlying physics principles of laser threat environment; (3) extending and/or enhancing existing vulnerability assessment modeling and simulation capabilities for assessing laser effects on military systems and (4) evaluating the effectiveness of new and improved countermeasure techniques of target systems.  The metrics for success will involve scientific advancement and break-throughs in new effects and/or signature generation techniques for destroying targets and for performing damage/degradation assessment, respectively.  Results of these efforts will be documented in AFRL technical reports. 

HELVAMP encompasses Target Failure Mode Analysis and Laser Damage Effects, Target Vulnerability Assessment and Target Folder Development, and High Energy Laser Modeling and Simulation and Special Tests & Studies.  The goal of this effort is to develop novel approaches for determining the susceptibility/vulnerability of missile systems, tactical targets and other target assets to laser environments. We are seeking new approaches in the areas of experimental planning & execution, pre-and post-experiment analysis, and model validation/verification.  The population and maintenance of a unique database management system and target folders for the compilation/cataloging of laser effects on systems, subsystems, and components is desired. The successful offeror shall propose modern and effective methods which improve the understanding of the phenomenology of laser interaction research and  enhance current analytical approaches and experimental techniques.  The successful offeror shall also demonstrate extensive knowledge on the physics of laser interactions and the formulation of vulnerability criteria.  The estimated total program budget for these efforts is approximately $25-49M over six years (FY04: $4-8M; FY05: $4-8M; FY06: $4-8M; FY07: $4-8M; FY08: $4-8M; FY09: $5-9M).  This amount is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the Government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period.  Award to a single offeror is anticipated, however, the government reserves the right to make multiple awards. 

Offerors must address each of the encompassed programs to insure the Contractor Statement of Work (CSOW) submitted is all-inclusive.  Technical Areas are described below.

1. Target Failure Mode Analysis and Laser Damage Effects:  The thrust of this activity is to (1) Develop state-of-the-art modeling methodology for understanding, assessing, and predicting the interaction of lasers on systems with military hardware; (2) Execute experimental research programs on the effects of laser energy on materials, sub-components, components, subsystems, and systems of interest; and (3) Perform research on new effects or concepts to counter countermeasure techniques. This effort includes identifying vulnerability methodologies capable of predicting system failure and a means for performing damage/degradation assessment when irradiated with lasers, demonstrating an understanding of the physics of interactions and identification of all critical components of each of selected systems. The offeror should provide an analysis of each critical component to determine the point or points during mission performance when and where it is most vulnerable and mission essential. The analysis should also include failure induced by weakening/degrading of critical members, catastrophic failures melt-through of multiple components, and failure of mission essential systems. Analyses should concentrate on those aim point/kill mechanisms as designated by approved task orders.

2. Target Vulnerability Assessment and Target Folder Development:  The overall goal of this effort is to enhance our understanding of the physics of interaction, and to identify lethality enhancement techniques and counter-countermeasure techniques for defeating all classes of targets.  The objectives are to (1) Formulate vulnerability criteria for major weapon systems; (2) Assess potential applications and effects of laser concepts for various DoD missions; (3) Perform laser lethality assessments of weapon system capabilities; and (4) Develop and maintain target folders to document results of vulnerability assessments.  This effort shall include laser target vulnerability assessment studies and assessment of the effectiveness of specific weapon concepts against various engagement scenarios and adjunct missions.  This includes threat assessment, interaction, and target response of Nuclear Missile defense class targets. The offeror should provide: (1) Innovative methods and approaches to enhance current vulnerability effects and assessment capabilities; (2) Innovative methods and approaches for the understanding of the physics of interactions of lasers with composite and novel materials, including the lethality assessment against Theater Ballistic Missile systems/subsystems down to the component/subcomponent level; and (3) Identification of lethality enhancement techniques and counter-countermeasure techniques.  
  
3.  High Energy Laser Modeling and Simulation and Special Test & Studies.  The overall goal of this effort is to enhance laser lethality predictions with increased realism and to develop and improve predictive physics models. The objectives are to develop improved modeling and simulation capabilities for laser effects on military systems, and evaluate the effectiveness of new and improved hardening techniques of target systems.  The effort includes modifying existing models where available and appropriate, developing, as required, modeling codes and software to demonstrate a validated predictive capability of the probability of kill for target sets designated by approved task orders.  This effort shall also include laser lethality demonstration to validate the Lethality Assessment models/algorithms.  Offerors should provide innovative methods and approaches to improve our understanding of the laser interaction phenomenology on composite materials in high and low irradiance regimes, and failure mode analysis and laser phenomenology issues of the laser against adjunct threat targets.  

Work in this area shall also provide distinct, specialized products.  These products may include unique diagnostic methods and approaches to testing and analyzing target assets including:  (1) Unique target fabrication; (2) Investigation of ultra-short pulse effects; (3) Target structural response phenomenology: Developing code enhancements; (4) Special diagnostics; (5) Contingency planning; (6) Self-protection concepts; and (7) Other innovative projects.  

GENERAL INFORMATION.
The Government anticipates awarding a single Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee Task Order, completion contract, but reserves the right to award a procurement instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposed.  The contract award is anticipated to be unclassified, and is expected to have a six-year ordering period.  In the event the Government is unable to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror, we reserve the right to conduct negotiations with another offeror.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-PRDA-04-02-IFKA
<CONTACT>Renee Arcuri, Contracting Officer, Phone (315) 330-4777, Fax (315) 330-8094, Email Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil
<DESC>Technical POC/Program Manager, Carolyn Sheaff, AFRL/IFEA, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4114, Phone (315) 330-7147, e-mail: sheaffc@rl.af.mil. Contracting POC: Renee Arcuri, Contracting Officer, AFRL/IFKA, 26 Electronics Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514, Phone (315) 330-4777, e-mail Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil. The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and development for innovative concepts and techniques for Cross-Platform SIGINT Fusion and Correlation. The Air Force Research Laboratory Fusion Technology Branch has developed an open, distributed, object-oriented architecture called the Extensible Data Architecture (XDA) for information fusion under the Adaptive Sensor Fusion (ASF) program. This program included support for multiple interoperable fusion components and a public Application Programmer's Interface (API) that is suitable for inserting new fusion components into the system. Fusion component interoperability is based on a shared description of the battlespace and shared data exchange and persistence mechanisms. Through the implementation of a common interface and a common battlespace ontology, new and legacy fusion engines and capabilities can be encapsulated and become interoperable components within a common architecture. Given this stable environment for test and development, the performance of legacy and new fusion engines can be rapidly inserted, evaluated and consistently quantified.  
The NSA sponsored Advanced Fusion Workstation (AFWS) developed by AFRL is a government owned and extensible information fusion system built upon the XDA/ASF core services.  In it’s present instantiation it is focused on solving the SIGINT fusion problem set.  The extensible nature of the system however, allows it to easily accommodate multiple sensing modalities, and data sources.  One of the major goals of the AFWS is to accommodate inferential reasoning to achieve JDL level II and III fusion.  In the present configuration the system utilizes the K-PASA template based reasoning services of WebTAS.  Ongoing work is incorporating automated reasoners using a Bayesian approach and Demptser Shaefer reasoning capabilities.  The basic premise is to transition from semi, to fully automated inferential reasoning, as the underlying science of the fusion components support such transitions.  
The scope of this announcement is to acquire necessary technologies and their integration into the IFEA Advanced Fusion Workstation XDA-based architecture.  Specific goals and capabilities include but are not limited to: AOI Monitor – Provides an operator defined area of interest, within which he/she can define a set of rules to be applied to multi-INT streaming data.  When the real time state occurs the operator is notified. (JDL Level II).  Inferential Reasoning Component – Component to provide semi-automated JDL level II fusion.  This component will instantiate multiple reasoning methods that include: A) Operators codified knowledge of patterns of activity based upon a-priori knowledge.  As various states of the activity models are satisfied, operators are notified that predetermined activities are likely occurring.  B)  Automated inferential reasoning system that may provide SCI level identification of elements in the battlespace, as well as their interaction with one another.  This level of interaction may allow the system to infer intent of entities. C)  Bayesian based automated inferential reasoning approach to solve more complex entity interrelationships problems in the data (JDL Level II and perhaps III).
MTI and ELINT Fusion – An MTI to ELINT fusion component should combine the precise geo-location characteristics provided by MTI with precise identity provided by ELINT. (JDL Level I).  Emitter Mapping – This service will monitor comms external data and reconstruct C2 and other nodal associations between actors in the battlespace.  The ability to map specific clusters of particular types of comms nodes on the battlefield, will provide the capability to assess force strength, and disposition, as well as potentially identity. (JDL Level I)
Automated Creation of Standard Knowledge Bases – Through extension of existing knowledge bases this component will provide a single and coherent source of a-priori knowledge against which other components can reason.  This service will integrate elements of the EIPB output in XML format.  Standard I/O methods – Leveraging existing gateways to data sources such as TDDS and TDIMF as well as streaming MTI data.
Background Acoustics – Existing background acoustics technology will be integrated into XDA.  Speaker ID – Existing speaker ID technology will be integrated into XDA.  Imagery and ELINT –  Information obtained from available satellite and airborne imagery can be combined with SIGINT information to increase identification accuracy and provide precise target location information needed for targeting. Fusion of SIGINT, IMINT, and other sources is required for hard-to-find targets
Ontology Development – Definition and development of standard SIGINT ontology, extension of visualization ontology, and definition of multi-INT ontologies.  CONOPS Development – A CONOPS document will be developed for Single Platform, Cross Platform, and AOC/DCGS Fusion Systems.  ISR Management – Address the resource management, tasking and re-tasking of multiple, network centric sensors to perform SIGINT correlation and fusion to derive situation assessment in support of military operations.  The overall objective of this PRDA is to develop, integrate, demonstrate and transition system technologies.  This program will employ and exploit existing technologies to provide early demonstrations and potential transitions to operational units. It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a roadmap of continued spiral development. In addition to direct technology developments this program will support other complementary activities including, test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, data collection and management, and a distributed collaborative engineering environment. The developed system will be transitionable to Rivet Joint, Senior Scout, C2C, National Systems, the Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS) and/or as applicable, the Air Force Transformation Center.  The AFRL, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division (AFRL/IFE) is soliciting proposals to develop an open, government owned, Multi-INT fusion capability using ASF/AFWS Core Services Framework. Potential Offerors should have considerable experience and expertise in the following areas:  1)  Insertion of new and legacy fusion components and technologies into the ASF/XDA. 2)  Development of  interfaces, algorithms and databases, coordinate software development and integration of fusion modules; and integrate multiple-sources of sensor and intelligence reports. 3)  Recent operational experience on Rivet Joint, and in the AF DCGS and AF AOC. 4) SIGINT Domain Expertise. 5) ISR Management 6) SEI Level 2 Software Development 7) Risk Management 8) Program Management 9) Multi-INT Scenario Development and Modeling.  The program schedule should contain spiral developments and deliveries.  The fusion system shall be designed to process, fuse and display the following types of information, as a minimum: Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Communications (COMINT), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI), and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT).  The design of the system shall not preclude the potential ingestion of other intelligence data, for example, Video, EO/IR, MSI/HSI, MASINT (seismic, acoustic, magnetic), HUMINT.  Program reviews shall be conducted to track technical, financial and schedule performance and risk.  Capability is sought that can be fully developed and transitioned to operational units as rapidly as possible. Since many applicable technologies exist today, offerors are encouraged to leverage technology from these other programs, as applicable. It is anticipated that offerors will investigate, apply, exploit and modify existing COTS and GOTS technologies.  Deliverables will include technical reports, user's manuals, training manuals and delivery and integration of robust software prototypes into the AFRL ELINT Development Facility.  In addition, the level of maturity must be adequate to transition to the user community by integration and demonstrations into the DCGS and/or as applicable, the Air Force Transformation Center.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Center for Neutron Research, Small Angle Neutron Scattering Group, has a requirement for the manufacture of a rotating Quartz Cell with an Invar Shaft Assembly, in accordance with NIST provided specifications.***NIST uses a Paar Physica UDS 200 Rheometer in conjunction with the SANS series of neutron instrumentation.  The reheometer incorporates a rotating device that is constructed from several interconnecting components.  The performance of the reheometer is related to the alignment of this device/assembly.  Experience has shown that the assembly frequently becomes misaligned during use. The misalignment can occur during the simple task of just cleaning the assembly.  Once misaligned, a labor intensive procedure must be followed to bring the assembly back into alignment.  The root cause for the time consuming process is that the assembly is currently constructed from several parts, and each part can contribute to the misalignment.  By constructing the assembly as one component, the misalignment problem should be eliminated.  Eliminating the misalignment problem will ultimately lower instrument operating costs by not having the repeated expense of frequently aligning this assembly.  The purpose of this procurement is to manufacture an assembly in accordance with NIST specifications.***This procurement is subject to the availability of funds in accordance with FAR 
52.232-18.***
The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), specifications, RFQ amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPS.GOV/ under RFQ number SB1341-04-Q-0005.***The RFP is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about October 21, 2003, and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.***Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract. ***No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Carol.Wood@NIST.Gov.***The period of performance shall be eight (8) weeks from the date of award.***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION.***The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to address tertiary education in South Africa. The date of issuance is expected o/a February 18, 2003.  The restructuring of higher education in South Africa is anticipated to have a significant impact on Historically Disadvantaged Institutions (HDIs) throughout the country.  In this regard, the USAID/SA Tertiary Education Linkages Project (TELP) has taken cognizance of the need to enable higher education institutions, particularly HDIs to further the transformation agenda of the South African Government.  As a consequence, TELP II will focus on two critical areas at the HDI institutional level, namely (i) curriculum development and program and qualification design, with Quality Assurance and Promotion as a component; (ii) management and administrative development.  At the national level, the TELP II activity will support the Department of Education (DOE) in the policy development and implementation process, and in providing assistance on HIV/AIDS policy issues in response to DOE priorities. Under the anticipated 3 year contract, the contractor will be expected to provide long and short term level of effort technical assistance to the HDIs to (i) assist these institutions to design programs in accordance with the new academic policy; (ii) develop and implement quality assurance systems; develop and implement quality assurance systems; strengthen the management and administrative capabilities of staff.  The Contractor shall be required to provide support to the Department of Education at the national level in the implementation of policy plans reflected in the National Plan for Higher Education, focusing on ensuring that the transformation agenda of the higher education branch with the Department of Education is realized. The Contractor will provide technical assistance on HIV/AIDS policy issues to the DOE.  USAID anticipates awarding one 3 year cost plus fixed fee term type contract using full and open competition.  Offers are encourage from small businesses and minority serving institutions.

<DESC>THE CLOSING DATE REMAINS UNCHANGED.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: 1. Reference page 1.b. of Proposal Instructions.  The Instructions include the following language.  "Please note that there are no provisions for acceptance of late offers sent by overnight courier service (except by U.S. Postal Service Mail), regardless of the date of mailing."  We assume that DOT will accept overnight courier deliveries of the proposal made if received on or prior to the proposal due date.  Is this correct?  If so, should we consider this to be 12 hours of interpreters on site on Mondays?  This same question would be applicable to the other days of the week. The Government will except any timely proposal from whichever mail courier the offeror selects.  The government does not understand the second portion of the question and therefore can not respond. 2. Reference page 5 of the solicitation, Description of Policies with Regard to Cancellation of Service or Requests for Additional on Call Interpreters.  Is the offeror to include responses to these requests for policies in the proposal or is this to be provided after contract award?  If it is to be included in the proposal, in which volume should the responses be included?  If this is to be included in the Technical Volume, do the responses count against the 10-page maximum page limit?  Because the questions request cost information, we assume that the responses would be included in the Cost/Price volume. If the offeror has a Cancellation Policy they should include it in their proposal. They do not have to have a policy but there will be times when cancellations will occur and we will not want to pay for services we don't received.  If they have an hourly limit prior to services be delivered, they should state it.  Policy itself should be addressed in the Technical Proposal and will not included against the 10 page limit.  3. Reference Synopsis and Ordering Section of the SOW.  The Synopsis states that the anticipated contract is a firm-fixed-price contract.  The Ordering Section of the SOW states that the government will only pay for hours ordered - this sounds like the Government requests a Time and Materials Basis.  Please clarify how the offeror should provide its pricing information. The Government intents to award a firm-fixed price IDIQ contract.  The hourly rate will be fixed based on the proposed rates and the number of hours worked will be indefinite until some point in time.  The fixed loaded hourly rates should be based on the estimated hours as stated in Section B.  4. Reference Proposal Instructions.  It is stated that the offeror should submit One (1) original and one (1) copy of its proposal.  The number of copies requested for the Technical volume is not stated.  Please clarify the number of original and reproduced copies that are requested of this volume. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the entire proposal which includes a technical volume and a price volume is required. 5. Reference SOW page 2, Item 3. The SOW indicates that the contractor should "Provide one additional on-site interpreter, who will be designated by the Contractor as the on-site Interpreter Coordinator.  Is this position in addition to the time indicated in the schedule included in Item 2 on page 2?  For example, on Monday 1 interpreter is required for 6 hours.  Would the  Interpreter Coordinator also be on site for this 6 hour period? Yes, it is in addition to the on-call interpreters. 6. Reference SOW page 2 and Proposal Instructions page 4.  Please clarify the expectations of time for the interpreter and Interpreter Coordinator.  Based on the table of Core Interpreters on page 2 of the SOW, 75 hours per week would be expected for the Core Team of interpreters.  Based on the role of the Interpreting Coordinator, 40 hours per week would be expected.  On an annual basis, this equates to 5,980 hours.  The Pricing Information page (page 4 of the Proposal Instructions indicates 3 categories of service and estimated hours as follows:  0001 - 2,008 hours, 0002 - 3,846 hours and 0003 - 416 hours.  Please confirm that 0001 is for the Interpreting Coordinator and 0002 are for the Primary Interpreters.  Please confirm also that the 0003 code is for on call time for interpreters.  Confirmed.  7. Reference Proposal Instructions page 6, topic Ordering. This section contains the following sentence: The Government will only pay for the hours ordered, subject o the parameters for cancellation charges identified in the contract. This sounds like a time and materials contract rather than Firm Fixed Price.  Please clarify the nature of the contract. See response to Question 3 above . 8. Reference Proposal Instruction page 1, section c. This section suggests that the proposals include Tab indices.  The instructions also require that the proposals be printed on both sides of the paper.  With a maximum limit of 10 pages for the Technical Proposal Volume, it would seem that the use of Tabs would be difficult to satisfy the page limit.  Please confirm how the Government wishes the proposals to be packaging in regard to double-sided printing and the use of Tabs. The tabs pages are not included in the 10 page limit.  The Government's requirement as stated in Proposal Instruction, Volume 1-Technical Proposal , Section C is unchanged.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.  Who is the incumbent vendor?  Signing Hands
2.  What is the reason for the proposal? Was the original contract ending,or was their a performance problem on the contract resulting in a new solicitation?  Original contract ended.
3.  Statement of Work #1.e.  What type of background check will be conducted on the proposed interpreters?  What level of US Government Security Clearance may be required? Is the possession of a Security Clearance a requirement for this proposal?  Or will the Department of Transportation, clear personnel as needed?   DOT requires all contractors to complete Standard Form 85P "Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions" to obtain an identification badge.   DOT will clear additional personnel as needed.
4.  Statement of Work #2.   How often do the start and end times vary for the "core" schedule?  Is this information provided weekly? The start and ending times vary based on the need for services. We try for weekly but the information is more daily.
5.  Statement of Work #3.   Is the Interpreter Coordinator expected to provide interpreting coverage for ad-hoc requests or are they to be dedicated to administrative functions? The Coordinator is expected to provide interpreting on an ad-hoc requests.
6.  Statement of Work #6.  How often has the current vendor been able to meet the standard of providing additional services within 3 hours of the request?  I would estimate 90+% of the time.

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) FI5730008T6, U.S. AIR FORCE (AF) MENTOR-PROTEGE PROGRAM FOR THE AIR FORCE MENTOR-PROTEGE CENTER OF EXCELLENCE 311th HUMAN SYSTEMS WING SMALL BUSINESS OFFICE (HSW/BC). 

POC:  Clifford Trowbridge, (210) 472-5042: mailto:clifford.trowbridge@gsa.gov or Karen Beyer, (210) 472-5040: karen.beyer@gsa.gov.

All questions must be submitted in writing to Clifford Trowbridge or Karen Beyer.

A. INTRODUCTION: 

The Government intends to fund Mentor-Protege agreements by issuing contracts over three separate award cycles. The schedule for Round I is as follows:  Round I Proposals must be received no later than 14 February 2003, 3:00 PM, Central Time, in order to be considered for the initial round of awards. The initial award cycle will follow on or about 15 April 2003. The schedule for Rounds II and III will be posted at a later date.  This BAA announcement will remain in effect until 15 Oct 03.  For additional Air Force Mentor-Protege Program Information, visit http://www.brooks.af.mil/HSW/BC/MP .

Proposals submitted in response to this announcement shall be submitted through the GSA web based Information Technology Solutions Shop (ITSS).  Contractors are responsible for registering with ITSS.  (http://it-solutions.gsa.gov)

The Government has reserved limited funding for 10 awards under an AF initiative restricted to teams proposing proteges who are start-up Native American Owned and/or Women Owned Businesses. 

B. OBJECTIVE:  The purpose of this DoD program is to incentivize DoD contractors to assist small disadvantaged business (SDBs) in enhancing their capabilities to satisfy DoD and other contract and subcontract requirements, and to increase the overall participation of SDBs in the DoD market place. The objective is to help foster the relationship between the two parties to increase the industrial supplier base and enable SDB transition from sub- to prime contractors. An additional intent is to increase subcontract opportunities under the Mentor's contracts, DoD contracts, other government agency contracts, and commercial contracts.

Under this program, companies approved as mentor firms will enter into mentor-protege agreements with eligible SDBs to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance their protege capabilities in the technology areas listed in this BAA under Section D. The anticipated developmental assistance areas shall include: technology transfer, engineering and technical matters such as production, inventory control, quality assurance, and any other assistance designed to develop the capabilities of the protege firm under the development program. A complete description of the program and eligibility requirements are provided in Appendix I of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).






C. APPROACH: The Government intends to use a competitive Two Tiered approach under this announcement.

TWO-TIERED COMPETITION

The Two-Tiered initiative applies to teams proposing proteges who are start-up Native American Owned and/or Women Owned Businesses. The AF envisions these Protege(s) shall qualify within half the size standards of the stated NAICS in Section D. The mentor and protege firm shall agree upon a proposed technology (IAW Section D of this announcement) and outline their approach to Tier One activities in a 10-page White Paper. This White Paper will serve as the proposal for teams wishing to participate in the Two-Tiered approach. During Tier One the HBCU/MI shall evaluate the protegees business needs, conduct market research, and produce a business plan to position the Protege to accept the future transfer of the agreed upon technology. During Tier One the Business Plan will be completed and a program review conducted. Teams progressing into Tier Two will be down-selected based on program review analyses. The AF will request an expanded White Paper from those teams demonstrating progress and achievement of the stated goals during Tier One. Tier Two will focus on implementing technology transfer and business infrastructure improvements identified during Tier One. The expanded White Paper will serve as the Tier Two Program Plan and must include a detailed schedule, program goals and expected posture at the end of the program.  Award dates under this initiative may differ from the full and open competition. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

	The GSA intends to award contracts with eligible mentors in accordance with the DoD Mentor-Protege Program. The period of performance for the Two-Tiered contract will be six months from date of award for Tier One and 18 months for Tier Two. Offerors shall provide proposed costs and supporting documentation for the 6-month period of performance only.

The Two-Tiered proposals must demonstrate team compatibility and established mutual goals prior to submittal. The Tier One efforts will comprise an in-depth business needs evaluation, market research, and result in a Business Plan to position the Protege to accept the future transfer of more advanced technology. Tier One activities shall focus on preparing the Protege to accept a specific technology, within the identified thrust areas, to be transferred during tier two. 

PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS

The contractor shall provide an original and 4 copies. All volumes of the proposal must be in a 3-ring binder, for a total of five binders. Proposal format shall be single sided 8 1/2 X 11 pages, 12-point font with (1) one inch margins, two columns.

All questions must be submitted in writing to Clifford Trowbridge or Karen Beyer.

A. INTRODUCTION: 

The Government intends to fund Mentor-Protege agreements by issuing contracts over three separate award cycles. The schedule for Round I is as follows:  Round I Proposals must be received no later than 14 February 2003, 3:00 PM, Central Time, in order to be considered for the initial round of awards. The initial award cycle will follow on or about 15 April 2003. The schedule for Rounds II and III will be posted at a later date.  This BAA announcement will remain in effect until 15 Oct 03.  For additional Air Force Mentor-Protege Program Information, visit http://www.brooks.af.mil/HSW/BC/MP .

Proposals submitted in response to this announcement shall be submitted through the GSA web based Information Technology Solutions Shop (ITSS).  Contractors are responsible for registering with ITSS.  (http://it-solutions.gsa.gov)

The Government has reserved limited funding for 10 awards under an AF initiative restricted to teams proposing proteges who are start-up Native American Owned and/or Women Owned Businesses. 

B. OBJECTIVE:  The purpose of this DoD program is to incentivize DoD contractors to assist small disadvantaged business (SDBs) in enhancing their capabilities to satisfy DoD and other contract and subcontract requirements, and to increase the overall participation of SDBs in the DoD market place. The objective is to help foster the relationship between the two parties to increase the industrial supplier base and enable SDB transition from sub- to prime contractors. An additional intent is to increase subcontract opportunities under the Mentor's contracts, DoD contracts, other government agency contracts, and commercial contracts.

Under this program, companies approved as mentor firms will enter into mentor-protege agreements with eligible SDBs to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance their protege capabilities in the technology areas listed in this BAA under Section D. The anticipated developmental assistance areas shall include: technology transfer, engineering and technical matters such as production, inventory control, quality assurance, and any other assistance designed to develop the capabilities of the protege firm under the development program. A complete description of the program and eligibility requirements are provided in Appendix I of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).






C. APPROACH: The Government intends to use a competitive Two Tiered approach under this announcement.

TWO-TIERED COMPETITION

The Two-Tiered initiative applies to teams proposing proteges who are start-up Native American Owned and/or Women Owned Businesses. The AF envisions these Protege(s) shall qualify within half the size standards of the stated NAICS in Section D. The mentor and protege firm shall agree upon a proposed technology (IAW Section D of this announcement) and outline their approach to Tier One activities in a 10-page White Paper. This White Paper will serve as the proposal for teams wishing to participate in the Two-Tiered approach. During Tier One the HBCU/MI shall evaluate the protegees business needs, conduct market research, and produce a business plan to position the Protege to accept the future transfer of the agreed upon technology. During Tier One the Business Plan will be completed and a program review conducted. Teams progressing into Tier Two will be down-selected based on program review analyses. The AF will request an expanded White Paper from those teams demonstrating progress and achievement of the stated goals during Tier One. Tier Two will focus on implementing technology transfer and business infrastructure improvements identified during Tier One. The expanded White Paper will serve as the Tier Two Program Plan and must include a detailed schedule, program goals and expected posture at the end of the program.  Award dates under this initiative may differ from the full and open competition. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

	The GSA intends to award contracts with eligible mentors in accordance with the DoD Mentor-Protege Program. The period of performance for the Two-Tiered contract will be six months from date of award for Tier One and 18 months for Tier Two. Offerors shall provide proposed costs and supporting documentation for the 6-month period of performance only.

The Two-Tiered proposals must demonstrate team compatibility and established mutual goals prior to submittal. The Tier One efforts will comprise an in-depth business needs evaluation, market research, and result in a Business Plan to position the Protege to accept the future transfer of more advanced technology. Tier One activities shall focus on preparing the Protege to accept a specific technology, within the identified thrust areas, to be transferred during tier two.

The vacuum hose is light weight 2" x 15' not 1.5" x 15' as specified.  All other information remains unchanged.  Additional information is hereby provided:  The application of the HEPA vacuum for our mission is two fold.  (1) Lead abatement issues concerning the removal of lead dust build-up on our indoor range facility and (2) the second requirement is for range cleaning of the ranges on a daily basis. The vacuum will be required to trap and self contain lead dust particles for disposal through our hazardous waste disposal process.  This is a mandatory requirement. It will also need to vacuum the range floors/walls/ceilings to remove dirt and dust. The vacuum will be utilized in a shooting range environment where unburnt gun powder will exist. This gun powder is highly flammable and is subject to a flash over ignition. The machine will be required to be certified explosion proof for gun powder. The power restrictions on the indoor range facility is 125 volt 20 amps available. The machine will be required to work 24/7 to accommodate our training schedule. We will be requiring a dry vac only. The range debris will consist of not only unburnt gun powder but small bullet fragments, shotgun filler particles as well as everyday dirt and debris from shoes and a high volume student training environment.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Division of Healthcare Emergency Preparedness is seeking organizations with the capability (along with recommended approaches) to:(1) providing a model for an electronic database system usable by multiple parties to interface and provide linkages between the states resulting in a network and (2) providing technical assistance to State, Municipality, and Territory HRSA National Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Cooperative agreement grantees in the implementation of their own operational system based on this model. Preferably, this model should be established through identification, adaptation and or refinement of commercial off the shelf systems and will require partnering with governmental and non-governmental stakeholders to facilitate a total solution approach.

Background 

The experiences of New York City hospitals in the aftermath of the World Trade Center destruction were instructive about the issues confronting the use of credentialed health care professionals in an emergency or mass casualty event. According to reports, hospital and medical personnel involved in the World Trade Center tragedy reported in interviews that they were not comfortable using medical volunteers when they were not able to verify their credentials. Identified barriers to volunteer use included:
 
·	Inability to verify physician's identity or basic licensing or credentialing information 
·	Loss of telecommunications precluding  hospitals from contacting sources that could have provided some credentialing or privileging information 
·	Limitations of resources to perform verification of the education, skills, training, or competencies of volunteers due to the extent of the emergency 

Validation and verification of a healthcare professional’s ability to provide certain medical services traditionally is done through review of licensure and the process of credentialing.  Licensing, credentialing, accreditation, and privileging practices are performed at a local level and are done in a variety of ways. Jurisdiction over granting healthcare provider licenses resides at the state level. Individual health plans and provider organizations perform credentialing and license verifications; hospitals grant privileges to conduct patient care services and specialty organizations and governmental bodies grant certifications to different types of healthcare professionals. This results in different standards and a variety of processes for credentialing and assurance of licensure. Many of these processes are performed locally and healthcare institutions and States place restrictions against using healthcare personnel who have not previously been screened by them and found to meet their local requirements. These issues are problematic because in an emergency or mass casualty event, it is likely that the services of medical personnel from several jurisdictions in the surrounding area will be required, emphasizing the need to have a system that will support effective and efficient identification of qualified volunteer healthcare personnel.


Several federal, state, community, and private sector entities are currently working on identifying ways to identify emergency workers. These include:

·	Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness
o	Office of State and Local Preparedness
·	Health Resources and Services Administration
o	Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program
o	Division of Practitioner Data Banks
·	Office of the Surgeon General/USA Freedom Corps
o	Medical Reserve Corps Program
·	National Institute of Standards and Technology
o	National Institute of Standards and Technology
·	The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
·	American Hospital Association
·	Federation of State Medical Boards
·	American Board of Medical Specialties
·	National Council of State Boards of Nursing
	
To date there is neither an integrated system that can be accessed containing relevant, verified information about a practitioner's education, license(s) and competencies, nor a widely available model template that can be made available to the States to facilitate this type of integrated model.
 
Purpose and Approach

This proposed project will establish a model that will be referred to as the “Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Healthcare Personnel (ESAR-VHP).” This model will be used to establish a network that will serve to enhance the ability of the healthcare system to respond in the event of an emergency or mass casualty event by facilitating a coordinated and uniform method of identifying volunteer healthcare personnel. Initial efforts and pilot testing should be focused on physicians, registered nurses and licensed mental health providers. 

Partnering with governmental and non-governmental entities is critical to the success of this project because both sectors have significant subject matter expertise and experience in creating and maintaining large databases of information that will be relevant to an advanced registration system. 

System Requirements

Discussions for the establishment of a system for advance registration of healthcare personnel were initiated in May of 2002. Subsequent meetings included representation from a wide range of public and private organizations and resulted in the development of draft plans for a disaster credentials data bank.


HRSA was asked to lead the efforts in establishing the model for the ESAR-VHP system. The system requirements that were identified in the draft plans were developed by a public and private working group for a disaster credentials data bank. These requirements have been reviewed, identified as critical, and adopted (with slight revisions) for use in this project.  They are:

System Capabilities

1.	The advance registration system should be open to, and inclusive of, a broad range of health professionals (beyond nurses and physicians) and other skilled personnel for disaster mitigation and response.

2.	The system should capture and maintain information regarding licensure, medical privileges, education, training and special competencies for dealing with disasters.

3.	The captured information should be standardized to the extent possible in order to make it useful, recognizing that there may be different requirements for different types of response teams.

4.	The content of the information maintained in the system, including the possibility of new types of competency information, should be determined by experts in both the public and private sector, with significant input from the health professions and from the potential users of the system.

5.	The system should be able to support multiple use that can interface and provide linkages between the states providing a network.

6.	The system should be designed for interoperability that will support both National and local response needs. It must be able to optimize collaboration and coordination of volunteers among agencies; among communities; and between government and private sector allied interests.

7.	The system should be searchable (e.g. by specific provider competencies and physical locations relative to the need), which will assist in modeling and scenario planning in advance of disasters.

8.	The database should be created and administered in close partnership with the federal and the private sector.

System Operations

1.	The system should have standards for the verification and periodic updating of the information. 

2.	The system should support rapid, accurate retrieval of the information "on&#64979;site" of a disaster with a backup plan in the event the primary system is inoperable.

3.	The system should be able to assist in the authentification of volunteers through such means as biometric or by other, lower cost options such as security codes. 

4.	The system should meet standards for authorized use, security and confidentiality that provide an acceptable comfort level to both volunteers and users of the system.

Information technology

1.	The system should be built with an open architecture and common platform that relies upon the Internet and on existing databases (e.g., those held by states, physician and medical specialty groups) and sources of medical and health professional information.

2.	The system should not depend solely on working telecommunications capacity. The back&#64979;up utility to the system (particularly for information being retrieved at the site of a disaster) should utilize technology (like the smartcard) that meets national interoperability standards.

3.	The information technology (IT) infrastructure should support file segmentation where necessary to accommodate the preferences of volunteers and to assure the security of proprietary databases. 

Critical stages in project development:

1.	Project Plan with identifiable milestones to include: establishment of system requirements, identification of data and verification requirements, identification of acceptable verification sources, policy issues, operational issues, etc.

2.	Delivery of a preliminary functional ESAR-VHP model with incorporation of the basic requirements and a Project Plan for “Pilot Testing.”

3.	Pilot Testing and refinement of the ESAR-VHP model

4.	Delivery of an effective functional operational ESAR-VHP model
Project Plan for providing technical assistance to State, Municipality and Territory grantees to facilitate network development and national implementation. The performance period for this contract is (1) one year from the date that the contract is awarded with the possibility of additional years of renewal based on evaluation and agency need.

4. POSITION TITLE: Private Sector Advisor – USAID/Kosovo
5. MARKET VALUE: $72,381.00 - $94,098.00 per annum (GS 14 – equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: January 2004 –   January  2005
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

   A. Basic Function of the position: 

Based in Pristina, the PSC Private Sector Advisor will be assigned to the USAID Economic Restructuring Office and will be responsible for development and oversight of economic growth policies and projects related to the development of productive enterprises.  Stimulation of productive enterprises is critical to the achievement of USAID objectives in Kosovo.  These programs command a significant share of development resources allocated to USAID programs and include sizeable teams of technical assistance.  

The PSC Private Sector Advisor will report to senior management in Pristina, via the Director of the Economic Restructuring Office, on technical and policy matters related to development of productive enterprises as well as on program management and coordination issues.  The Private Sector Advisor will be responsible for oversight of activities and processes related to the planning, design and implementation of programs related to stimulation of productive enterprises, which may include but is not limited to: investment, trade development, competitiveness and/or employment generation.  The initial period of service is one year, with the possibility of extension for a second year based on mutual consent.

As one of the Mission’s senior-level advisors on productive enterprises development, the Private Sector Advisor will exercise significant independent judgment on matters of policy and technical direction, and will make decisions that ensure successful program implementation.  He/she will report frequently to senior Mission management and will advise senior-level U. S. Office Pristina, donor and host government officials on economic policy, institutional reform and USAID support strategy, program priorities and program directions.

I.  Background

Since the end of the conflict in 1999, the political administration in Kosovo has been represented by the U.N. Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).  The Constitutional Framework, established in 2001, provides for a division of political and economic decision-making authority between the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG), which represent the elected Government of Kosovo and those institutions which report to the Office of the Special Representative to the Secretary General (SRSG).  In the economic sphere, decision-making authority in areas of trade and investment, fiscal policy and administration, and commercial law are generally considered transferred powers.  The areas of privatization, public enterprise management, utilities regulation (other than telecommunications), and banking regulation, are generally under the direct control of the SRSG wing of UNMIK.  

Over the last four years, Kosovo has had to recover from a significant reduction in living standards and employment opportunities associated with two distinct phenomena.  First, the NATO conflict in 1999 and associated paramilitary violence caused significant infrastructure damage, particularly in the telecommunications and housing sectors.  It resulted in massive refugee flows, which completely disrupted economic livelihood activities.  The most urgent impact of the conflict was felt in the agricultural sector, which contributed approximately one-third of GDP and over one-half of total employment.

Second, for the decade before the conflict, Kosovo was subject to a network of discriminatory laws and essentially neo-colonial economic policies by Serbia.  Under this system Kosovar Albanians were dismissed in mass from state jobs in both the public administration and state industry spheres.  Large numbers of housing units were turned over to Serbs, with resulting displacement of the prior Albanian residents.  The provision of public services became virtually exclusively geared toward the needs of the minority.

Thus, economic restructuring in Kosovo faces many challenges.  Nevertheless, since 1999, economic recovery and expansion has proceeded rapidly in Kosovo.  USAID’s Economic Restructuring Office developed a post crisis strategy that included creating a market-driven economy.  USAID’s Economic Restructuring Office has placed considerable resources into accelerating the growth of the private sector through activities working with Kosovar businesses.  However, while overall progress in this area has been considerable, the private sector is not yet driving job creation and Kosovo continues to experience high levels of unemployment and underemployment.
Many of Kosovo’s enterprises are small traders geared toward servicing the international donor community and are not positioned to aggressively pursue export opportunities.  The great need in the private sector is to help Kosovo develop competitive industries producing goods that are marketable domestically as well as regionally.  This, in turn, will result in increased employment.  However, building competitive industries still faces many challenges.
Local agriculture and manufacturing enterprises have not attained production or industry standards that are acceptable for exporting goods to developed economies, or to substitute their goods for an enormous volume of imports.  A dearth of advanced technology, fueled by insufficient credit for capital assets, contributes to this circumstance.  There is a widespread lack of essential business skills such as strategic planning, financial analysis, and organizational and operational management.  Kosovar managers and entrepreneurs often do not have access to market information, industry trends or buyer and supplier networks that are vital to creating and managing competitive businesses. 
Kosovo is not well-integrated into trade regimes.  Kosovo is not included in free trade arrangements recently concluded between Serbia and Montenegro and countries in the region.  Further, Kosovo continues to face discriminatory trade practices from neighboring countries.  Since trade integration is integral to Kosovo’s economic growth, a main focus of future assistance will be facilitating this integration.  Improvements in the trade regime may involve making Kosovo’s laws WTO-compliant and working with institutions to improve trade relations.  Essential elements in stimulating business and agribusiness in Kosovo will be efforts to expand Kosovo’s economic space and create or reestablish vibrant trade relationships and export opportunities.

Effective professional and trade associations are still in their infancy and are not yet strong advocates for the private sector.  Advocacy organizations, self-regulatory organizations, and other professional associations must be further developed in order to encourage and strengthen public-private dialogue and policy debates in order to promote a supportive enabling environment for investment.  Increasing their capacity will be essential if the business operating environment is expected to reflect sound commercial principals and facilitate increased investment and efficient operations.  

Access to credit is restricted, often because of a perceived high level of market risk and even short-term credit to finance purchases of inventory and raw materials requires high collateral.  In addition, although banks are liquid, long-term finance for capital assets is almost non-existent.  This is driven by such factors as short credit histories among local enterprises, weak rule of law, informal employment arrangements, and a lack of experience among banks in collecting on securitized collateral.  This is exacerbated by the inability of most enterprises to independently produce coherent business plans, market research, financial forecasts, and other analysis required by potential lenders.

The agricultural sector, which contributes roughly one-third of GDP, is one of Kosovo’s main employers and thus cannot be ignored in efforts to increase private sector growth.  Initiatives designed to increase competitiveness in agribusiness industries must address several major needs and facilitate not only increased production, but also enhanced product quality, improved processing, efficient use of resources, and expanded market opportunities.  Gains in agricultural efficiency will also lead to increased import substitution and create internal pressure for improvements in the trade regime to exploit export opportunities.  Significant improvements in agricultural efficiency will also require more appropriate credit structures.  
Overall Objective: Based in Pristina, the Private Sector Advisor will be assigned to the USAID Economic Restructuring Office and will be responsible for development and oversight of economic growth policies and projects related to the development of productive enterprises through trade promotion, investment and competitiveness, for all USAID programs, and for related programs/projects within the Economic Restructuring Office. Economic growth policies and programs are critical to the achievement of USAID’s objectives in Kosovo. These programs command a significant share of development resources of all USAID programs, and include sizeable teams of technical assistance.   
 
S/he will report to senior management in Pristina via the Director of the Economic Restructuring Office on technical and policy matters related to SME development, trade and competitiveness, and on program management and coordination issues.  The Program Manager will be responsible for oversight of activities and processes related to the planning, design, and implementation of economic growth-related programs.

5. MARKET VALUE: $ 85,140.00 - $ 110,682.00 per annum  (GS 15 – equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: January 2004 –   January 2006
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

A. Basic Function of the position: 

The 1980s marked a watershed in recent Kosovo history.  During the 80s and early 90s, Serbia, the dominating “partner” in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, systematically began to exclude ethnic Albanians from positions of employment in the public and private sectors in the province of Kosovo as well as from access to services once available to them.  This systematic exclusionary policy, in Kosovo often referred to as apartheid, led to conflict between the Albanian population in Kosovo and the Serbian administrators and police.  The heavy-handed and eventually bloody attempts of the Serbs to put down the Albanian Kosovar rebellion ultimately led to the bombing campaign of NATO in 1999 that caused the withdrawal of Serbian authority and the establishment of UN administration (through UNMIK) over the province.

Support for the development of democracy and governance (DG) is a key element of accomplishing USAID’s strategic objectives in Kosovo.  USAID’s new five-year strategic plan for Kosovo includes two DG strategic objectives (SOs): SO 2.1, Civil Society and Government are more Effective Partners in Achieving Good Governance, and  SO 2.2, More Open and Responsive Government Acting According to the Rule of Law.  
USAID assistance in support of these SOs has taken a number of forms.  USAID has granted funds to the National Democratic Institute with the aim of developing Kosovar political parties and strengthening the newly elected Assembly of Kosovo.  The International Research and Exchange Board (IREX) implements the Kosovo Independent Media Program (KIMP) with the aim of increasing the quality of journalism, strengthening supporting institutions (journalists and broadcasters associations), improving the legal and regulatory framework, and running media outlets as effective businesses.  IREX played a key role in starting Kosovo’s two private television stations, creating the terrestrial broadcast network, and advising OSCE and UNMIK on media law and regulations.  Through a grant to East West Management Institute (EWMI), USAID is focusing its civil society efforts on strengthening the ability of the NGO community to play a more active and effective role in advocating on a wide range of issues.  Other aspects of USAID’s civil society program in Kosovo include women’s leadership development through STAR/World Learning, a women’s internship program implemented by the National Albanian American Committee.  USAID has awarded a contract to the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) to implement a justice system reform strategy program to support court administration reform, increased professionalism of the judiciary, public awareness of legal rights, and the transition of the justice system from UNMIK to Kosovar competencies.  A grant to ABA/CEELI focuses on increasing the professionalism of legal advocates through support to the Chamber of Advocates, promoting adoption of continuing legal education, publishing of a legal index, and other activities.  In the area of local governance USAID plans to fund a new initiative to strengthen local governance, improve municipal leadership, increase transparency and accountability at the local level, and assist municipal governments to promote local economic development.

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is issuing a Request for Comments (RFC) to solicit industry suggestions and best practices for the management and payment of insurer claims for reimbursement as part of its implementation of Title I of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the Act). Section 104 (a) of the Act provides that, “[T]he Secretary may employ persons or contract for services as may be necessary to implement the Program.”  

The Act establishes a temporary Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (Program) under which the Federal Government will share the risk of insured loss from certified acts of terrorism with commercial property and casualty insurers until the Program sunsets on December 31, 2005.  However, Section 108(b) of the Act provides the authority to pay or adjust compensation for insured losses after termination of the Act.

Interested parties may request the RFC from the Contracting Officer, John A. Palmieri, through email requests at john.palmieri@do.treas.gov. Responses in the form of questions for clarification, suggestions based upon the questions raised by Treasury in the RFC, and interest in meetings with Treasury to discuss industry best practices should be submitted to the Contracting Officer by email at john.palmieri@do.treas.gov  by October 24, 2003.  Treasury will use the commentary and suggestions to determine if vendor meetings are in order and to solidify the Statement of Work that will be used for the Request for Proposals (RFP) that will solicit offers for proposals from the vendor community.

The RFC package will include a draft version of the proposed statement of work, a list of questions soliciting vendor input and suggestions, and a copy of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. This Request for Comments is not a request for proposals and the Department of Treasury is not liable for any costs incurred as a result of vendor responses to the RFC.

<DESC>Joint Accessories Commodity Council (JACC)
1680 Federal Stock Class (FSC)
Industry Day


Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, in partnership with the Defense Supply Center Richmond, will host a Joint Accessories Industry Day on 29 28 Oct, 2003 at 1:00 p.m from 9:00 a.m. through 3 p.m.. Central Standard Time, at the Reed Center in Midwest City, OK.  Sign in will begin at 12:30 p.m. 8:00 a.m.  This is an advertisement for the Industry Day only and no solicitation is available at this time.  Any resulting procurement action will be the subject of a separate, future announcement.  The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any contract associated with this event.  The following information is provided for discussion purposes and any potential strategy for this acquisition may change prior to any solicitation release.  The purpose of this interactive Industry Day is to identify Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM) best practices for Federal Stock Class 1680, which encompasses a variety of miscellaneous Aircraft accessories.  

A Joint Accessories Commodity Council has been formed, and will be pursuing the development of an AFMC enterprise sourcing strategy long-term business arrangements, which could result in contractual documents for new purchases and repairs for FSC 1680 items managed by the USAF and DLA.  The goals of any forthcoming sourcing strategy will be to improve the readiness, and increase the responsiveness of the supply chain and reduce costs.  We desire to achieve reductions in the overall volume of contracts for this commodity, as well as administrative and production lead times, to enhance asset availability/visibility and lower total ownership costs.  PSCM incorporates many initiatives and concepts to enhance material support by integrating and streamlining supply chain functions.    As a part of sustainment transformation, the Government is committed to fundamentally change our business processes through these guiding principles:

„hEnterprise-wide leveraging via standardization of processes, technology, organizational structure and skills.
„hCentralized Commodity-focused sourcing.
„hCollaborative relationships with customers and suppliers.
„hA well-trained and educated workforce that is flexible, multi-skilled and one who sustains continuous improvement.
„hUse of a single balanced scorecard with alignment of responsibility, authority and accountability.
„hInformation technology that provides accurate, timely data.

  In order to achieve success, the Government plans to develop a number of flexible and dynamic contract vehicles, covering the spectrum of FSC 1680 items, tailored to meet the unique requirements of technologies and workload characteristics.  Expected success would result in improved customer support performance, with reductions of production lead time and total cost of ownership.

Industry input to design this into the strategy development process is critical for the Government to understand the supply base capabilities related to achieving the above contract designs and provisions that are ¡§real¡¨ benefits to suppliers so the Government can achieve its objectives.  

The Industry Day format will include a Government presentation on Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM) f the PSCM goals and objectives, a general question and answer session, opportunities for one-on-one Government and supplier side meetings, and a joint wrap up session.  Suppliers are requested to identify think outside the box to identify improvements allowing that would allow suppliers to best meet the Gthe Government¡¦s to meet the stated objectives.  Potential improvement areas might include commercially available supply chain services, types of contracts and incentives, co-forecasting, on demand supply, etc.  Topics might include: contract types, provisions, clauses, incentives, metrics, co-forecasting, flexibility, continuous improvement, diminishing sources and other constraints, prime vendor relationships, one-pass contracting, on-demand supply etc.

Suppliers interested in attending and/or presenting are requested to reply with tentative attendees by 10  Oct.  A questionnaire will be sent to respondents.  Final registration is not later than 22 Oct.  There will be a $25 conference fee for each attendee.  Reply to Mr Jeff Van Woerkom, 405-739-4101.  submit the attached attendee form and email or fax the form to TBD at TBD¡K no later than 24 Oct 03.  There will be a $TBD conference fee for each attendee, which covers lunch and breaks on both days. 

 The Government anticipates releasing through this website one or more strategies as a result of this industry day, for supplier review and comment on by the end of Dec 03.  A follow-on industry day is currently anticipated in late Jan 0304.

<SUBJECT>D -- Maintenance and Support Services for Certain Community-Supported Linux Distributions
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFIPDO1
<RESPDATE>101703

<DESC>The National Weather Service (NWS), within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), requests information from parties who are interested in and capable of providing maintenance, support, and system integration services for one or more of the following Linux distributions: Debian Gnu/Linux;
Red Hat Linux Project Linux; or Slackware Linux.
For convenience, those distributions will be referred to hereafter as “community supported Linux distributions” (CSLDs).

Generally speaking, the service provider will provide those services which would, in the case of a commercial distribution,  be provided by the distribution vendor.  The required services include all of the following:  
a)	Providing patches as required.  In the event that the CLSD’s organization does not provide an acceptable patch for a bug that has the potential to impact NWS operations, the service provider will provide such a patch.
b)	Testing patches.  On request, the service provider will test patches on specified configurations of the CSLD.  Those tests might be carried out on Government-furnished equipment or at Government sites.
c) 	Adapting drivers.  In the event that the NWS equires a driver for a device that is not supported for a CSLD version the NWS is using, the service provider will adapt an existing Linux driver.  
d) 	Installation support.  The service provider will provide consultation and possibly on-site support for installation of the CSLD on off-the-shelf and customized X86-based desktop, workstation, and server systems.

It is expected that the NWS will require support, as outlined above, for a given CSLD version for about three years following its initial release.  Target platforms include high-performance graphics workstations, high-availability server clusters, office desktop systems, web servers, and other configurations.  NWS will use its own servers to deploy patches.

Responders are encouraged to suggest additional support and system integration services that might assist the Government in using one or more of the above-listed CSLDs in mission-critical, enterprise-scale systems.  However, the following are explicitly outside the scope of this Request for Information:  deployment and installation of patches;  update management systems; and configuration management systems.

Interested parties should respond in writing with the following information:
a)	A description of the scope of the services the vendor proposes to offer to meet the above-described needs.
b)	The approximate number of employees the vendor has who are qualified to provide the service.
c)	Whether the vendor would use subcontractors in providing this service.
d)	A description of  any relevant past experience.  For example: which CSLDs and versions the responder has supported; what kind of support was provided; types and numbers of hardware platforms on which the CSLD was supported; length of relevant experience.  Where possible, names of customers should be provided.
e)	Any other information that will assist the NWS in judging the vendor’s qualifications for this task.
f)	A suggested fee structure.  (No actual cost or pricing information is required at this time.)

Responders to this RFI should provide a point of contact, including the representative’s name, email address, and telephone number.

Written responses to this RFI should not exceed ten (10) pages.  Please submit digital copies to Phillip D. Osborne (Phillip.Osborne@noaa.gov) in either WordPerfect or Microsoft Word formats.  Responses should be received no later than 10/17/2003.

Responding to this RFI is not a prerequisite for participating in any subsequent acquisition.

<DESC>NA Sources Sought Number: DASG60-03-0010.  The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to determine if a sufficient number of small business concerns exist to obtain adequate competition to support a determination for small business set-aside.  Large busin esses should not respond at this time.  This special announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the small business community in the Analysis and Exploitation Center (AEC)- formerly the center for the Optical Data Analysis (OD A) program - competition at the prime contractor level, and (2) to roughly gauge the capability of those interested small business firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level.  The capability papers and associated evaluations discusse d in this notice do NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firm or team's ability to perform; that evaluation will be part of the formal source selection process.  As the Government is unsure of the extent of anticipated small and small disadvantaged bus iness participation, it is undecided as to how many and/or what types of set-aside awards to target during the development of its acquisition strategy.  The extent of small business participation is made more complicated by the Small Business Administratio n (SBA) rules on affiliation, teaming, and limitations on subcontracting.  Briefly, small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award of a set-aside contract, providing that each team member meets the NAICS code small busines s definition for that procurement.  The rules allow a set-aside when there is an expectation of two or more competitive offers from small businesses or small business teams when at least 50% of the services will be performed by the small business or the co llective efforts of all small business members of the team.  Further, the current affiliation rules allow 8(a) joint ventures or teams when each team member is small according to the applicable NAICS Code and the 8(a) concern performs a 'significant amount ' of the work with its own employees.  Such teams and/or joint ventures require the prior approval of the SBA.  Small Businesses should note the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code and size standard is 541710/1,000 employees.  The co ntractors will be expected to provide non-personal services for technical analysis in support of the AEC mission - to provide comprehensive technical assessments, recommendations, analysis products, and critical lessons learned in a timely manner to the US  Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC), the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), intelligence agencies, Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Elements, and other appropriate organizations and agencies.  The AEC will be located in a Government facility i n Huntsville, AL.  Day-to-day AEC operation, as well as hardware acquisition and maintenance, is anticipated to be provided via a separate contract.  The contractor(s) will perform all analysis efforts within the AEC.  It is anticipated that the analysis r equirements will be executed via competitive task orders issued based on actual customer requirements.  This support is both broad ranging and ever changing.  The planned scope of work (SOW) includes six (6) functional areas: Pre-Mission Data Collection Pl anning, Data Reduction, Data Analysis and Exploitation, Target Modeling and Signature Generation, Algorithm Technology Development and Evaluation, and Special Studies as directed by MDA to address issues critical to system elements.  This acquisition is an ticipated to result in at least two (2) awards with identical SOWs and numbers of person-hours.  The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor c ould propose as a prime contractor as well as participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams).  Further, we do not intend to impose any res trictions on team membership after award.  The resultant contracts will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful proposer from participating in any other SMDC or MDA contracts.  To the greatest extent possib le, while still protecting the Government's interests, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the contractor's actual AEC technical analysis performance.  Any small business firms, including 8(a) firms, intending to propo se as a prime contractor (especially those planning to use the SBA affiliation and teaming rules) are requested to submit a capability paper to the Government (limited to 5 pages).  Interested firms should submit an email stating your interest in the acqui sition and including the requested paper to the Government within 45 calendar days after the date of this announcement to john.penley@smdc.army.mil (title email 'Analysis and Exploitation Center (AEC) Capability Papers').  The capability papers should addr ess the overall proposed team, including the prime and subcontractors and shall focus on issues that affect the decision as to number/types of set-aside awards such as: (1) the breadth and depth of technical and management expertise on the team to successf ully execute the resultant contract, (2) the capability to quickly ramp up qualified and trained personnel at the onset of the contract, (3) the capability to administer and manage an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, task order contract (expected t o be an 11-year award term - 3 base years and four 2-year award terms) with numerous subcontractors, (4) assurance that the small business firm or small business team will perform 50% of the work, (5) capability to perform realistic cost and schedule proje ctions for complex technical and integration efforts, (6) a contract management structure that allows for an integrated organization accountable for total performance responsibility, and (7) an understanding of Army, DoD, and Government Agencies with whom AEC interfaces.  This acquisition will not open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.

(MDA intends to make awards on the basis of an integrated assessment of technical merit and estimated cost.)

	MDA/MP plans a budget for all work under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of up to $5 million for fiscal year ’04 and fiscal year ’05.  However, these budgeted amounts are subject to change.   
	
	This BAA will remain open until October 3, 2005. Responses will be evaluated as received, but may take up to six months to complete.  If MDA decides to pursue a concept, a formal proposal will be requested.  

	The MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA.  Awards are anticipated to occur in late FY 2004 through FY 2005.  Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.

This program will include a three-day executive level course   designed to provide our newly selected flag officers or SES’ with the ability to think strategically and globally to lead themselves and their organization through major periods of transformation and change.  This program will enhance the student’s ability to assess and identify the need and methods for change in both the internal and external environment within their respective agencies.

ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.
 
    (1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

    (2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT-C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD: VOYAGE CHARTER FORCE PROTECTION.

(1)  Owner agrees to US Armed Forces personnel may board the vessel at any time at any location for US national security purposes, gives consent for such boarding, and agrees to cooperate fully with such US Armed Forces personnel on the boarding party.

Owner agrees to provide at owner’s sole expense, lifesaving equipment for up to 12 personnel in compliance with SOLAS and all applicable regulatory regulations.  Charterer reserves the right, at Charterer’s sole option, to embark armed US Armed Forces members.  These armed forces personnel will provide security in accordance with rules of engagement established by US Military Authorities, and will operate under the command of competent US Military Authorities.  Charterer agrees reimburse the Owner of cost of such additional personnel at the rate set forth in the Charter for Supercargoes.  

ADD: CREW LIST.  Offerors must provide a certified crew list prior to award but no later than delivery of the vessel at the load port (or first designated load port in that case of multiple load ports).

The list shall be submitted in an electronic format (Microsoft Excel).

ADD: SECURITY THREAT.  In the event of a security threat or incident involving the ship, crew or cargo during the voyage, the ship's master should report any incident immediately to the MSC Area Command in whose area the ship is currently located.  The MSCHQ Command Center should be contacted if the Area Command cannot be reached.  Contact numbers will be provided upon award.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

STATEMENT OF WORK
DMLSS-FACILITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SUSTAINMENT SPECIALISTS
NAVY BUREAU OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
FACILITIES DIVISION (M3M3)

1.0  Background

As a result of the Functional Process Improvement Review of 1994, the Defense Medical Standard Support Automated Information System (DMLSS-AIS) was developed to support medical logistics management practices throughout the Military Healthcare System (MHS).  DMLSS-Facility Management (DMLSS-FM) is a component of this system that provides standardized facility and plant assets management capabilities throughout Navy Medicine with:

·	Work Request / Work Order Management
·	Operations & Maintenance Management
·	Space and Assets Management
·	Project Management 
·	Regulatory Compliance (RC)
·	Computer Aided Drafting & Design (CADD) Functionality
·	Various integrated Commercial off the shelf (COTS) products 

DMLSS-FM is presently deployed to approximately 30 MTFs, managing approximately 10 million square feet of Navy Medicine’s nearly 16 million square feet of total assets.  As DMLSS-FM is established as the mandatory standard facility management AIS throughout Navy Medicine, and as implementation of the DMLSS/Maximo IO occurs, the need for qualified DMLSS-FM implementation trainers and support personnel will become paramount.  Therefore, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Facilities (M3M3) has an immediate need to establish worldwide DMLSS activation and support services for system implementation and training; database support; drawing usability, conversion and integration; and front-line functional support for Navy MTFs. 


2.0 Description of Work Required

The contractor shall provide technical and training support to M3M3 during system proliferation and sustainment of the DMLSS-FM-AIS. The contractor will ensure Navy interests are protected, Navy requirements are satisfied, and functional integrity is maintained at all affected Navy MTFs or support facilities.  The contractor shall therefore represent M3M3 in properly supporting Navy interests in the activation and training of assigned facility management AIS applications and periphery systems.  As time permits, limited input of critical elements of both field data and CADD will be necessary in the execution of this contract.  Extensive travel (national and international) is required and estimated at up to 40 weeks.  A minimum estimate of  50% of the effort will occur at remote locations both in and out CONUS.  


3.0 Technical Requirements (Tasks):

Task 1.	The contractor shall represent M3M3 in the proliferation of DMLSS FM throughout Navy Medicine activities in support of enhanced facility management practices.   The contractor must be knowledgeable in all DMLSS Releases and applications deployed in order to adequately support individual MTF requirements. 

Task 2.	The contractor shall provide necessary services in support of validating, updating and maintaining data and drawings necessary to fully implement DMLSS-FM at Navy MTFs in compliance to DMLSS standards.  As necessary, contract personnel will review and validate data and drawing accuracy and completeness.  As time permits, limited input of data and actual drawing modifications are required to ensure and promote customer usability and familiarity.

Task 3.	Functional training:  The contractor shall provide complete functional training support for implementation and sustainment of the DMLSS-FM application.  This task shall include support for all applicable DMLSS Releases for testing, training, deployment, functional review, and system change request for future development consideration.  Therefore, the contractor must be proficient in the functional knowledge and use of the DMLSS system and the COTS products.  It is expected the bulk of this training will be at the remote on-site location.

Task 4.	The contractor shall act as the first line of support for technical and functional assistance for all Navy MTFs having implemented DMLSS-FM.   This shall include both on-site and remote support via telephonic and/or electronic means.

Task 5. 	The contractor shall provide additional services in the implementation of supporting applications and products necessary to enhance Navy facility management practices.  These may include but are not limited to Interoperability (IO) with the NAVFAC Maximo AIS, future efforts of IO (FCA, etc) with Engineering Field Activities (EFA), and various reporting tools.

Task 6.	The contractor may be required to assist with future development efforts as a functional representative on Joint Application Development Working Groups (JADWGs) or other application development team as deemed appropriate.

Task 7.	 CADD/Data Input / Modification.  The Contractor may be required to accomplish significant on-site data input and / or drawing development / modification to further support DMLSS-FM activation and site improvements.   

Task 8.	In-depth training for the COTS products:  The contractor shall provide regional in-depth training sessions conducted by trainers intimately familiar with the software.  Four two-week sessions, regionally distributed, at government locations, are envisioned during the contract period.
