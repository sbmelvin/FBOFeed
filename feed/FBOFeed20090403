<SUBJECT>N -- AUTOMATED CALL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
<SOLNBR>R2031
<CONTACT>Margaret Young margaret.young@gunter.af.mil

<a href="mailto:margaret.young@gunter.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>The Field Assistance Service (FAS) requires a complete solution to provide a robust Automated Call Distribution (ACD) system.  The proposed strategy must work with existing analog phones and support 200 to 400 telephone analysts in a compartmentalized team environment.  The Vendor's ACD solution must be capable of being managed by a tech support staff with limited or nonexistent computer programming skills.  The call tree must be maintained using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) solution, and allow for future expansion and other modifications by this tech support staff.  The Vendor's ACD solution must have integrated voicemail that places messages directly into personal or team Outlook inboxes.  Vendor shall provide all maintenance and support using one vendor and one contact number.  The ACD shall include the commercial standard warranty, to include parts, labor, software, and travel.  The ACD shall maintain a 99.99% reliability rate or better.  The ACD shall have opt! ions for routing incoming calls through a customizable call tree, transferring calls, establishing conference calls with selective drop capability, allowing supervisors to change technician availability status remotely, assigning technicians to call queues, placing customers on hold, tracking call metrics and producing statistical reports based on call volume and abandon rates at either the queue level or the user level, exporting the reports in a common office format (text, PDF, xml, html, or MS Office), and the ability to view calls currently waiting in the call queue.  ACD client software must be JITC certified and on the Approved Products List (APL) for use on a Windows Vista PC in the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) environment.  ACD must be IPv4 and IPv6 capable.  Vendor will include a plan for minimizing downtime associated with transitioning from the old ACD system to the new, as well as any plans for data migration from old to new.  ACD must be deployed n! o later than November 2009.  The Vendor will provide technician training, supervisory training, and administrative training for the ACD solution.
OVERARCHING REQUIREMENT/GOAL: The goal of this intended contracting action is to solicit and award a Delivery Order (DO) using firm-fixed-price under a pre-existing indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract.  Under this DO, the Vendor will design, document, support accreditation, test, qualify, and deploy an ACD system that utilizes commercially available PRODUCTS. The solution must work seamlessly with existing analog telephones
REQUIRED PERSONNEL SKILLS: While a majority of the tasks required to complete the subject effort (e.g., site surveys, site designs, procurement, installation, and training and acceptance test) will be completed on a Firm Fixed Price basis, there could be some subset of effort(s) that may be accomplished using a COST CLIN.PERIOD/PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Maxwell Air Force Base-Gunter Annex, AL 36114
INTENDED EVALUATION CRITERIA Proven relevant past performance for services provided on ACD systems will be a significant evaluation factor for potential award. Prospective Vendors will be required to submit sanitized resumes of individuals proposed to fulfill the requirements of any contract which may result in award for this requirement.  Cost will also be a factor.  Interested Vendors should submit their capabilities information to the e-mail addresses listed in the RFI attachment.  Please include the name and address of your company.  Please limit your responses to a maximum of three (3) pages.  If applicable, the submission should include the past performance history for similar projects that are complete or near completion with a customer point of contact and phone number.  All interested, responsible potential firms must submit their written responses NO LATER THAN Close of Business (COB) 5:00 pm CST on April 15, 2009.  The Air Force will not pay for any information, d! ocumentation, and/or data submitted in response to this notice. Responses can be E-mailed to Sophia Smith, Contract Specialist (Sophia.smith@gunter.af.mil) and Corlis J. Allen, Program Manager (corlis.allen@gunter.af.mil).

The objective isto extend the performance period. The current Contractor provides the following mission critical support services underARC's Logistics Management Services (JS) for the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration (NASA) Ames Research Center and Moffett Field  (MF), Camp Parks locations. ARC and MF includes on-site and off-site  Government, contract tenant organizations andAnnexes 1- Military housing  inside Moffett, 2- Military housing located outside MainGate, west of Moffett  Blvd. Extension, and 3- Military housing located on Moffett Blvd,west of US  101. The services are to be obtained by means of a combination firm-fixedprice, cost reimbursable, and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract.  Theseservices shall include:  (1) supply and warehouse management; (2) equipment management;(3) mail services; (4) shipping and receiving services; (5) fleet management; (6) refuseservices; (7) janitorial services and (8) industrial property management. The Contractorshall provide all resources, including labor, supervision, tools, equipment, materials,transportation, and management necessary to operate logistics and specialized functionsas described in the Statement of Work (SOW).This extension will allow the necessary time to define a competitive follow-onprocurement based on the agency-wide policy. In addition the extension will allow for acontinuation of services to ensure program continuity and critical mission support andavoid significant Logistic service impacts while a competitive follow-on is developed. NASA originally posted-an intent to award a six-month bridge contract. However, adecision has been made to add three additional months.	Therefore, this bridge is for apotential nine-month period, from May 1, 2009 through the nine-months, consisting of afive-month base and four, one-month options. The current contractor, Tessada &Associates, Inc., is considered the only contractor that can meet ARCs needs given theshort period of performance for the extension. Award to another source at the same timethe recompete is in process would result in substantial duplication of cost to theGovernment that is not expected to be recovered through competition of the extension aswell as unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARCs requirements.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 12:00 P.M. PST onApril 8, 2009.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purposeof determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Questions regardingthe extension can be sent via email to Lana Jones Clemon at Lana.Jones.Clemon@nasa.gov. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

                            2009 Transportation and Air Quality Emissions Analysis
		            DTFH61-09-R-00014

The Office of Planning, Environment and Realty within the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) intends to issue a multiple award Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  

The FHWA intends to issue a BAA solicitation for proposals for research and development projects that could lead to better understanding and advances for tools and methodologies in conducting emissions analysis for transportation projects in the United States on or about May 17, 2009.  The solicitation will be distributed through the General Services Administration Federal Business Opportunities web site at www.fbo.gov.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available.  The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including amendments, will be distributed through this site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to insure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the upcoming BAA is to advance the practice and application of emissions analysis and modeling among state, regional and local transportation and air quality agencies in meeting specific transportation provisions in the Clean Air Act, and to disseminate these techniques and approaches in a timely manner. 

PROGRAM SCOPE:  The program scope is intentionally ambitious and broad to address the wide spectrum of topics and objectives that the funded investigations can support. 

FOCUS AREAS:  Four focus areas within emissions analysis and modeling are of particular strategic interest and relevance to the FHWA.  Proposals in these areas are highly encouraged.  This guidance is provided to help offerors in the development of proposals of particular interest to the FHWA.  These areas as consistent with emphasis areas identified for the Surface Transportation Environment and Planning Cooperative Research Program developed under Section 5207 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), Public Law 109-59;119 stat. 1797 (August10, 2005).  See http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/hep/step/index.htm for more information.  

The four focus areas are: 

(1) Testing, Evaluation and Validation of New Emission Models and Methodologies

The EPA has released a demo version of the new emission model, Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) in 2007.  When the final version is released in 2009, MOVES will replace the existing emissions model, and will be required for a variety of emissions and air quality analysis for conformity, the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) and other regulatory purposes.  This research effort would include a number of tasks, including reviewing the MOVES model and identifying issues of concern for the transportation community and evaluating, testing, and validating the model to assure accurate and relevant results.  Major research areas may include:

a. Identify transportation data collection needs (e.g., vehicle fleet data, truck VMT and speed, speeds on local roads, start and parking patterns, extended idle, etc.) and gather relevant data; evaluate the reliability of assumptions that are used to estimate traffic data for use in MOVES, including the assumptions behind the MOVES default traffic data.
b. Examine data conversion methodologies for converting existing data to be compatible with MOVES
c. Evaluate and document changes in emissions between MOVES and other emissions models (MOBILE6 and EMFAC) using real world examples or case studies
d. Conduct a needs assessment for uncertainty analysis for MOVES; identify or develop estimation methods to quantify uncertainty.
e. Identify model calibration and validation issues related to transportation/traffic data, such as modal activities, vehicle mix, and traffic operations
f. Conduct MOVES sensitivity analysis such as testing model sensitivity to speed and congestion levels and ability to account for emissions benefits of congestion-relief measures
g. Evaluate the sensitivity of MOVES for project level analysis of typical highway and/or transit projects
h. Examine how typical transportation projects change driving cycle and Vehicle Specific Power (VSP) distribution; explore integration of MOVES and project level traffic simulation models
i. Low-cost methodologies for developing alternative drive cycles for use in the MOVES model based on real-world data, including instrumented vehicle studies, GPS, ITS data, cell phone data, and other technologies.
j. Methodologies to characterize and account for non-recurring congestion in MOVES model inputs.
k. Examine the application of MOVES in the evaluation of emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions, benefits of different transportation strategies such as transit, congestion pricing, non-motorized strategies, etc.

(2) Research on Conducting Project Level Analysis

In its conformity regulations, the EPA acknowledged that the current emissions model is not appropriate for conducting local emissions impact, especially for particulate matter (PM).  In the absence of an appropriate model and guidance, although PM local hot-spot analysis has been required since 1993, the EPA has yet to require quantitative emissions analysis until a new emissions model and associated analysis guidance are released.  Given the recent interest in project level analysis for Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSAT) under the NEPA, these pollutants should be included in the list of emissions to be analyzed in each of the research tasks.

This focus area will examine a number of issues related to the project level (including hot spot) emissions analysis.  Possible research areas may include:

a. Examine traffic characteristics (volumes, speeds, congestion levels, etc.) and its relationship to local emissions
b. Evaluate critical factors that may impact localized project level emissions such as background concentration, sensitive receptors, land use,  and other meteorology and environmental factors
c. Establish emissions gradients along transportation corridors to identify impact zone and to locate sensitive receptors
d. Evaluate and assess dispersion models, especially the applicability in project level analysis.  Such an evaluation may consider the inherent and reducible uncertainties associated with modeling and its input conditions and how any uncertainty in the estimates affects regulatory decisions
e. Develop/evaluate methodologies to calculate emissions benefits for project level mitigation measures
f. Conduct analysis for emissions impacts of congestion relief strategies such as ramp metering, HOV and HOT lanes, congestion pricing projects, etc.
g. Examine the emissions impact of activities at intermodal and port facilities such as diesel reduction strategies
h. Provide analytical support for CO and PM categorical hot-spot findings
i. Develop/evaluate methodologies for lifecycle greenhouse gas analysis at the regional and project level.

(3) Air Quality and Transportation Conformity Outreach and Communication

The goal of the outreach and communication focus area is to inform and provide technical assistance in an easily accessible format and to identify new and innovative methods of communicating scientific and regulatory information on transportation and air quality to our State and local partners and to stakeholders.  The EPA and the FHWA currently conduct extensive outreach on transportation and air quality issues; the objective for this focus area is to identify new methods of communication on air quality topic areas that are not fully addressed.  These efforts may include: 

a. Develop strategies to facilitate outreach and communications to the transportation and air quality communities on issues related to air quality and transportation including requirements in the clean air act and transportation legislation; synthesis and compilation of research results etc.  The strategies may include a combination of presentations at conferences, written materials (hard copy and online), webcasts/webinars, web-based communities of practice, teleconferences, video conferences, public education materials, etc.
b. Document best practices including project level analyses, models and methodologies to apply in specific situations such as modeling protocol
c. Develop training materials and conduct training sessions for various transportation and air quality related topics

(4) Fleet Data for On-road Mobile Sources Emissions Inventory

Vehicle fleet data is one of the critical factors in emissions inventory development.  Research should focus on how State and local transportation and air quality agencies develop fleet data for State Implementation Plan (SIP), conformity, and other air quality analyses and to provide insight on how fleet VMT, especially diesel truck VMT are estimated for use in such analyses.  Possible research areas include: 

a. Research and document how State vehicle registration data has been adapted for SIP and conformity analyses and how specific tools, such as vehicle identification number (VIN) decoders have been successfully used to improve the credibility of fleet data.
b. How diesel truck VMT is being accounted for in SIP, conformity and other air quality analysis, and how these VMT estimates can be improved.  Evaluate tools and methods that are being used to estimate intraregional (e.g. delivery trucks, garbage trucks) and interregional (e.g., interstate freight trucks)
c. Research methodologies for estimating urban and rural freight/commercial vehicle activity by vehicle class and methodologies for developing age distributions for heavy-duty trucks in urban and rural areas
d. Research methodologies to estimate hours of heavy-duty truck and construction equipment idling, and to estimate the effectiveness of idle reduction strategies.
e. Identify or develop methods to estimate future market penetration and effectiveness of GHG reduction (fuel efficiency) and idle reduction technologies in heavy-duty trucks and construction equipment.

GENERAL INFORMATION:  The FHWA has budgeted approximately $950,000 to fund this research program.  Upon issuance of the solicitation, proposals will be evaluated using a two-part process consisting of pre-proposals and full-proposals.

The solicitation will be distributed through the General Services Administration Federal Business Opportunities web site at www.fbo.gov.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available.  The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including amendments, will be distributed through this site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to insure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

BACKGROUND
Section 5512 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), Public Law 109-59, provides funding for the acceleration of the Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS) deployment, training on the use of TRANSIMS and development of new applications of TRANSIMS.  The goals of a future Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) are as follows: 
• The use of simulation-based models is evolving in transportation planning practice.  The BAA will support investigations directed toward increasing practitioner knowledge and understanding of travel modeling and simulation; 
• SAFETEA-LU calls for the deployment of TRANSIMS.  A future BAA is intended to broaden the TRANSIMS user base by emphasizing teaming and application to local planning issues; and 
• SAFETEA-LU calls for TRANSIMS studies on a wide range of topics.  To this end, a future BAA will provide for locally relevant applications of TRANSIMS representing a diversity of populations, geographic regions, and analysis methods.

TRANSIMS is an agent-based travel simulation system designed to meet the State Department of Transportations’ (DOTs') and Metropolitan Planning Organizations’ (MPOs') need for higher fidelity transportation planning and emissions analyses.  Because TRANSIMS simulates and tracks travel by individuals, the benefits and impacts on different travel markets can be evaluated.  Furthermore, TRANSIMS has the capability to evaluate highly congested scenarios and operational changes on highways and transit systems.  TRANSIMS differs from previous travel demand forecasting methods in its underlying concepts and structure.  These differences include a consistent and continuous representation of time, a detailed representation of persons and households; time-dependent routing; and a person-based micro simulator.

There are four primary modules: Population synthesizer, Activity generator, Route planner, and Traffic micro simulator.  Using these components, a model may be constructed that estimates activities for individuals and households, plans trips satisfying those activities, assigns trips to routes, and creates a micro simulation of all persons, vehicles and resulting traffic on modeled transport systems in given study area.
Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (www.lanl.gov) designed and developed the original TRANSIMS algorithms and software.  The design for TRANSIMS is based on requirements in:

• the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (Public Law (PL) 102-240), 
• the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) (PL 105-178) as amended by the TEA 21 Restoration Act (PL 105-206), and 
• The Clean Air Act of 1990 (PL 101-549) Amendments. 

The development of TRANSIMS has been funded by the Federal Highway Administration with support from the Federal Transit Administration, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy of the United States Department of Transportation, and by the Environmental Protection Agency.
 
CURRENT STATUS

TRANSIMS development has proceeded along several lines.  These include development of application methods, data sets, and software

The following methods have been used on multiple studies.  Further documentation can be found at http://transims-opensource.org  and http://tmip.fhwa.dot.gov/transims.

• Network data synthesis: Methods for translating multimodal link-node databases for use in TRANSIMS have been developed and documented.  These include insertion of GIS-based centerline files and estimating traffic control characteristics.
• Trip-based network simulation: Methods for translating regional trip tables into time-varying highway demand data; routing and simulating highway; equilibrating highway route flows; and calibration have been developed.  Also referred to as “Track 1” methods, this approach is currently recommended as the starting point for initiating a TRANSIMS study.  These methods rely on trip processing and selection tools, the router, and the micro simulator.
• Household activity simulation: Quick response methods for generating household activities, schedules, and locations have been developed.  Methods for routing and simulating of highway tours are under development. 

Data Sets

Several data sets are available for research, development, and testing.  These include notional grid and freeway data sets, validation data sets derived from the NGSIM program, and a demonstration data set based on Alexandria VA.  These data sets may be browsed at http://transims.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/transims/version4/trunk/case_studies/. 

Software

The software and source code are made available under the NASA Open Source Agreement v1.3.  This license makes the source code open to the public and requires that any changes to the original code remain publicly available.  The license permits use within other software without restriction.  For further information, see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/nasa1.3.php  
TRANSIMS is implemented as a toolbox and over forty software tools have been developed based on the work in Portland and other studies.  These include methods to convert node and link data into TRANSIMS format, estimate intersection signalization, and assist with data preparation and application.  The TRANSIMS software is written primarily in C++.  However, 32-bit and 64-bit versions are available for Linux and Windows.  Support is available via documentation and forums.  The software and source code is available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/transims/.  For more information on the software, forums, and supporting utilities, see http://transims-opensource.org/


OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the upcoming solicitation will seek projects that demonstrate the capabilities of TRANSIMS.  Possible demonstration of TRANSIMS capabilities would include, but not be limited to, modeling an entire region, modeling a sub-region larger than typical traffic simulations, or applying a person based simulation to the sub-region.  Furthermore, the FHWA seeks to expand the knowledge, understanding and implementation of TRANSIMS capabilities and applications, and seeks to develop new approaches, tools, and applications covering a diversity of methods, users and geographic area. 

Objectives
1. Apply TRANSIMS to local issues of interest with the involvement of public agencies,
2. Employ a multidisciplinary, team-oriented approach, and
3. Employ a sound methodology clearly appropriate to the study issues and available data.

GENERAL  INFORMATION:  The FHWA has budgeted approximately $1,400,000 to fund this research program.  Upon issuance of the solicitation, proposals will be evaluated using a two-part process consisting of pre-proposals and full-proposals.

<a href="mailto:Julie.A.Janus@nasa.gov">Julie A. Janus</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for a separation systemfor the mechanical subsystems of the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) Project.  The MMSmission is the fourth mission of the Solar Terrestrial Probe (STP) program of NASA.  TheMMS mission will use four identically instrumented observatories to perform the firstdefinitive study of magnetic reconnection in space and will test critical hypothesesabout reconnection.  Magnetic reconnection is the primary process by which energy istransferred from the solar wind to the Earths magnetosphere and is also fundamental tothe explosive release of energy during substorms and solar flares.  The MMS mission willstudy magnetic reconnection in the Earths magnetosphere.  The four MMS observatorieswill be required to fly in a tetrahedral formation in order to unambiguously determinethe orientation of the magnetic reconnection layer.NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to RUAG AerospaceSweden AB for four (4) flight launch vehicle separation systems for the MagnetosphericMultiscale (MMS) Project.  RUAG Aerospace shall deliver (3) three flight unit launchvehicle separation systems and one (1) flight unit passive half of a launch vehicleseparation system in support of the mechanical subsystems of the MMS Project.	Theproposed acquisition is for four (4) flight launch vehicle separation system units.  RUAGAerospace will provide the materials and labor to deliver the (4) flight launch vehicleseparation system units to be used to secure the four (4) MMS observatories to each otherand the bottom MMS observatory to the active half of the launch vehicle separationsystem.  These units will be incorporated into the mechanical subsystem of the MMSmission.   The period of performance is approximately 21 months for delivery.RUAG Aerospace is uniquely qualified for this contract because of their extensiveexperience and expertise.  Further, they are the only organization currently qualified toperform the subject requirement for the following reasons:    (1) Science requirementsdictate identical observatory shapes, which would also require identical separationsystems between stacked MMS observatories and the separation system used by the launchvehicle.  MMS Science requirements necessitate identical observatory designs in order toproduce identical observatory electrostatic signatures.  Identical electrostaticsignatures require identical observatory shapes because both the distribution ofelectrostatic charge on observatory surfaces and the photo-emissive cloud that surroundsthe observatory on-orbit are driven by shape and surface materials.  If the signatures ofthe observatories are not identical then electric field measurements betweenobservatories cannot be compared without unacceptable errors that would lead to aviolation of mission science requirements.  Since the bottom observatory in the stackwill mate to the Atlas V upper stage, all separation systems between the observatoriesmust be the same design as that used by the Atlas V, which exclusively uses RUAG units.   (2) There would be significant costs in redesigning and revalidating the launch vehicleseparation system and modifying the launch vehicle for a new design.  A change in theseparation system that the launch vehicle utilizes could support the science drivenrequirements, but this would necessitate a major design change on the part of the launchvehicle, which was just recently awarded in March 2009.  The costs to re-design a newseparation system, change the launch vehicle, and requalification are expected to costseveral times more than the value of the separation system contract with RUAG Aerospace. (3) RUAG Aerospace is the only known provider of separation systems of the size neededfor the MMS mission.  Based on responses to a Request for Information (RFI) datedDecember 3, 2007, and an informal market survey, other viable vendors do not exist toprovide a practical option.  The MMS projects market survey indicates that RUAGAerospace provides most of the separation systems for Western payloads and provides allseparation systems in the size and payload mass range that the MMS project requires(approximately 1666 mm and 5100 kg).  Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only OneResponsible Source.  However, organizations who believe they can provide these serviceswithout any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work, shouldfully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of thissynopsis.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon April 20, 2009.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be consideredby the agency.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to post a solicitation for up to three Concept Studies Contracts for the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) S-band Radar and Radar Suite Controller.  NAVSEA intends to award multiple Firm Fixed Price study contracts via full and open competition.  The solicitation will be issued electronically via http://www.neco.navy.mil.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided or mailed.  Interested offerors should monitor FEDBIZOPPS for the release of the solicitation.  Since this solicitation, and any applicable amendments, will be issued electronically, the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidder's mailing list.  If the Government makes the decision to proceed to the follow-on Technology Development (TD) phase, there will be separate TD contracts awarded based on full and open competition.
AMDR is envisioned as a radar suite designed to be scalable to accommodate current and future mission requirements for multiple platforms. AMDR will consist of an S-band radar (AMDR-S), an X-band radar (AMDR-X) and a Radar Suite Controller (RSC).  The AMDR-S will provide volume search, tracking, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) discrimination, and missile communications.  The AMDR-X will provide horizon search, precision tracking, missile communication and terminal illumination. Both radars will be integrated into a suite by the RSC.  The RSC will provide the appropriate interfaces between the AMDR-S, AMDR-X, and combat system.  The RSC will perform all coordinating actions to ensure that both radars operate in concert in a widely diverse environment.  This solicitation will only address the AMDR-S and RSC requirements.
IMPORTANT:  In order to be considered for contract award, each company must have a TOP SECRET facility clearance and must be a United States (US) company or an independent US subsidiary.  However, foreign contractors may act as subcontractors to U.S. primes contractors.  The export of defense articles, defense services, and related technical data is subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and requires the issuance of an export license by the U.S. Department of State. 
There will be classified attachments at the SECRET/US Only level to the solicitation.  These classified documents will be supplied on a CD-ROM which will be mailed separately.  Only one copy of the classified CD-ROM will be distributed per cleared pre-solicitation notice respondent.  To obtain these classified attachments, interested offerors must completely fill out the "Classified Material Request Form" which is attached to this pre-solicitation notice.  This information should be submitted to Brian Wessmiller via e-mail at brian.wessmiller@navy.mil with a copy to richelle.wright@navy.mil.  Once approved, the Government will be able to mail a classified CD to the respondent if a solicitation is issued.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to solicit for Instructor/Operator, related scheduling and administrative support services for simulator and classroom based Navigation, Seamanship and Shiphandling (NSS) Training at Surface Warfare Officer's School (SWOS) Command.  These services will be accomplished through a modification under the existing Purchase Order N00189-08-P-Z432 that will extend the performance period for 2-months covering the period of 01 May 2009 through 30 June 2009 and will include provisions for a 1-month option period.  The extension is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (Global Maritime and Transportation School (GMATS), 300 Steamboat Road, Great Neck, New York, 11024-1634), under the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FA! R 13.501(a).  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 611519, and the applicable size standard of $6.5M.  The competitive follow-on acquisition is ongoing.  The course of the competitive procurement process necessitates additional time for completion. An extension of the existing order is required in order to avoid a break in services while affording sufficient time to complete the procurement process, award the follow-on contract and allow for a 30 day phase in period.  GMATS, as incumbent under Purchase Order N00189-08-P-Z432, is the only known source that has the contract workforce in place to continue performance of the services without interruption, while the competitive follow-on procurement is completed.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all bids, proposals, or quotations recei! ved by the closing response date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received would normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  However, a competitive follow-on acquisition under solicitation N00189-09-R-Z002 is in progress.  The Government will not pay for information received.  Responses to this synopsis should be mailed to the attention of Ms. Kristi Brown, Code 270.1C, FISC Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia Office, 700 Robbins Ave., Bldg. 2B, Phila., PA 19111-5083.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Government requires 35 secure parking spaces, 54 designated parking spaces, and 15 visitor parking spaces, along with sufficient parking to satisfy the needs of 176 employees.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & Lethality ContractingCenter, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 intends to issue an Invitation for Sealed Bids for the production of the M795 Shock Attenuating Lifting Plug.  It is the intention of the Government that the procurement shall be open to three small businesses (Medico Industries Inc., PA; Coronet Machinery, NY and J&M Machine Products, Inc., MI) that have a proven capability to produce lifting plugs. The Invitation for Sealed Bids is intended to be issued under restricted competition using 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B), Only One Responsible Source. The intended contract will be for a firm fixed price effort for one production year.  The intended quantity for this procurement is 100,000 each M795 Shock Attenuating Lifting Plugs with delivery beginning 90 days after contract award at a monthly delivery rate of 10,000 each.  The 155mm, HE, M795 Projectile is comprised of three components: the Shell Body, the Wooden Pallet, and the Shock Attenuating Lifting Plug. The Shock Attenuating Lifting Plug is installed for transportation and handling purposes in the 155mm, HE, M795.  Before firing, the plug is removed and a detonating fuse is installed in the nose of the projectile.  The lifting plug acts as a shock absorber in the critical nose area of the projectile where high stress may occur.  The plug has the design capability of bending under low stresses and breaking if the stresses become too high.  Under high stress, the lifting plug will shear in a way that will prevent the fuse from being installed.  The Shock Attenuating Lifting Plug renders the projectile safe and unusable if it is inadvertently subjected to a drop on its nose that exceeds design limits.  The Lifting Plug is made from malleable iron casting (i.e. ASTM A47 or ASTM A602), with a 2.000-12 UNS thread, a flange diameter of approximately 3.80 inches and an outer loop diameter of approximately 1.80 inches. Funds are available for this acquisition.  It is the intention of the Government that the Invitation for Sealed Bids, which will address a requirement to produce the M795 Shock Attenuating Lifting Plug, will be released within 15 days of the release of this synopsis.

<DESC>1.  The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC)/Army Strategic Command (ARSTRAT) intends to solicit and award a competitive 8(a) award to a single source through a hybrid firm-fixed price (FFP) type contract with Time-and-Materials and Cost Reimbursement CLINs for Fort Greely Alaska (FGA) Base Operations Support (BOS).  The Cost Reimbursement CLIN will be available for other supplies, training and travel requirements.  The RFP will be requesting the offerors bid known supplies, training and travel as part of their proposed costs, so this CLIN will only be used on a limited basis.  This procurement is a follow-on to the current sole source 8(a) award CPFF IDIQ contract for the FGA BOS which expires on September 30, 2009. The contract will support Fort Greely Alaska Garrison and agencies which collaborate with them on base support and missions in support of the warfighter.  USASMDC/ARSTRAT anticipates that one contract will be competitively awarded as a result of this 100% 8(a) set-aside. The resultant contract will have the capacity to provide base operation support to FGA and their tenants and shall support the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements, which include, but are not limited to:  MDA Lodging and Housekeeping, Fire Alarm Maintenance, Custodial, Indoor and Outdoor Pest Control, Access Control Services for MDC, Environmental, Engineering, Refuse Removal Transport and Disposal, MDA Facilities Maintenance, and Visitors Center.  Offerors will not bid on the draft PWS at this time. PWS Chapters 15  30 services are slated to be in-sourced with Department of Army Civilians.  If transition plan is delayed, the Contractor may be requested to provide these services to be determined.  The Contractor will not provide costs for these transition services in the final solicitation.  These chapters are merely for scope purposes, should the services be necessary.  The transition services are:  Automation and Network Support, Human Resources Support, Food Services, Logistic Support, Centralized Dispatch, Resource Management Administrative and Analyst, Single Soldier Housing (SSH) Support, Safety Operations Support, Snow Removal, Grounds Maintenance, Allen Army Airfield Operations and Services, Facilities Support/Service Order Repair (Garrison), Religious Support, Garrison Protocol Support, Strategic Planning Support, and Directorate of Public Works Business Operations.  When posted, the draft PWS, draft solicitation, applicable attachments and exhibits, and other historical FGA BOS documents and related information will be posted to Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI). An initial round of one-on-one meetings were held with industry on February 3 and 4, 2009. These one-on-one meetings were held as a market research mechanism to help determine best commercial practices, to maximize competition, and achievement of cost efficiencies in the acquisition process. Questions and answers related to the one-on-one sessions and the draft PWS were not posted or released; however, recommendations that the Government considered relevant were incorporated into the solicitation. A draft solicitation and associated supporting documents will be posted to FedBizOps in a follow-on notice. At that time industry will be provided the opportunity to review the draft documents and specific instructions for providing comments/feedback. The final RFP will be posted to the ASFI after consideration and incorporation of relevant feedback/comments. All interested parties are encouraged to regularly monitor the website for all pertinent acquisition information ASFI will be the only official means for FGA BOS information dissemination. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 561210 and the small business size standard $35.5M. The resultant contract will establish a basic and six one-year ordering periods starting on September 30, 2009 and ending on September 30, 2016.<BR><BR>2. Draft solicitation W91260-09-R-0001 is posted, with attachments, for industry review.

<SUBJECT>Project Tracking System (PTS) - Office of Comptroller
<SOLNBR>Tcc-09-HQ-CCOPTS
<RESPDATE>042009
<CONTACT>Azita Mamdouhi, Contract Specialist, Phone 2028744639, Email azita.mamdouhi@occ.treas.gov - Andrea  Katz, Contract Specialist, Phone 2028749933, Email andrea.katz@occ.treas.gov
<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issues this Sources Sought Synopsis to identify potential sources who are interested in and capable of providing the information technology services described herein. 

Business Need
Currently the Project Tracking System (PTS) is the primary tool used by the Chief Counsel’s Office (CCO) to track and report significant work, projects, and matters within the responsibility of the Chief Counsel. The current system was built in Lotus Notes.  CCO seeks to replace it with a system that is easier to use for inputting information and more flexible in providing information to managers. The desired solution will provide easier data entry, more consistency, reduced redundancies/errors, improved reporting, and overall better tracking and management of CCO projects including matters, tasks, work and resources. 
In many government and commercial enterprises, OCC’s PTS would be referred to as a case management system or a matter management system. In this document the terms “project” and “matter” are used interchangeably.
CCO is comprised of the Law, Licensing, and Community Affairs Departments with staff located in Washington, DC (HQ) and four district offices. There would be approximately OCC 250 users of the system although users may be of different types (e.g., heavy vs. occasional).
The OCC seeks interested vendors and contractors who are capable of implementing a new system to track and manage all work, projects, activities, and matters within CCO.
System Requirements
Final requirements are under development but the overall scope of the desired system includes: 

-  Features to allow CCO employees to standardize the process of entering, tracking, and updating their projects and matters, leading to more consistency, less duplication, and reduced errors. 

-  Well-designed reporting functionality including standard reports and the capability for users to create and run ad-hoc reports.

-  An interactive dashboard for listing and presenting matters according to user-defined criteria, with drill-down capabilities for greater visibility into the details and history of high-priority and specially designated activities, allowing first-level and senior management to better manage their portfolios of resources and tasks. 

-  Workflow, business process management or similar capabilities to improve communication and collaboration on matters, especially as between CCO managers/executives and their direct reports, including various methods to summarize and relay status information through configurable alerts and notifications or well-designed information displays.

-  Native document management capabilities and/or an established application programming interface for integrating with leading document management systems (key requirement is to associate documents with projects/matters).

-  Support for interfacing with other modern systems, such as the Central Application Tracking System as described in FedBizOps Solicitation Number CC-09-HQ-R-0038.  

-  Docketing and calendaring functions including tasks tied to matters/projects, task dates, task types, and options to set up task sequencing per templates or models keyed to matter types.

-  Robust core functionality for defining projects/matters, project types, people, assignments of people to matters including dates and duration of assignments, designation of specific roles (e.g. primary responsible vs. other roles) for people on specified matters, and structured data for status flags in matters.

-  Robust configuration capability to support (a) screen design, field additions and field labeling without custom programming and (b) disciplined method of preserving data structures and user interfaces common to all users while allowing for some group-specific configuration.
-  Capability to support textual status descriptions “inside” the project tracking system (in addition to a capability to associate documents to matters), such that monthly or other periodic reporting can be performed on status that includes presentation of status text in accordance with user-specified criteria.

-	Capability to output PTS data and text to tools such as Microsoft Word and Excel.

-	A data model that is, or can be developed to be, easily analyzed and researched for purposes of understanding data relationships vital to reporting capabilities.

-	 A security model that provides different levels of access to system data and functions based upon defined roles and access privileges.

-	 Modern application architecture and user interface design that is extensible and friendly to integrations, especially in regard to Microsoft products including Microsoft Office/Outlook, Active Directory, etc.

-	 Capability to allow CCO staff to record their time in a matter-specific fashion using a convenient interface (e.g., portal-style access to functions is a possible approach); and an associated capability to report this data in various ways and/or to output the data to other systems.

-	 Compliance with Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) policy with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.

<SUBJECT>Sources Sought for Iraq Hazardous Waste (HW) Retrograde to CONUS
<SOLNBR>SP4500-09-S-0001
<RESPDATE>041709
<CONTACT>Tracy M. Hart, Supervisory Contracting Officer, Phone 269-961-4762, Email tracy.hart@dla.mil
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT FOR IRAQ HW RETROGRADE TO CONUS

NOTICE TYPE:  Sources Sought

SYNOPSIS:  The DRMS is exploring a variety of alternatives for the disposal of DoD hazardous waste items currently located in Iraq.  As one possible alternative, this Sources Sought is for the purposes of identifying sources capable of handling a large scale retrograde requirement consisting of an estimated 11 million pounds of hazardous waste generated by the DoD in Iraq.  A retrograde is defined as the return of U.S. made, generated and/or procured property from an overseas U.S. military Port of Embarkation (PoE).  The waste would be transported by the DoD to a few selected military Ports of Debarkation (PoD) located on the United States’ East or Gulf Coasts (the U.S. Government would arrange and obtain the ocean going transportation).  Should this alternative be realized, the anticipated end result be a five-year firm fixed priced contract with a guaranteed minimum.  It’s projected that a large, initial shipment(s) would be retrograded that could consist of an estimated 750 military 20-foot sea van containers being simultaneously offloaded into single or multiple military PoDs.  After the initial shipment it’s anticipated that an estimated 50-70 sea van containers with additional waste would require removal and disposal services each year during the life of the contract at various intervals.  The waste would be containerized and shipped by the U.S. Government in accordance with International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code, Department of Transportation standards and all other applicable Codes, Treaties, etc.  The U.S. Government would coordinate and obtain all required clearances.  It’s anticipated that the U.S. Government would offload and reload the containers at the PoDs and may possibly provide transportation of the waste from the PoDs to the contractor’s interim storage facility and/or designated Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility (TSDF).   The contractor would be responsible for but not limited to performing the following types of management services:

Prior to departure from PoE:

•  Dispatching field team to Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) Al Assad and Joint Base Balad, Iraq, to facilitate preparation of shipping documentation prior to containers being sealed for transport to the Port of Umn Qasr, Iraq (Note:  This would not include any requirement for contractor provided containers, analytical testing, labpacking, containerization, in-country transportation or loading services).

Upon arrival at U.S. military PoDs:

•  Verifying shipments against stated inventories
•  Repackaging any items possibly loosened during shipment 
•  Completing waste profiles and required manifests and/or other shipping documentation
•  Arranging for interim storage of the waste, if necessary
•	Disposing of the waste at qualified TSDFs

All services must be completed in accordance with all Federal, State and local laws and regulations.  

Forms of waste would include but is not limited to:

•  A variety of used and unused batteries (including lithium)
•  Solvents
•  Decontaminate agents and kits
•  Solid waste containing heavy metals
•  Mercury and mercury containing items
•  Pesticides/herbicides/fungicides/insecticides
•  Waste oil and fuel
•  Grease
•  PoL contaminated solids 
•  Filters
•  Aerosol cans and other compressed gas cylinders
•  Asbestos items
•  Fire extinguishing residue
•  Uncontrolled medicine
•  Ethylene Glycol
•  Spill residue
•  Empty containers that previously held hazardous contents

The contractor would have at a minimum, a 30-day window from the time a funded task order is issued until the waste arrived at selected U.S. military PoD(s).  Currently, the contractor would have only 96-hours to perform required management services at the PoDs once the waste is made available for removal.

The purpose of this request for information is twofold:  1) To identify the feasibility of such a contract, given the potential concerns and difficulties that could be encountered when managing ultimate disposal of a large volume of hazardous waste; and 2) To identify the capability and interest of firms for inclusion on a potential source list.

If a solicitation is pursued, the offeror would be required to submit past performance information depicting comparable experience and provide a sound logistics and management plan outlining how they would perform waste disposal services for a requirement of this magnitude.  This would include but is not limited to the use of proper equipment and qualified staffing, proof of adequate financial resources and insurance and identification of acceptable subcontractors.   If subcontractors would be used the offeror would be required to identify the sources and provide written proof of a working relationship between the parties.   The offeror would also be required to clearly show that the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation’s Limitation on Subcontracting, FAR 52.219-14 would be met. 

This Sources Sought is issued solely for information and planning purposes only – there is no actual requirement or any further information available at this time.  DRMS is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement.  The Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this Source Sought.  All costs associated with responding to this Sources Sought will be solely at the responding party’s expense.  All information received in response to this Sources Sought that is marked proprietary information will be handled accordingly.  
Firms with capability and interest are encouraged to reply via e-mail.  All information submitted will be reviewed but DRMS may not respond to any submissions.  Information and/or queries must be e-mailed to the attention of Tracy M. Hart, Senior Contracting Officer, at tracy.hart@dla.mil, not later than 4:30 p.m. EST, April 17, 2009.

BACKGROUND

Within the U.S. Department of Transportation, the FHWA has lead responsibility for the National Scenic Byways Program.  The Program is a grassroots, collaborative effort established to help recognize, preserve and enhance selected roads throughout the United States. The Secretary of Transportation recognizes certain roads as America’s Byways® – All-American Roads or National Scenic Byways – based on one or more archaeological, cultural, historic, natural, recreational and scenic intrinsic qualities.

The law guiding implementation of the National Scenic Byways Program is Section 162, Title 23 of the United States Code; 23 U.S.C. 162, see http://www.bywaysonline.org/program/us_code.html.  The FHWA established the principal policy for the Program in its May 18, 1995 Interim Policy (60 FR 26759), see http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=1995_register&docid=fr18my95-105.

Under the National Scenic Byways Program, the Secretary of Transportation designates roads having outstanding qualities as National Scenic Byways or All-American Roads.  There are 125 nationally designated byways – 98 National Scenic Byways and 27 All-American Roads in 44 States.  

Nominations may originate from any local government, including Indian tribal governments, or any private group or individual.  Nominations to the National Scenic Byways Program of byways on public lands may originate from the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, or the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  Nominations must be submitted to the FHWA by a State, an Indian tribe, or a Federal land management agency. 

The Secretary of Transportation makes grants to States and Indian tribes to implement projects on highways designated as National Scenic Byways or All-American Roads, or as State or Indian tribe scenic byways.  Projects submitted for consideration should benefit the byway traveler’s experience, whether it will help manage the intrinsic qualities that support the byway’s designation, shape the byway’s story, interpret the story for visitors, or improve visitor facilities along the byway.

The FHWA maintains two websites under the National Scenic Byways Program.  The FHWA’s National Scenic Byways Program website, www.bywaysonline.org is the principal medium for doing program business, as well as a primary medium for the FHWA to communicate to the byway community.  FHWA’s website at www.byways.org is a major medium for the FHWA’s promotion of the collection of National Scenic Byways and All-American Roads as America’s Byways®.

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FNS-09-0147 2 APRIL 2009</p>
<p>AGENCY: USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)</p>
<p>TITLE: Consulting Services for State Agency Systems (COSSAS)</p>
<p>1. This is an RFI notice only. USDA FNS is contemplating awarding Multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements for commercial services pertaining to Consulting Services for State Agency Systems. A subsequent RFP may follow, however is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>2. Procurement Plan. FNS is seeking market information from qualified, experienced and interested vendors on its proposed acquisition strategy (Attachment 1) for Consulting Services for State Agency Systems (COSSAS). FNS is also seeking comments on the contemplated Statement of Objectives (SOO) for COSSAS (see Attachment 2). For the purpose of this procurement, Consulting Services are intended to provide technical advice to FNS and State agencies in support of information systems used to determine program eligibility and issue program benefits for two FNS programs: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). Examples of potential upcoming tasks are included in Attachment 3: Examples of Potential Needs for FYs 2009-2010.</p>
<p>FNS is planning to solicit proposals for award of a 5-year Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for technical consulting and support services. The purpose of the BPA is to establish a procurement vehicle that will meet FNS' need to acquire technical expertise in three areas: Data Analysis, Technical Writing, and Technical Support. Along with each of these areas, it is very important each vendor have a high level of reporting and management capabilities. FNS expects to qualify multiple contractors for award under multiple individual BPAs. Contractors may submit proposals and be qualified under one, two, or all three of the areas of technical expertise. Individual Task Orders will be placed either on a competitive basis among the qualified firms, or on a sole source basis upon the determination that competition is limited based on expertise in a specific subject area or if other BPA holders are ineligible due to a conflict of interest. Since the technical services will provide assistance to FNS and our State agencies, contractors may not provide services on the same project to both FNS and individual State agencies separately. Potential organizational and personal conflicts of interest must be addressed for each Task Order.</p>

Notice of Solicitation of Submissions for Contractor Pre-Qualification

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is requesting submissions to pre-qualify firms for construction services for the partial renovation and upgrade of the existing facilities at the U. S. Embassy in Rome, Italy.  The renovation will include the Marine Security Guard Quarters (MSGQ) and the multi-purpose room located on the Embassy Rome compound in the Sembler building.  This construction project will complete the MSGQ construction and the multi-purpose room improvements.

The original U.S. government-owned, 4-acre and buildings were acquired by the Department in 1946.  Portions of the 12,700 gsm chancery were constructed in the 1600s.  The twin consular and public diplomacy buildings each contain 2,500 gsm of floor space.  An additional parcel and office space were acquired and added to the compound in FY 2003.  The building was designed in 1927 for the INA Insurance Company and was occupied by the company until the sale.  Its 2 ½ acre trapezoidal site forms a natural corner to our embassy compound and brings the total compound size to 6.5 acres.

Project Description:  
Security Clearance is NOT Required

SAQMMA-09-R0074 Rome, Italy– Complete the MSGQ construction and the multi-purpose room improvements.  Estimated construction cost is $2 to $5 million.

<DESC>Notice of Solicitation of Submissions for Contractor Pre-Qualification

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is requesting submissions to pre-qualify firms for construction services for replacing the entire plumbing system in the historical U.S. Government owned Ambassador’s residence, known as Bosch Palace.  The proposed replacement shall comprise replacing the existing potable (hot and cold), sanitary waste, hot water (heating) and rain leader piping.  In addition, there shall be mechanical upgrades to the HVAC system to include a new Air Handling Unit, HVAC controls work, etc.

The residence of the U.S. Ambassador to Argentina, also known as the Bosch Palace (El Palacio Bosch), was built in 1911 by Ernesto Bosch, an Argentine Ambassador to France.  While in Paris, Mr. Bosch commissioned architect Rene Sergent (1865-1927) to design an archetypal diplomatic residence for Buenos Aires in the French classical style.  In 1929, Robert Woods Bliss, the U.S. Ambassador to Argentina, purchased the house for use as the Embassy Main Residence (EMR).  Today, it is a major Buenos Aires landmark and an important U.S. representational facility.  It is considered a prime symbol of the relationship between the two countries.  The Bosch Palace has a gross area of approximately 3,700 square meters.     

Project Description:  
(Security Clearance is NOT Required)

SAQMMA -09-R0147 Buenos Aires, Argentina – Plumbing and Hot Water Heating Piping Replacement and Mechanical upgrades to the HVAC system:  Estimated construction cost is $500,000 to $1 Million. 

Acquisition Phase I – Pre-Qualification of Offerors
This announcement of solicitation of pre-qualification submissions is Phase I.  DOS will evaluate and rate the pre-qualification submissions based on the procedure and evaluation criteria set forth below.  DOS may refuse to pre-qualify any Offeror receiving less than a satisfactory rating on any evaluation factor or sub-factor.

Acquisition Phase II – Requests for Proposals from Pre-Qualified Offerors
Those Offerors determined to be pre-qualified in accordance with this notice will be issued a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) for the project and invited to submit proposed pricing in Phase II.  The RFP will include a statement of work, final design documents and outline specifications that set out the project scope, construction process, post-construction activities; unique site constraints and requirements for maintaining security and operations during construction. 

The contract will be “firm-fixed-price.”  Construction services will include providing construction labor and materials to execute the OBO-provided design; on-site organization with management to ensure overall project coordination; and overall control throughout the life of the project.  Required services include preparation of construction documents, quality control plans, safety plans, project schedules, cost estimates, and project close-out activities.

Due to time constraints, DOS anticipates that the pre-qualified Offerors will be required to participate in a visit to the project site within 10 to 15 days after the issuance of the RFP.  To offset some of the cost of the site visit and other related costs, pre-qualified Offerors that do not receive the construction contract award will be paid $5,000.00 for responsive project proposals they submit in Phase II.

<DESC>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) is the Armys medical materiel developer and logistician.  Under this command structure, the MRMC has a number of institutes that conduct laboratory research science.  The laboratory notebook is the primary document for planning and recording of data generated in the laboratory, consequently the proper maintenance of a laboratory notebook is an essential requirement for conducting research.  However, the traditional paper laboratory notebook has become inefficient and ineffective for storage of all forms of data being collected in the modern research laboratory. This situation has fueled the development of software programs that can be termed an Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN) and are designed to completely replace paper forms of record keeping.  ELN software available today features single entry of data from a wide range of electronic sources and storage of that data in a fully documented, patent compliant, retrievable form in an electronic database.  This document details the requirements for ELNs to be used in the USAMRMC discovery research laboratories and the process to be used to evaluate vendors and vendors ELN applications for implementation into these laboratories.<BR><BR>1.0	  PURPOSE AND SCOPE<BR>1.1	 Purpose<BR>The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) is the Armys medical materiel developer and logistician. The command has four major Core Capabilities:<BR><BR>"	Shape future medical solutions through research, advanced technology, and partnerships<BR>"	Execute streamlined medical logistics, facilities and acquisition management<BR>"	Develop, integrate, acquire and sustain medical IM/IT solutions<BR>"	Provide best business practices and program management solutions<BR><BR>The USAMRMC is the executive or lead agency responsible for:<BR>"	The Medical Chemical and Biological Defense Research Program (MCBDRP)<BR>"	Military Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) R&D Program (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS))<BR>"	Military Infectious Diseases Research Program (MIDRP)<BR>"	Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (GEIS)<BR>"	Use of Investigational New Drugs for Force Health Protection<BR>"	DoD Food and Nutrition Research, Development, Test, Evaluation, and Engineering Program<BR>"	Combat Dentistry Research Program<BR>"	Gulf War Illnesses/Force Health Protection Research Program<BR>"	Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program (PRMRP)<BR><BR>The USAMRMC conducts laboratory research at the following institutions<BR>"	U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).<BR>"	Walter Reed Army Institute for Research (WRAIR).<BR>"	U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Chemical Defense (USAMRICD).<BR>"	U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM)<BR>"	U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR)<BR>"	U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratories (USAARL)<BR>"	U.S.Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR)<BR><BR><BR>1.2  Scope<BR><BR>This Requirements Specification document is provided to the system owner (MRMC) as a high level statement of what the ELN must do, as defined by the unique user populations requiring a laboratory notebook record.  This document will allow selection of a information technology capability which best meets the requirements. Although this document addresses several technical configuration requirements of the ELN, it concentrates on the business needs of the USAMRMC at this time.<BR><BR>Maintaining a laboratory notebook is a necessary requirement for conducting experimental science.  It is the primary document for planning and recording of data generated in the laboratory, it is the source of stored information for retrieval of data generated over time, and it is the primary document used to support a patent position in court or in an administrative proceeding before the U.S. Patent & Trademarks Office.  Consequently the proper maintenance of a laboratory notebook is an essential requirement for conducting research, replicating and validating results, and securing proper recognition for our scientific accomplishments.<BR><BR>This requirement is recognized by all investigators working in a research laboratory and investigators are trained in the proper method of maintaining a bound paper notebook.  Such notebooks are issued by the institute, are the property of the institute, and are returned to the institute upon completion.  Command and Institute policies as well as requirements to protect Intellectual property entail that paper notebook pages be numbered, that each page is signed and dated by the investigator, and that each page is counter signed and dated by an individual, not involved with the project, who is familiar with the technology and experimental approach.<BR><BR>However, over the past two to three decades it has become increasingly evident that the bound paper notebook record cannot be inclusive when recording data in a modern biological and/or chemical laboratory.  The data being collected is in diverse formats and some formats cannot be easily stored in a bound paper notebook.  Examples include films showing radioactive images, an array of readouts from a variety (e.g. liquid and gas columns; stained and dried acrylamide gels; film and paper imaging) of chromatographic apparatus, animal telemetry readouts, databanks of information generated by projects involving nucleic acid sequence analysis, and screening data of chemical compound libraries.   Due to their size or fragility, many of these sources of data require a storage location other than a notebook, incurring difficulties in documentation, storage location, and data retrieval. Bound paper notebooks require the attachment of printed copies of any electronic documents or images generated during laboratory data collection. <BR><BR>Consequently, the paper notebook has become an inefficient and insufficient method of storing data.  This fact is now better appreciated throughout the research and legal community and the long standing requirement for a bound paper laboratory notebook record for documenting intellectual property has been questioned. With the development of computer software for compiling all forms of electronic data, and with the acceptance of electronic signatures on most legal documents, the U.S., European, and world-wide patent offices have stated that electronic data, if properly stored and annotated, will be permitted as evidence in support of an intellectual property position (para 4.1).<BR><BR>2.0	BUSINESS OBJECTIVE<BR><BR>To evaluate the present status of ELNs for the chemical, biological, and medical research laboratories and determine if one or more can be implemented for use in the wider-range of MRMC laboratories, the following business questions must be addressed:<BR><BR><BR>2.1	General<BR>2.1.1	The System must interface with an Oracle database.<BR>2.1.2	 The System must be fully compatible with Microsoft programs using either the Windows or Apple platform.<BR>2.1.3	 The System must be accessed by CAC based security or by password based security when CAC access is not available.<BR>2.1.4	 The System must be able to track/retrieve key information such as project name, author, experimental method, date, and other keywords.<BR>2.1.5	 The System must have a capacity to lock-down data with a date-time stamp (version control).<BR>2.1.6	The System must maintain integrity of stored data, which cannot be compromised for at least 30 years (para 4.2).<BR>2.1.7	The System should have flexibility in supporting unstructured journal style information recording and allow user to revise the notes easily.<BR>2.1.8	The System should support handwriting recognition and content storage as both image and text.<BR>2.1.9	The System should support bidirectional data exchange integration with other data systems.<BR>2.1.10	The System must be web-based to facilitate remote access from within laboratory suites, access across command laboratories, and require no additional software (e.g.  ActiveX, or Citrix).<BR>2.1.11	The System should be able to accept data from a Tablet PC, PDA, or other commonly used electronic communication devices.<BR>2.1.12	The System must have automatic or passive save page feature.<BR>2.1.13	The System should accommodate the use of Internet Explorer, Safari, and FireFox browsers.<BR>2.1.14	The System must be able to attach/embed high content data formats not limited to the following file extensions: gif, xls, txt, ppt, pzf, doc, png, and pdf.<BR>2.1.15	The System must be able to use English as the primary language.<BR>2.1.16	The System should have capability to produce output in PDF format.<BR>2.1.17	The System must allow real-time data access.<BR>2.1.18	The System should allow users to add data as it is available, not full page by full page (i.e. not require completion of a page prior to moving forward).<BR>2.1.19	The System should be, at a minimum, Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) compliant.<BR>2.1.20	The system should have a single screen that summarizes the open work tasks for each user.<BR>2.1.21	The System must utilize electronic signature of both notebook author and a second user witness (para 4.1).<BR>2.1.22	The System must be compliant with Section 508 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act (amended 1998) (para 4.3).<BR>2.1.23	The System should provide online help and be accessible to the system users.<BR>2.2	Data<BR>2.2.1	The System must accommodate notebooks with an unlimited number of pages.<BR>2.2.2	The System should allow for meta-data fields on files for exportation.<BR>2.3	Security and Regulatory Compliance<BR>2.3.1	The System should not leave information in the local machines cache, nor leave cookies on the local machine when in offline mode.<BR>2.3.2	The System must be compliant with U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 part 11 to include: secure, computer generated, time-stamped audit trail recording operator entries and actions that create, modify or delete electronic records;

<DESC><p>This Special Notice announces the Government's intention to award a sole-source task order under Contract No. FA2550-05-D-8000 (Milstar Engineering Communications Services Support - MECSS) to the contractor currently performing the effort (LinQuest Corp.).&nbsp; <strong>The proposed period of performance is 16 July 2009 through 15 April 2010 to ensure continuation of critical Milstar technical support while a follow-on source selection is in progress.</strong></p>
<p>This effort will encompass all areas of global satellite communications necessary to support the joint Milstar mission to include planning and monitoring of Strategic, Cryptographic, and Tactical areas of operation as well as real-time communications troubleshooting, apportionment enforcement, and payload resource trending.&nbsp; The support effort may include, but is not limited to strategic planning for evolving space technologies; development and integration of technology developments with future Milstar needs; identification and integration of cooperative requirements and technology planning with other space technology development centers.</p>
<p><strong>Areas of Qualifications/Capabilities</strong></p>
<p>Respondents must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the Milstar system and the 4th Space Operations Squadron (4 SOPS) &amp; 614th Space Communications Squadron (614 SCS)&nbsp;mission. Core personnel must have a thorough understanding and extensive background in Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, and joint deployment and tactics, as well as EHF terminal operations. This understanding is necessary for active participation in the 4 SOPS System Anomaly Resolution Team activities. The support requires an in-depth knowledge of Milstar EHF systems, communications operations, theater CONOPS, as well as a high level of expertise in network resource planning using the Milstar Communications Planning Tool-integrated (MCPT-i) and resource monitoring using MCPT-i and the Automated Communications Management System (ACMS).</p>
<p>A high degree of EHF satellite planning expertise is required to rapidly analyze new communications requirements, assess system and user impacts, and present well thought out options for the 50 SW and 14th Air Force Leadership, the EHF SATCOM Operational Manager, and/or the Joint Staff. Support must reflect a high degree of expertise in developing apportionment plans for the Milstar strategic community and experience in all levels of planning from peacetime to wartime scenarios.</p>
<p>Expertise in efficiently configuring constellation payload tables, developing terminal images for all EHF terminals, and experience in user data flow is mandatory. The effort involves detailed troubleshooting of user problems using Milstar Communications Asset Monitoring (CAM) data to identify and rapidly resolve communications related problems affecting Milstar users.</p>
<p>Expert support is required to plan, build, and manage the installation of Over-The-Air-Re-key tables for all terminals using the Milstar system and assisting in the operational activation of Key Authorization Tables. Support would be required to visit service key managers to reconcile 4 SOPS planning databases with those being used to distribute keys to active users.</p>
<p>Support personnel will analyze Satellite Authorization Requests/Approvals (SAR/SAA) submitted by military planners, prepare network activation schedules for 4 SOPS's 24-hour crews, distribute network communications plans, and provide real-time feedback of communications plans to Milstar managers.</p>
<p>Support personnel will interact with Unified Combatant Command and Joint Staff communications planners to ensure optimum 4 SOPS support is provided for exercise and contingency operations. Support involves daily analysis of all active Low Data Rate (LDR) and Medium Data Rate (MDR) communications services-constellation wide-and the preparation and distribution of daily user advisory reports to the war fighters outlining payload usage inefficiencies, services violating constellation usage directives, and addressing issues of concern to the user community.</p>
<p>Support will require active participation in Tactical Network Implementation Planning (TNIP) meetings to address single and global user issues, formulate/advocate/coordinate system policies, demonstrate/explain/train new capabilities, and develop courses of action to resolve system level deficiencies affecting Milstar communications. Effort will also require the regular attendance at working groups where issues affecting the current Milstar communications mission and future 4 SOPS capabilities are discussed.</p>
<p>Support personnel must be proficient in Milstar theory and satellite communications planning in order to provide routine classroom instruction for Joint Staff, Unified Combatant Commanders, Global and Regional SATCOM Support Centers (G/RSSC), RSSC planners, 4 SOPS personnel, and the Milstar Management community at large. Monthly training must be provided for the 4 SOPS 24-hour crewmembers in all aspects of the communications mission and advanced network troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<p>Support personnel will be required to produce documents that must adhere to professional technical writing and editing styles, and may include, but are not limited to: technical background papers, satellite resource utilization reports, monthly activity reports, and explanations of the results of data analyses.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Support Features</strong></p>
<p>It is anticipated that the required support will include maintenance actions of the Milstar Communications Planning Tool, integrated (MCPT-i) software program as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
<p>The Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) System Sustainment Office (MSSO) performs integrated sustainment of military satellite communications systems. The MSSO performs a variety of sustainment activities, including system engineering and integration, configuration management (CM) and status accounting, security engineering, and specialty engineering services in support of operational MILSATCOM systems. The MSSO will assume the program management responsibility of Milstar Communications Planning Tool - interim (MCPT-i), as part of the Mission Planning Element (MPE) of the Milstar communications system.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of Required Services</strong></p>
<p>Technical services are required to support MCPT-i software maintenance, for emergency maintenance only. Respondents shall demonstrate the capability to respond to mission critical user Deficiency Reports (DRs), as directed by the MSSO.</p>

<p class="layout"><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p class="layout">The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Microsystems
Technology Office (MTO) is requesting information on novel research ideas and
approaches for developing a Power Skin technology. No funding has currently
been allocated to this effort, a Broad Agency Announcement and/or other
solicitation may or may not result from the findings of this RFI.</p>
<p class="layout">The vision of &ldquo;Power Skin&rdquo; is to explore an integrated solution
for lightweight structural material that provides its own day and night
power.<span>&nbsp; </span>The over arching goal is to
exploit innovative energy harvesting and storage technologies and integrate
them into a form factor that is essentially a thin monolithic sheet.<span>&nbsp; </span>The latter should be robust and have the
structural integrity to be used as an independent power source and,
simultaneously, serve as the structural material to build lightweight platforms
such as UAVs and other robots.<span>&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Power
Skin&rdquo; technology will enable a host of new applications that require flexible,
conformal, moldable, scalable, very thin and ultra lightweight power materials
in small to large form factors.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
technology offers future potential for high-throughput manufacturing processes
such as roll-to-roll fabrication.<span>&nbsp; </span>The objectives
of the &ldquo;Power Skin&rdquo; concept are three-fold:</p>

components into thin sheets and/or on a thin lightweight backing material for
structural integrity</p>
<p class="layout">As a notional scenario, the &ldquo;Power Skin&rdquo; development can be
framed as power material to be used in small UAVs to demonstrate continuous
flight for four days.<span>&nbsp; </span>The ultimate goal
is to develop a technology that will enable indefinite flight endurance.<span>&nbsp; </span>This RFI is seeking to find ideas and
possible metrics related to &ldquo;Power Skin&rdquo; for small UAVs.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, what are the minimum power
requirements for a micro/mini UAV to fly continuously for four days?<span>&nbsp; </span>The proposed approaches for energy harvesting
and storage must consider flexible, conformal, moldable and scalable designs in
a very thin and lightweight form-factor.<span>&nbsp; </span>The energy harvesting skin could be multi-modal in a layered or
laterally periodic design.<span>&nbsp; </span>The storage
skin could be a novel battery or other embodiment that directly stores the
energy from the energy harvesting skin and has the option to recharge from
available power source when not in use.</p>

<DESC>This notice is in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2, Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions.  The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement.  The purpose of this notice is to announce the intent to award a contract on a sole source basis to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.   The Minerals Management Service anticipates awarding a contract to the ADF&G for a study to monitor walrus behaviors, including paths of migration, movements between resting and feeding areas, social behavior, and use of habitat.  Specifically, this study requires that ADF&G empower Native hunters to instrument walrus and conduct surveys of haulouts near coastal villages.  Thus, a very high level of coordination between Federal and State agencies, and Native Subsistence Organizations and hunters is required to successfully complete this project, with an objective of only minimal impact on subsistence activities.
It is anticipated that this effort will continue for five years, with the first year funded in an amount of $300,000.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  This notice of intent is for informational purposes only.  However, any information received by the Point of Contact (POC) listed below, by close of business on Monday, April 20, 2009, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  POC: Debra Bridge, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS-2101, Herndon, VA 20170.  Any response must be emailed to debra.bridge@mms.gov.  PHONE CALLS ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

<a href="mailto:tracey.bissonnette-arambula@va.gov">Contracting Officer's email</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has awarded a sole source contract for a molecular biologist to complete skeletal muscle and blood assessments of tissue samples collected from heart failure patients and health controls to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.  A fixed price contract with a base of March 30, 2009 through September 30, 2009 with two (2) 1-year options was awarded.  It is the Government's belief that only Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) possessed the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation or a request for information; it is notice of a sole source contract award.JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALVA241-P-1148SKELETAL MUSCLE ANALYSISSOLE SOURCE AWARD1.	Identification of the service/department and the transaction/requisition #:Department Veterans Affairs, Boston Healthcare System, Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center, 150 South Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA  02130 Solicitation No:  VA-241-09-RQ-0019, Contract No:  VA241-P-11482.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:General requirements: Molecular biologist to complete skeletal muscle and blood assessments of tissues samples collected from heart failure patients and healthy controls. Assessments will include light microscopy as well as assessments of gene signaling patterns in the acquired human muscle biopsy samples.In particular, the molecular biologist must be qualified to complete highly specialized assessments of atrogenes (genes regulating proteolysis) as well as anabolic signaling patterns. Moreover, the molecular biologist must be disposed to work closely with Dr., in frequent meetings during data acquisition and throughout data analysis.This is a newly funded award that was specifically formulated and premised on the synergy of Dr. (principal investigator) and Dr. (co-investigator), incorporating novel analytic methods developed by Dr. in prior animal studies. Dr. played a key role in the development of this project, building upon and extending his seminal work in animals. The synergy created by the combination of Dr. and Dr. unique fields of expertise are felt to be major strengths of this study.In particular Dr. (and his staff) will be responsible for molecular assessment of muscle and blood samples collected in this study. Light microscopy will be used to complete histological analyses of tissue samples. Technically difficult and specialized real-time PCR techniques will be used to assess transcriptional patterns underlying the histological findings in these samples.The molecular assessments are especially novel, and constitute the basis of sole source contracting with Dr.. Genes regulating atrophy (atrogenes) will be identified as well as anabolic skeletal muscle transcriptional coactivators (PGC-1, and IGF-1). Dr. is uniquely qualified for these collaborations as he was one of the investigators that originally identified the concept of muscle atrogenes he has completed seminal research on atrogenes function (see below). He has also refined a systematic method of assessing atrogenes comprehensively and in aggregate with anabolic signaling patterns using real-time PCR techniques. Signaling assessments will include:1. Protein degeneration atrogenes: atrogin-1/MAFb, MuRF1, Polyubiquitin (UbB), E3a-II, proteasome subunits (PSMA1), cathepsin L.2 .Growth factors (molecular signaling related to growth): PGC-la, IGF-1, IGFBP5 , Fox01, TGFa, myostatin, follistatin, P311.3.	Structural atrogenes. MyHC, troponin I, Collagens (Co11A).4.	Metabolic atrogenes. enolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, glutamine synthase, creatine kinase, metallothionein.Dr. has been focused on issues of gene regulation in skeletal muscle for 12 years, and has published at length as this field (see below).Dr. will also regularly participate in acquisition and analysis of data, working closely with Dr. to correlate muscle biological indices to functional assessments completed by Dr.. Dr. will meet regularly with Dr. at the VA Jamaica Plain campus to achieve these objectives.3.	Description of the supplies/services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):To perform these analyses, Dr. will assess mRNA using real-time PCR techniques that are currently available and being utilized in his laboratory at BIDMC. Total skeletal muscle mRNA will be extracted from muscle biopsies using well established protocols. mRNA levels will be determined by real-time PCR using an Applied Biosystems OneStepPlus real-time PCR analyzer.For histological assessments, standard light microscopy techniques will be employed to analyze cross-sectional area of muscle fibers, as well as damage, inflammation, and atrophy. Histochemistry to differentiate type I and type II fibers will be performed (cytochrome C oxidase activity), and the histomorphometric and enzymatic features will be correlated to atrogenes expression, IGF-1, and PGC-la levels. Standard measures of aerobic enzymes (citrate synthase) will also be completed to establish additional correlations to molecular signaling patterns.Dr. also works proximately to the JP VA Boston Healthcare campus. He will work directly with Dr. as samples are collected and analyzed, and correlated to the comprehensive functional assessments that will be completed by Dr. at the VA campus. Dr. will regularly travel to the JP campus to achieve these objectives.4.	Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:FAR 6.302.1 Only one responsible source5.	Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:Dr. is a molecular biologist and nephrologist with a combined MD-PhD degree, based at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA. For the past twelve years, he has been involved in basic research to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie muscle atrophy and has identified both the atrogene network that will be measured in this study as well as being a co-discoverer of atrogin-1 itself. He has extensive experience measuring changes in gene expression of atrogenes in muscle tissue (see below).6.	Describe the efforts that have been made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:Dr. is uniquely qualified to complete these analyses. In the process of refining this project, Dr. discussed the techniques with several preeminent molecular biologists (at Duke University and University of Vermont, both major centers of skeletal muscle research), with all concurring that Dr. is uniquely suited to this investigation. Not only was his seminal work in atrogenes formative to this proposal, but Dr. has also refined the atrogene and anabolic gene transcription assessments that are critical in achieving the goals of this proposal. In fact, Dr. worked closely with Dr. as the generation of this proposal, and consequently, the proposal's methods are precisely those which Dr. has matured and advanced.7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:The Contracting Officer determined that the price proposed of $138,151.00 was fair and reasonable.	 8.	Description of the market survey that was conducted (i.e. names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:As mentioned in question 6, Dr. is uniquely qualified to complete the analyses required to achieve the goals of this proposal. Over the years in which this proposal matured, Dr. has discussed this proposal with several preeminent investigators in the field, particularly _____ and ______ (U of Vermont). These investigators specifically corroborated the unique aspects of the analyses of this proposal; work that only Dr. can perform. Based on the scientific merits of the study, Dr. is the right person to do the muscle analyses. The proposal builds on his seminal work, methods, and insights.9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation as to why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for competition have not been developed or are not available.This contracting activity seeks to maximize competition whenever possible.  However, Research requirements are often very specific and there is truly only one responsible source available to meet the Government's needs.  Seeking competition under these circumstances would serve no useful purpose.10. A Listing of the sources, if any, that expressed an interest in the acquisition:None to date11. A statement of the actions, if any, that the department/service may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies/services is required in the future: This acquisition is  truly a sole  source requirements and  there were  no barriers to competition to remove.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

DFAS 52.223-9000, “ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PRODUCTS” (OCT 2007)
The Environmentally Preferable Products clause is included in this contract to articulate the Government’s polices on Green Contracting.  FAR 23.403 sets forth the Federal Government’s policy to acquire items composed of the highest percentage of recycled-content practical, in a cost effective manner while still obtaining other contracting goals.  Recycled-content products are identified in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs).  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be producing a similar list which designates Bio-based products.  EPA guideline items (and USDA designated bio-based products, when designated) are seen as the minimum that should be considered when evaluating environmentally preferable materials.  Other environmentally preferable materials and products not listed, but commonly used in industry outside of the Government, should also be considered.  

The recently issued Executive Order 13423 (January 24, 2007) requires federal agencies to use sustainable environmental practices, including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products.  Moreover, it now requires that paper of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content must be acquired or used in Agency acquisitions of goods and services.  

§ 1.   Mandatory use of Paper and other products with recycled content.
(a) All paper utilized in the performance of this contract must be of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content.
(b) The contractor, by responding to this RFP/RFQ, affirmatively acknowledges that they will, to the maximum extent practicable, use sustainable environmental practices including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products in the performance of this contract that meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items, which are found at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm.   In addition, by responding to this RFQ/RFP the contractor is certifying the deliverables required under this contract shall meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items.   

§ 2   Notice of Green alternatives in Offerors’ product/service.
When offering a product or service that contains Green components as that term is defined at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm,
(a) the contractor shall make the Contracting Officer aware of such facts in the submission of their quote or proposal.  
(b)  The contractor, when appropriate, shall comply with FAR Clause 52.223-9 Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material Content for EPA Designated Products.

§ 2   Affirmative Duty of Contractors to adhere to Green Contracting Policy.  
(a) Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to examine its packaging to eliminate or reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable material for non-recyclable material in packaging.
(b)   Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to find other materials utilized in the delivery of services under this contract and examine whether it can reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable materials for non-recyclable materials of items consumed in the furnishing of their services.

DFAS 252.232-9000 “WIDE AREA WORK FLOW (WAWF) – RECEIPT AND ACCEPTANCE (RA) INSTRUCTIONS” (November 2007)
 (a) As prescribed in DFARS clause 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (March 2007), Contractors must submit payment requests in electronic form.  The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) has implemented the DoD sanctioned Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) for contractors to submit electronic payment requests and receiving reports.

<DESC><p>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR NOAA <br />Ground Systems STAR Collaborative Environment Data Backup System<br />DG133E-09-RP-0084
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) located in Silver Spring, MD is planning to procure a data backup system for STAR's Collaborative Environment central computing and data storage environment. STAR currently has 300 TB of data in the CE stored in four Network Attached Storage (NAS) systems. This storage is predicted to grow close to 1.5PB by FY14. These NAS systems utilize RAID configurations to guard against data loss. However, NOAA requires a system to back up this data, on and off site, for disaster recovery. NOAA estimates that a LTO-4 based tape library, with 10 tape drives, 2000 slots, and enterprise-level backup software, could meet this requirement. This action is a total small business set aside. The NAICS code for this action is 518210. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This action is issued as a request for proposal. The solicitation number is DG133E-09-RP-0084. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-31. This process is being conducted under the test procedures for the procurement of commercial items under the authority of FAR 13.5.</p>
<p>Requirements for NOAA NESDIS/STAR Data Backup System</p>
<p><br />Introduction</p>
<p>The NOAA NESDIS Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) has a requirement for a backup system to back up our existing and planned Network Attached Storage (NAS). The backup system must include all components, hardware, and software, necessary to perform these backups, and to manage these backups, and the backup system itself.</p>
<p>NOAA plans to use this backup system mostly for disaster recovery. NOAA requires the ability to restore individual files and directories as needed, but NOAA does not envision this to occur more than once per day.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>The current NAS consists of four separate Dell/EMC fibre channel NAS systems. NOAA will be adding more NAS systems over the next several years. These new NAS systems may not be Dell/EMC, and/or may not be fibre channel based. NOAA is considering iSCSI based NAS. See the diagram on the next page for a conceptual view of the planned configuration. The servers are almost all running Red Hat Enterprise Linux. One server is an IBM running AIX. There are plans for an additional AIX server. The other "half" of the environment on the existing Ethernet is Windows XP and Windows Server based.</p>
<p>There are two types of NAS data:<br />&bull; Large data sets which are static, or "static" but growing<br />&bull; Dynamic volumes holding constantly changing general purpose user files</p>
<p>The table below summarizes our estimated NAS capacity, in Terabytes. NOAA estimates the capacity by looking at the current NAS, how much it costs, how much funding expect to obtain each year for NAS, and assumes a 33% market increase per year in terms of capacity available per dollar. The shaded cells show refresh years. The dynamic NASes are noted. All others are considered to be in the static category.</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHED DOCUMENTS</p>
<p><br />Requirements</p>
<p>1. Backup of Static NAS<br />It is estimated that our static NAS will reach 1,352 TB by FY14. It requires the ability to hold 1,352 TB completely in the backup system. It is not needed to perform the back up of the entire 1,352 TB of static NAS at once. It can back up individual data sets periodically, perhaps once every 3 weeks, such that all static NAS files are held in the backup system, and none of those file copies in the backup system are more than 3 weeks old.</p>
<p>2. Backup of Dynamic NAS<br />It is estimated that the dynamic NAS will reach 120 TB by FY11 through FY15. Requiring the ability to hold that 120 TB completely in the backup system. With the capacity to completely back up this dynamic NAS once per week.</p>
<p>3. Compression<br />Assume 0% compression of STAR data between its state on STAR NAS, and its copies on the backup system.</p>
<p>4. Capabilities<br />Requires a detailed description of the hardware and software capabilities of the proposed back-up system.<br />This includes:<br />a. user interfaces<br />b. file and directory backup and restoration performance<br />c. data encryption capabilities<br />d. partitioning capabilities<br />e. access controls<br />f. full and incremental backup capabilities<br />g. maximum expandable capabilities</p>
<p>5. Delivery<br />Requires inside delivery to the system's location in the World Weather Building (WWB), 5200 Auth Rd, IT Room 501, Camp Springs, MD, 20746. The ultimate locations of the system will be in the NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction (NCWCP) in College Park, MD, but the construction of that building will not be complete until approximately November 2009 at the earliest.</p>
<p>6. Physical Dimensions<br />Include the physical dimensions of the proposed backup system. It must not be so large, heavy, or unwieldy, that it can not be delivered and operated at the locations listed above. The WWB elevator doors are 3'5" wide and 6'11" tall. The WWB elevators are 4'10" deep and 6'6" wide. The WWB elevators have a capacity of 3,000 lbs. The ramp to the IT room is 4' long, with a rise of 8".</p>
<p>7. Installation<br />Hardware and software installation shall be included. But we do not plan to install the system in the WWB because of a power deficiency. We plan, rather, to relocate the system to the NCWCP and install it there, approximately May 2010. If we do install the system in the WWB, we will not require that a second installation be performed by the provider at the NCWCP.</p>
<p>8. Media Removal, Return, and Recovery<br />Requires the ability to remove the backup media, either in part, or total, from the backup system, with the backed up files on it, in order to transport it to remote locations for sake keeping, and then to restore the media to the backup system, and restore it to STAR NAS. Your proposal must describe the backup/restore features of your proposed solution</p>
<p>9. Maintenance<br />Requires at least three years of 8 hours/day (9 am to 5 pm) x 5 days/week (Monday-Friday), next business day, on site, hardware and software maintenance, and phone support. The relocation of the system from the WWB to the NCWCP shall not adversely affect this maintenance contract. Describe fully your proposed maintenance plan and cost.</p>
<p>10. End of Life<br />All components, including hardware and software, of the backup system, must have an end-of-support date past calendar year 2015.</p>
<p>11. Duration of Warranty<br />Offeror must provide the terms, details, covered products, and duration of the warranty for proposed equipment.</p>
<p>Timely proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Contracting Officer shall make a best value award decision based on the following evaluation factors: Proposals will be evaluated against the requirements of the RFP and in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth below to determine the Offeror's demonstrated ability to deliver, install, and maintain a back-up system. General statements such as "the vast resources of our nationwide company will be used to deliver the requirements required by the Statement of Work" are not sufficient. The Offeror shall clearly address each element of the proposal. Any proposal failing to address all of the elements may be considered indicative of the Offeror's lack of understanding in response to the Government's requirements and may be considered unacceptable.</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical Concept- the Technical Solution meets the requirements of the system to utilize commercially available products and services to the maximum extent possible. The technical solution is clear, concise and complete.</p>
<p>Factor II - Maintenance And System Support -The Offeror demonstrates the ability to provide and support the proposed system. A maintenance and system support plan are a required submittal and will be evaluated and ranked.</p>
<p>Factor III - Terms of Offerors Warranty, as well as duration and covered equipment.<br />Factor IV - Past Performance - Past performance will be evaluated based on information provided by the offeror as to actual sales of similar product and back-up system to industry or government agencies (contractor format for past performance data is desired). Past performance will consider the reviews/ratings of other users who presently use or used offerors products, system, and product support services. Offerors must include records of at least three recent sales, within the last 5 years, and identify a point of contact for each by providing a name and telephone number. Failure to submit past performance information (or to address past performance) with your proposal will result in your proposal being made non responsive.</p>
<p>Factor V - Price - The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the proposal. To ensure sufficient information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material necessary for the Government to determine whether the proposed product(s) and support meets technical requirements. Proposals will be reviewed, evaluated, and scored using the following color-rating system: Blue (Exceeds); Green (Acceptable); Yellow (Marginal); Red (Unacceptable). Technical capability combined with past performance is approximately equal to price, but the contracting officer may trade-off price for a higher rated technical solution and make the award to other than the lowest priced offeror. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions. The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial, (no addenda) applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>Offerors shall complete their annual representations and certification at http://orca.bpn.gov and complete para. (b) of 52.212-3, or, if annual ORCA certifications not completed, complete and sign para (c) through (m) of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2009) with its offer. The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (OCT 2008), applies to this acquisition. The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive orders - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

Basis for Award

The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter(s) whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach.  Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter’s quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoters’ technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.


Factor I - Technical Capability 

a. Contract Requirements 

Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter’s ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to lodging, meeting space, audio visual equipment and food and beverage requirements.  Quotations must address the offeror’s ability to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as it relates to lodging and meeting space.  Quotations should reflect quality of services provided and maintained.
		
b. Location 
  
Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility located within the specified postal zip codes with adequate parking for participants and presenters.	 

c. Availability of Dates 
			
Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. The Government will not consider alternate dates.

Factor II - Past Performance 

The quoter must provide references for at least three (3) federal government contracts for similar work performed within the past three (3) years.  The quoter will be evaluated based on customer satisfaction and timeliness.  The contact information for each reference shall include the following: 

Contract type
Contract number
Contract/Task value
Agency/Company Name
Agency/Company point of contact telephone number
Duration of task/contract
Type of services provided (brief description)
List any problems encountered on each contract and the contractor’s corrective actions

EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of timely deliveries and customer service on similar requirements. NOTE: In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase quoters overall rating nor decrease it

Site Visits: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable.  The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities portion of the technical evaluation factors.

Factor III – Price
The price quotation will be evaluated against the independent Government Cost Estimate.

Notice:  The Government reserves the right to make contract award without discussion with   quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, quoters must submit their most favorable terms from a technical standpoint.   In addition to the above, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The contractor shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Item with your quote. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Item and Clause 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Order-Commercial Items are incorporated by reference. Clause 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government - Alternate I, Clause 52.222-3 Convict Labor, Clause 52.222-19 Child Labor – Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, Clause 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, Clause 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, Clause 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, Clause 52.222-50 Combating Trafficking in Persons, Clause 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases, Clause 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer – Central Contractor Registration are incorporated by reference.

The products ability to meet or exceed the SOW specifications.<BR>b. The Offeror identifying all systems in which the GC/MS and MS/MS are compatible with.<BR>c. The Offerors ability to provide engineering support.<BR><BR>	2.  PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION APPROACH.  The Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an Offerors likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that Offerors record of past performance. <BR>   		a. The Government will conduct a past performance assessment based on the Offerors ability to meet the specifications set forth in the SOW.  Areas of relevance will include if the Offeror has past performance of similar contracts to that which is detailed in the RFP.  When assessing past performance, the Government will focus its inquiry on the past performance of the Offeror as it relates to all solicitation requirements.  These requirements include all aspects of schedule, performance and supportability, including the Offerors record of: 1) conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship; 2) adherence to contract schedules; 3) the proven ability of the Offeror to overcome integration and interoperability issues.  <BR>   <BR>   		b. In conducting the past performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the Offerors proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the Offeror, it is incumbent upon the Offeror to explain the relevance of the data provided. While the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk rests with the Offeror.<BR>   <BR>	3.  PRICE EVALUATION APPROACH. In evaluating the Price Factor, the Government will perform a price analysis to determine the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed prices in accordance with FAR 15.404.  <BR><BR>		a. The Government will verify the total proposed contract ceiling price by multiplying the unit price by the maximum quantity in CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0005.  The Government will also multiply the proposed fully loaded hourly rate by the number of hours listed for CLIN 0010.  These three totals will be added together with CLIN 0015 to arrive at a Total Contract Ceiling Price.  <BR><BR>(x) The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Pursuant to the requirements of the test program for commercial items as implemented by Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as implemented by FAR 13.501(a)(ii), this justification for other than full and open competition is supported by the following facts and rationale in the format described at FAR 6.303-2:

(1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a “Justification for other than full and open competition.”

U.S. Coast Guard, Aviation Logistics Center, Long Range Surveillance Division, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, proposes to issue a purchase order on a basis other than full and open competition.

(2)  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.

Approval is requested to purchase, on a sole source basis, a quantity of thirteen (13) separate Line Items of AE2100D3 Engine Support Equipment.  These items are required to support AE2100D3 Programmed Depot Maintenance on the C-130J Aircraft.  

These items are manufactured for Rolls Royce especially for the Rolls Royce AE2100D3 Aircraft Engine. 

The proposed contract type is a firm-fixed price purchase order and the vendor is Rolls Royce Corporation, 2001 South Tibbs Avenue, P.O. Box 420, Indianapolis IN 46206-0420.

(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs (including the estimated value).

As the Aviation Inventory Control Point (AICP), ALC must provide effective supply support for all Coast Guard aviation units and for the Programmed Depot Maintenance Program.  The Programmed Depot Maintenance on the C-130J Aircraft requires removal and re-installation of the AE2100D3 Engines during the PDM process. These 13 items are required to support this removal and re-installation and some minor maintenance associated with inspection and testing of the AE2100D3 engines.  Failure to purchase the required Engine Support Equipment will leave the PDM Line without the capability to remove, store and re-install all four AE2100D3 engines during the whole PDM process, thus adversely impacting  the  U.S. Coast Guard‘s ability to sufficiently overhaul and Repair C-130J Aircraft.  The material and estimated quantities to be procured are based on current mission requirements. 

(4)  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.

 The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled “Only one responsible source or a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements”.

(5) Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition require use of the authority cited. 

The items to be procured are manufactured for Rolls Royce Corporation to support the AE2100D3 Engines and Rolls Royce holds all proprietary rights to the Engines and manufacturing and drawings of all this equipment.  The initial USCG’s purchase for the Aircraft Project Office was solicited on Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Notice HSCG38-06-Q-610014, receiving no other offers. This Equipment is only available from Roll Royce Corporation.  

 (6) Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. - A combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.603 will be issued. This procedure combines the synopsis required by 5.102 (a)(6) and 5.2 and the issuance of the solicitation into a single document.  

(7) Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. – It is the Contracting Officer’s opinion that Firm Fixed price for this procurement will be determined fair and reasonable based on comparison with historical pricing.

(8) Description of the market research.  When conducting market research, the Coast Guard's Aviation Maintenance Management Information System (AMMIS) is checked.  This is a database that provides historical data for all parts purchased by ALC. This database includes, but is not limited to, part number, nomenclature, purchase/delivery order number and historical pricing data. As part of the requirements package, a copy of all AMMIS data is included to support the independent Government estimate. Federal Logistics (FEDLOG) is a federally supported program which lists all manufacturers/suppliers by cage code. This program provides a valuable tool for supplier information and is utilized by requirements personnel to determine if alternate sources of supply exist. Information is accessed by National Stock Number, Nomenclature, item name, supplier name, and cage code. Another source is “Parts Base”. This website is used to locate hard to find parts. - Market surveys are continually conducted to identify new sources of supply for the AE2100D3 Engine, components and spare parts.

(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, i.e., proprietary data packages, etc.
As stated above, Rolls Royce is the OEM for these items and holds all proprietary rights to the manufacturing and drawings for these items. Similar requirements existed in 2006 and the USCG issued a combined synopsis/solicitation for these commercial items. The unrestricted solicitation was posted to FBO for 15 Days, with ample opportunity for any vendors to submit a proposal that met the USCG's requirement. No other vendors responded aside from Rolls Royce Corporation. 

(10) Listing of the sources, if any that expressed in writing, an interest in the acquisition. – 
In accordance with FAR 5.102 and 5.201, the intent to contract for this product will be posted to FEBizOpps.

(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. – 
Although the USCG does not have, nor have access to, the drawings or patterns to this equipment, continued efforts will be made to find new  sources or new developments associated with the AE2100D3 Aircraft Engine tooling, parts and components.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>Questions and answers

1.	Can this study be conducted in our preclinical facility in China?

Response-No, location must be within the United States.

2.	Does this toxicity study require GLP?

Response-No

3.	The solicitation states that monkeys will be lightly sedated with ketamine (10 - 20 mg/kg, im) for the 0 time blood and urine sample collections and oral dosing.  Is this a requirement that will affect comparisons of the data collected with past study data?  If not, would it be acceptable to use a restraint chair for these procedures including gavage as is typically done in NHP facility? 

Response- This is acceptable.

4.	For the 3rd study, we have concerns with sedating and isolating the neonatal males.  Is this a requirement that will affect comparisons of the data collected with past study data?  If not, we recommend that on the day of dosing the dam should be lightly sedated to facilitate hand capture of the neonate.  While the animal is manually restrained a urine sample can be obtained via catheterization, the animal can be bled via the femoral vein, and the dose can be administered via orogastric or nasogastric gavage.  The neonate would need to be recaptured multiple times for the blood collections and returned to the dam immediately after each timepoint.  The dam will likely have to be lightly sedated multiple times during the day (see #3 above).  After the 24 hour blood collection a second urine sample can be obtained via catheterization.  Would these procedures be acceptable in place of those requested in the solicitation?

Response-This is acceptable.

Services may include other Great Lakes languages including Swahili, Kirundi, Runyankore, Rusoga, Rugwere, Ruramogi, and Luganda. ICE requires the translation, transcription, interpretation, and vetting of various documents and interviews in Kinyarwanda and other languages of the African Great Lakes region. Certain documents will require some degree of formatting. Many documents will require certification that they comport with 8 CFR 1003.33. Rwandan documents are frequently written in the native language of all Rwandans, Kinyarwanda. ICE requires that the relevant documents be translated from Kinyarwanda to English with a hard copy in word format. Vendor must possess the ability to provide an accurate word or phrase in another language (English) that is equivalent to that of the original language (Kinyarwanda). Additionally, ICE requires the transcription of witness interviews conducted in Kinyarwanda.

Vendor must possess the ability to carry out oral translation from one language to another. These conversations may range from very brief (minutes in the case of telephone messages and scheduling conversations) to long (several hours in the case of witness interviews). ICE may also require interpretation of conversations between ICE personnel and speakers of other Great Lakes languages including Swahili, Kirundi, Runyankore, Rusoga, Rugwere, Ruramogi, and Luganda. Some of the Kinyarwanda documents need to be examined by a Kinyarwanda translator who is familiar with Rwandan local court records so that the expert can determine which of the many records warrant translation into English. Vendor must possess the ability to conduct a careful examination or scrutiny of the documentation to determine suitability. After vetting of documents, the relevant documents require translation into English. Some of these translations must be certified for use in court. Interested vendors are to provide summary of experience in translating Rwandan to English and past performance information.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to make notice that the Forest Service contemplates releasing a solicitation numbered IFB AG-0116-S-09-0052 on or about April 17, 2009, for the Snipe Creek Instream Restoration project.  If the solicitation is released, it will be released through this FedBizOpps website, and prospective bidders should visit this FedBizOpps website from time to time on or after April 17, 2009, to obtain a copy of the solicitation. This notice meets the requirements of FAR 5.201. However, the Forest Service reserves the right not to release a solicitation. 
 
NOTE REGARDING FEDBIZOPPS LISTINGS. The FedBizOpps website has three separate listings for the Forest Service in Alaska. These are (1) R-10 Alaska Region, Juneau, AK; (2) R-10 Chugach National Forest, Anchorage, AK; and (3) R-10 Tongass National Forest, Ketchikan, AK. Prospective bidders are advised that these three listings are not purely geographic and that a requirement on either the Chugach (Anchorage) or Tongass (Ketchikan) National Forest may be posted under the Regional Office (Juneau) listing. Thus, prospective bidders seeking Forest Service opportunities in Alaska should visit both the appropriate Forest listing (Anchorage or Ketchikan) as well as the Regional listing (Juneau). The solicitation contemplated by this notice will appear under the Ketchikan listing. 
 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION.   The intent of this contract is to provide for the complete project described in the contract. Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, tools, transportation, and supplies and perform all work required to complete the project in accordance with the specifications and provisions of the contract.  

The work is to rehabilitate approximately 2,500 ft of stream corridor and the adjoining floodplain by constructing twenty log structures.  Open up access, repair, reconnect and improve drainage along 1.5 miles of old logging road.  Harvest and stage approximately equal to 55 second-growth conifers with rootwads attached, for helicopter transport.  Work includes clearing, excavation, construction of log structures, staging of materials, construct and place erosion control devices, reopen  approximately 8,000 ft access road, reconstruct 700’ of road for equipment access, pioneering 230’ of access road with puncheon, repair five stream crossings and supply equipment and labor rental to perform the work.  

Road will need to be opened and second-growth trees staged on access prior to helicopter arrival.  All wood required for construction will be staged by helicopter, near or adjacent to each structure under a separate contract.

PROJECT LOCATION. The Snipe Creek Instream Restoration Project site is located on the Craig Ranger District, Prince of Wales Island, in the Cable Creek watershed off of the Hydaburg Highway 913.  The work sites are located in Snipe Creek, and the equipment access point for the project is located along the Hydaburg Highway 913, ~ 1 mile south of the Polk Road (FS Road 21).

<DESC>Synopsis:Amendment 0001
Changes to the Solicitation:
1. Response time and date changes to 3:00 PM Mountain Standard Time, Thursday April 23, 2009. 
2. The guaranteed minimum award is decreased from $40,000 to $25,000.
3. Each task order will not exceed $750,000
Response to interested Parties questions:
1. The Solicitation requires that offerors be licensed in all primary area states. Will the NPS accept firms that have the capabilities to obtain licenses for the rest of the primary area states when projects have been identified and solicited?
Answer: Submittals will be evaluated based on the information contained therein to determine which firm(s) is/are the most highly qualified. Therefore, firms are required to demonstrate in their submittal that they either currently have the required licenses and registrations, or provide a detailed narrative demonstrating how they would obtain registration in each state. The narrative should demonstrate the firm's detailed knowledge of the requirements for each state, as some states have more stringent requirements than others.
2. What islands constitute the Pacific West Islands?
Answer: PACN Pacific Islands NetworkALKA Ala Kahakai NHTAMME American Memorial NPHALE Haleakala NPHAVO Hawaii Volcanoes NPKAHO Kaloko-Honokohau NHPKALA Kalaupapa NHPNPSA National Park of American SamoaPUHE Pu'ukohola Heiau NHSPUHO P'uohonua O Honaunau NHPUSAZ USS Arizona-Pearl Harbor NMWAPA War in the Pacific NHP
3.  What to submit?
Answer: The announcement states the following: "Firms that fully meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a Letter of Interest and a completed SF330 for each firm, a Team Standard Form 330, and an organization chart of the team."
The instructions to the 330 state:
"Part I presents the qualifications for a specific contract" and the firms are to "prepare a separate Part II for each firm that will be part of the team proposed for a specific contract and submitted with Part I"
Each prime completes the 330, and as part of their submittal, they complete part II for each firm that will be part of the team.  

4.  Can a Landscape Architecture firm be the lead firm or prime?
Answer: Yes, there is nothing in the announcement that would prohibit this.  
5. "Sustainable Technologies Specialists" is listed under required disciplines. Can you clarify what this means and if there is a registration or accreditation (such as LEED Accredited Professional) that is desired to satisfy this requirement?
Answer: We are not looking for any type of certification/accreditation, but we are looking for people who demonstrate an in depth knowledge of Sustainable Technologies.
6. For Section F, is there a limit on number of projects that may be submitted?
Answer: Forms should follow the instructions on the SF330, Section F
7. "Additional information should not exceed 20 double-sided pages." One, does "Additional Information" mean the Section H portion of the 330 or something else?  
Answer: The Firm can submit 20 pages in addition to what is in section H of the 330.  The SF-330 can be viewed in Part 53 of the FAR. 
http://acquisition.gov/far/loadmainre.html 8.  Does 20 double-sided pages mean 10 sheets of paper, printed on both sides for 20 printable sides, or does it mean 20 sheets of paper, printed on both sides for 40 printable sides?
Answer: 20 Sheets of paper printed on both sides for 40 printable sides.

<DESC><p>General Information<br />Document Type: Synopsis / Pre-solicitation Notice<br />Solicitation Number: W9126G-09-R-0069 <br />Posted Date: March 13, 2009<br />Synopsis posted for: 15 days<br />Can post solicitation on: March 30, 2009<br />Current Response Date: April 30, 2009<br /><br />Classification Code: Y --- Construction of Structures and Facilities<br />Set Aside: Unrestricted Pool of Contractors <br />NAICS Code: 236220 --- Commercial &amp; Institutional Building Construction <br /><br />Contracting Office Address<br />US Army Engineer District, Fort Worth, ATTN: CESWT-CT (Karen Nelson), 819 Taylor Street Room 2A19, Fort Worth, TX 76102 <br /><br />Description <br />All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing to the following E-Mail address: Karen.S.Nelson@usace.army.mil. This Acquisition shall be competed as UNRESTRICTED. This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only. An unrestricted solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services. Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers: Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area. <br /><br />Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated workload value of $370 million for SWF and SWD customers. <br /><br />Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br /><br />Scope of work includes, but is not limited to, construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities. The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection. <br /><br />The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts as Unrestricted within this pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $100 million and a minimum task order limitation of $100 Thousand. The minimum guarantee for the unrestricted contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <br /><br />In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider 1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement. <br /><br />Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors. However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools. All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government. Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB).<br /><br />There must be more than two awards to create a HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool. If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools, HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <br /><br />For all large businesses proposing under the unrestricted procurement, which requires submission of a subcontracting plan, the Government will require at least 25% of the total dollars that will be awarded to them over the life of the MATOC to be subcontracted. Then, the subcontracting goals set forth in the solicitation and resulting contract will apply to those subcontracted dollars.<br /><br />The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening. All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government. <br /><br />The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates. These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates. After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing. However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule. The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs. The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for: All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million. <br /><br />This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov. Notification of amendments shall be made via FebBizOpps only. It is the contractors responsibility to check the below-listed Internet address daily for any posted changes to this solicitation. No corrections and/or changes to proposals will be allowed after the proposal submittal due time and date. <br /><br />Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about the estimated date of March 30, 2009.

<DESC><p>1. The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC)/Army Strategic Command (ARSTRAT) intends to solicit and award a competitive 8(a) award to a single source through a hybrid firm-fixed price (FFP) type contract with Time-and-Materials and Cost Reimbursement CLINs for Fort Greely Alaska (FGA) Base Operations Support (BOS). The Cost Reimbursement CLIN will be available for other supplies, training and travel requirements. The RFP will be requesting the offerors bid known supplies, training and travel as part of their proposed costs, so this CLIN will only be used on a limited basis. This procurement is a follow-on to the current sole source 8(a) award CPFF IDIQ contract for the FGA BOS which expires on September 30, 2009. The contract will support Fort Greely Alaska Garrison and agencies which collaborate with them on base support and missions in support of the warfighter. USASMDC/ARSTRAT anticipates that one contract will be competitively awarded as a result of this 100% 8(a) set-aside. The resultant contract will have the capacity to provide base operation support to FGA and their tenants and shall support the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements, which include, but are not limited to: MDA Lodging and Housekeeping, Fire Alarm Maintenance, Custodial, Indoor and Outdoor Pest Control, Access Control Services for MDC, Environmental, Engineering, Refuse Removal Transport and Disposal, MDA Facilities Maintenance, and Visitors Center. Offerors will not bid on the draft PWS at this time. PWS Chapters 15 30 services are slated to be in-sourced with Department of Army Civilians. If transition plan is delayed, the Contractor may be requested to provide these services to be determined. The Contractor will not provide costs for these transition services in the final solicitation. These chapters are merely for scope purposes, should the services be necessary. The transition services are: Automation and Network Support, Human Resources Support, Food Services, Logistic Support, Centralized Dispatch, Resource Management Administrative and Analyst, Single Soldier Housing (SSH) Support, Safety Operations Support, Snow Removal, Grounds Maintenance, Allen Army Airfield Operations and Services, Facilities Support/Service Order Repair (Garrison), Religious Support, Garrison Protocol Support, Strategic Planning Support, and Directorate of Public Works Business Operations. When posted, the draft PWS, draft solicitation, applicable attachments and exhibits, and other historical FGA BOS documents and related information will be posted to Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI). An initial round of one-on-one meetings were held with industry on February 3 and 4, 2009. These one-on-one meetings were held as a market research mechanism to help determine best commercial practices, to maximize competition, and achievement of cost efficiencies in the acquisition process. Questions and answers related to the one-on-one sessions and the draft PWS were not posted or released; however, recommendations that the Government considered relevant were incorporated into the solicitation. A draft solicitation and associated supporting documents will be posted to FedBizOps in a follow-on notice.

PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION, AS ONE DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXIST.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO ACCESS THE MARKET’S CAPABILITY AND TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIAL VENDORS.

1.)  USTRANSCOM Contracting Office intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  At this time, the Government knows only one source that is capable of meeting the Governments requirements, as follows:

a.)  USTRANSCOM J3/CIP and SDDC/TEA-SA have a requirement to develop an enterprise Geographic Information System (GIS) framework on the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) that would support the production and dissemination of relevant TCJ3-FC Critical Infrastructure Program (CIP) data to USTRANSCOM and Defense CIP (DCIP) stakeholders.  The Enterprise GIS framework must provide CIP users with a geospatial data storage and production environment with the ability to publish CIP geospatial data and analysis results for dissemination to other USTRANSCOM personnel and DCIP partners.  The system shall allow CIP users to store and produce GIS data and geospatial analysis products using geospatial analysis software (e.g. ArcGIS Desktop).

b.)  CIP users must have the capability to publish a Web Map Service (WMS) and Web Feature Service (WFS) that provides USTRANSCOM CIP data to TCJ3-FC approved users and systems within USTRANSCOM and the DCIP community.  Customers requiring CIP data may include, but not be limited to, the Strategic Mission Assurance Data System (SMADS), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s (NGA) Palanterra, and the Mission Assurance Division’s Homeland Defense Mission Assurance Portal (HD-MAP). The system shall allow users to publish a WMS and WFS that provides the NGA’s base-map data and imagery for areas of interest worldwide for use by ArcGIS Desktop users.  The base-map/imagery WMS/WFS shall support geospatial analysis capabilities and map production throughout the Command.  These web services shall allow users to access to the Vector Map (VMAP) and Urban VMAP (UVMAP) data, imagery from the Commercial Satellite Imagery Library (CSIL), and the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) 133 Cities Imagery, in addition to other NGA-acquired commercial data sources worldwide (e.g. NAVTEQ streets, points of interest, and land use).

In addition, users of the system, at a minimum, require the following system capabilities:

c.)  Incorporate elevation data such as Digital Elevation Models (DEM), Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED), and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) products.

d.)  Publish a metadata catalog that allows personnel to search USTRANSCOM GIS data holdings, to include CIP data.  The metadata catalog should also provide a data download capability (in multiple formats – i.e. text, Excel, shapefile, Personal Geodatabase).  

e.)  Incorporate hazard model data such as the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability (HPAC), the Consequences Assessment Tool Set (CATS), and the Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset (IWMDT).  

f.)  Incorporate weather data from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Center to include weather radar data, meteorological satellite imagery, weather forecast model data, and hurricane/tropical storm tracks and wind fields.

g.)  Incorporate natural hazard information to include earthquake, hurricane, flood, volcano, and wildfires.  This should include, but not be limited to, natural hazard risk data from the Department of Transportation (DOT)-sponsored Natural Disaster Study by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  

h.)  Allow navigation controls that allow for zooming and panning of world-wide map displays.

i.)  Layer display controls that allow users to select and de-select the visible layers in the map display.

j.)  Search and filter the data layers by attributes on all the available data fields.

k.)  Search and filter the data layers by geographic location, user-defined extents, and proximity to features from other data layers.

l.)  Select map features to identify and view the associated attribute information.

m.)  Enable tooltips so information can be displayed for select map features when moused-over.

n.)  Enable hyperlinks to additional information (such as CIP reports, intelligence reports, and threat assessments) when clicked on in the map display.

o.)  Define buffer areas and geo-fence based on a data layer and/or feature.  For example, a user should be able to select oil pipeline features of interest and define a buffer area and/or geo-fence around those features.

p.)  Perform distance and area measurements from within the map interface.

q.)  Generate multi-modal routes based on user-defined start and end point locations.

r.)  Determine multi-modal re-routes based on user-defined avoidance and hazard areas.

Contractors should have expertise in secured lending facilities, including facilities involving international collateral.  

Area 4.  DIP Financing Transactions.  The Contractor may be tasked to structure, negotiate and close large, complex DIP loans to auto industry participants.  

Area 5.  Asset-Backed Financing.  The Contractor may be tasked to provide expertise and guidance in the formulation of financing facilities involving the purchase and sale of, or addition of credit enhancement to, asset-backed securities. The Contractor also may be tasked to negotiate the transactions with auto industry participants, and conduct the closing of such transactions.  

Area 6.  Other Transactions.  The Contractor may be tasked to provide expertise and guidance in the formulation of loans, equity investments, other direct investments and other credit support relating to the auto industry participants.  The Contractor would provide expertise and guidance in developing the form, structure, terms and conditions of such documentation.
