The standards will address any special concerns (e.g., the use of vulnerable populations or heightened risk to privacy and confidentiality) that may arise in each setting. 
The standards will identify outcome measures that the CAVHS can use to assess and demonstrate quality improvement over time.
These standards will be performance-based using objective criteria and measurable outcomes to evaluate whether a Human Research Protection Program effectively implements the standards. The evaluation will result in a grade of pass or fail for each standard and, where appropriate, will also include commendations or recommendations for meeting the standards. 
The accreditation process will provide a clear, understandable pathway to accreditation, along with equally clear pathways for appeal and the remediation of identified shortcomings. 
The accreditation process will be educational involving collegial discussion and constructive feedback. The accreditation process will also identify areas in which the Human Research Protection Program does not yet meet the standards and to give CAVHS the opportunity to discuss potential program improvements. 
The accreditation process will be responsive to changes, in federal regulations and to standards that will evolve, based on what AAHRPP learns from accrediting Organizations from research settings. 
AAHRPP will review all relevant, necessary and de-identified documentation as needed for accrediting the CAVHS.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p><em>The 12-ton jack tripod spacer satisfies the fleet's need by reducing the gap between the deck surface and the bottom jack feet on fielded 12-ton jacks with stiff caster springs that do not fully compress under the weight of the air vehicle. When in use, the spacer would be prepositioned under the air vehicle jacking point and the tripod jack will be lifted and positioned so that the three caster wheels are constrained within their respective slots. The 12-ton Jack Spacers is an integral piece of Support Equipment needed for MQ-8 B/C Squadrons.</em></p>
<p><em>The 12-ton Jack Spacers, P/N 4135AS0195-1, shall be manufactured in accordance with Government-owned technical data / drawings which contain technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act.

An incomplete and / or late proposal will not be considered for evaluation and / or award. The Government reserves the right to cancel this Solicitation, either before or after the response date.

<p><em>Proposed pricing, both individual and total, must be complete and final.</em></p>
<p><em>Vendors are put on notice that the Government will not be held liable for any requirement that is to be paid for by participants or any amounts associated with those items, including any guaranteed minimum purchases that the Vendor may require. A written notice of award or acceptance of a proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Vendor within the time for acceptance specified in the proposal, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<p><em>SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT (SAM) REQUIREMENT: This Solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to be considered for award, pursuant to applicable regulations and guidelines.

Interested Vendors are cautioned that their initial proposal should contain the Vendors best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to obtain clarifications and/or conduct discussions and request quote revisions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. A Vendors past performance will be evaluated in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 9 - "Contractor Qualifications" and will be included in the Government's responsibility determination. All proposals will be evaluated for compliance with the terms, conditions, and requirements set forth in this Solicitation.</em></p>
