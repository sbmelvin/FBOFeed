<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) project (https://cto.acqcenter.com/osd/portal.nsf/) to evaluate operational prototypes for Rapid 3D Terrain Data for Precision Navigation in GPS Denied Areas.  If approved as a FCT project, USSOCOM intends to award one or more contracts  as set forth in DFARS 206.302-1(b) to test and evaluate use of foreign technologies to provide a clear military advantage to SOF forces during maneuver and engagement operations.
<p>Key characteristics of the final integrated solution include:</p>
<p>1.	Technology can be shown to significantly speed production of globally correlated data in open standard formats currently utilized by SOF Planning, Rehearsal and Execution Preparation (SOFPREP) data generation facility. Test objective is a 3 to 10 times faster computational process.</p>
<p>2.	Technology can be shown to be capable of at least two high resolution 3D output formats, Common Database (CDB) and Virtual Battlespace (VBS), compatible with the broadest range of SOF mission planning and rehearsal systems.</p>
<p>3.	Technology can be shown to produce data meeting geospatial accuracy and resolution standards in USSOCOM Directive 71-3.</p>
<p>4.	Vendor will demonstrate GEOINT interoperability through appropriate SISO and OGC compliant specifications, interfaces and open standards over proprietary ones with tests to ensure alternative implementations can be used.</p>

Upon award of a contract, the contractor will be issued an Entry Authorization List (EAL) by the contract administrator in 341 CONS.

Upon initial entrance to Malmstrom AFB, contractors' personnel shall obtain a contractor's pass from the Visitor's Center where the EAL will be filed. Contractor passes will be valid for the duration of the contract. The contractor will be required to resubmit a new EAL upon exercising option years, contract renewals or extensions, and adding or subtracting names to and from the EAL.<br />d. If contractors need access to Malmstrom AFB for time(s) outside of the performance period of the contract (i.e., administrative issues, warranty issues, site visits), they will need to be vouched on by the customer, or supporting agency, of the respective contract they are associated with.<br />e. at the time contractors initially come to the Visitor's Center to obtain their pass, they will be required to fill out DD Form 1172, which the Visitor's Center will issue and maintain.<br />f. It will be the sole responsibility of the contractor to renew, remove, and add employees to the EAL. In order to renew, remove or add names to the EAL the contractor must follow the same processes as if they were submitting the EAL for the first time. <br />g. For existing contracts that are already in progress, contractors will follow the procedures mentioned above if any person(s) need a new or updated pass.<br />h. Any other instances where contractors need access to Malmstrom AFB will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis in which the customer, or supporting agency, will need to sponsor contractor personnel entry and accompany them while on base.<br />i. All passes must be returned to 341 SFS (Visitor Center) upon completion of the contract, or personal no longer require access to the installation, under performance of this contract.<br />j. Vehicles owned by your firm will be permitted entry to Malmstrom AFB if they are conspicuously marked with your firm's name or logo, with the exception of magnetic signs, when you have contract requiring performance on the base. If your vehicles are not so marked, it will be necessary for you to obtain a temporary vehicle registration for each vehicle to be operated on Malmstrom AFB. This registration is accomplished by the contractor or designated representative at the Pass and Registration Section. Proof of ownership and a current valid driver's license are required for vehicle registration.

<DESC>This is a solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR PART 13.106 for the requirement under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation number is FDA-15-223-SOL-1150449 and this solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).<br />The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-82 dated June 08, 2015.
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712- Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. This RFQ is issued as a set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>Contract Type: Commercial Item - Firm Fixed Price</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Part I: General Information (Introduction/Background/Scope)</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Winchester Engineering Analytical Center (WEAC) Laboratory is engaged in an on-going project to develop a real-time environmental sampling platform to produce contaminate-free sample assays. The process utilizes oxidative Chemical Vapor Deposition (oCVD) to protect assays from pathogen contamination and has generated a high surface area biosensor that utilizes changes in resistance or conductivity measurement to confirm pathogen presence. The high surface area is generated by melt spinning polypropylene into mats that can be cut into any size or shape needed. The high porosity increases the probability that the functionalized environmental sponge will come into contact with and trap any microorganism present in a sample. The spun polypropylene is coated with a nano layer of polymer Poly 3, 4- Ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT).</p>
<p>Scope: <br />The contractor shall supply engineering and support services for the application of oxidative Chemical Vapor Deposition of Poly 3, 4- Ethylenedioxythiophene for FDA supplied samples.</p>
<p>Samples will be shipped by the government on a monthly basis, and will not exceed 3 samples per month, and 30 samples per contract period of performance. Samples will most commonly consist of denier of melt spun polypropylene, but ongoing experimentation may require substitution with other denier(s) or materials, including but not limited to electro-spun polypropylene, nylon, glass or other solid substrate. Sample sizes will be 1cm x 2 cm or one 8in x 11in sheet of the 4 g denier melt spun polypropylene, shipped to the contractor at the Government's expense.</p>
<p>Part II: Work Requirements<br />At a minimum the contractor shall:<br />&bull;Provide oCVD deposited coating of samples with complete thickness uniformity that shall not exceed 18 um<br />&bull;Provide uniform coating in process parameter with the uniformity requirement provided by the TPOC for each sample<br />&bull;Provide thickness verification by laser microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) or other Electron Microscopy (EM) methodology<br />&bull;Work with the Government's Technical Point of Contract (TPOC) in relation to specific control variations in an effort to control or eliminate thickness variability<br />&bull;Conduct empirical experimentation with thickness adjustments to as low as 100nm upon request of TPOC<br />&bull;Return samples at contractor's expense to the TPOC within one-week of sample receipt<br />&bull;Accommodate a minimum of one double sided deposition per week consisting of:<br />oTwo deposition runs with one side of the material coated, subjected to dopant exchange, then the material is inverted, coated and subjected to dopant exchange<br />oAcid rinse dopant exchange of 15 minute immersion in 1M sulfuric acid followed by 30 minutes drying and 5 minute methanol rinse <br />&bull;Accommodate process design modifications as directed by the TPOC regarding the base material or coating monomer ratio relative to coating uniformity<br />oAdjust monomer ratio based on TPOC observations of preceding samples<br />oRefinement of monomer ratio shall require mass flow metering of any/all monomers</p>
<p>Schedule of Items <br />Please see attached PDF file identified as FDA-15-223-SOL-1150449 with Schedule of Items</p>
<p><br />Part III: Supporting Information<br />Samples shall be delivered to:</p>
