<SUBJECT>56 -- Two-phase design build project to mitigate potential damages to waste management facilities and operations that have occurred, or may occur, in the event of a fire or fire-related natural disaster.

<DESC>Point of Contact James L. Palmer, Sr. Contract Administrator, 505 665-0743

Firms interested in participating in the two-phased selection process for this design/build project should submit an expression of interest to the point of contact (POC) shown above. 
A.  The objective of the CGR WMRM Project is to mitigate potential damages to waste management facilities and operations that have occurred, or may occur, in the event of a fire or fire-related natural disaster.  Demonstrated vulnerabilities arose during the Cerro Grande fire in May 2000 that presented unacceptable risk to LANL's waste operations grade, and will require significant site excavation.  Geotechnical studies performed to date indicate the site soils will be considered as low-level radioactive waste.  Disposal of this waste is planned for disposal at LANL's Technical Area 54.

      B.	This project provides for additions and modifications to existing equipment, facilities that will mitigate these risks. The new facility and associated equipment will allow RLW to be safely collected and monitored in the event of a fire or other natural disaster.  This subproject adds over 300,000-gallons RLW tank storage, remote influent RLW monitoring/controls, pumps and mixers to supplement existing equipment at TA-50-01.  The equipment will be housed in a new facility, approximately 10,000-ft. in plan area, located at TA-50.  The new facility will be categorized as a Hazard Category 3, Nuclear Facility.  Given that the new facility must collect RLW from incoming gravity drain lines, it will be situated approximately 25-ft. below grade, and will require significant site excavation.  Geotechnical studies performed to date indicate the site soils will be considered as low-level radioactive waste.  Disposal of this waste is planned for disposal at LANL's Technical Area 54.

C.  This pre-solicitation notice is provided to assist Design-Build (DB) firms with planning for an upcoming Request for Qualification (RFQ) and subsequent Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Los Alamos National Laboratory (hereafter Laboratory), Cerro Grande Fire Rehabilitation Team, wishes to contract with a DB firm to provide definitive design and construction services for the subject project.
 
The successful execution of the work will require a DB firm to organize a specialized team with demonstrated definitive design and construction experience as outlined in the forthcoming Request for Qualification (RFQ).  The RFQ will specify the criteria that firms must satisfy to qualify for responding to the subsequent project Request for Proposal (RFP). An RFP is slated for release in July 2002 with contract award planned for November 2002.

I.   This solicitation will use a best-value source selection conducted in two phases. In Phase One, prospective offerors will submit their qualification information. This information will be evaluated by the University to select the prospective offeror(s) that qualify to submit proposals in response to the RFP under Phase Two.  

II.   In Phase One, the RFQ will be posted on or about June 3, 2002 at LANL website   http://bus.lanl.gov/bus5/vendor/solicitations/default.htm with a response due on or about June 19, 2002. The RFQ will include detailed pre-qualification evaluation factors and submittal instructions. Qualification factors may include but not be limited to: (1) demonstrated successful completion of design-build projects similar to this scope of work, with a contract value of at least $20,000,000; (2) experience working with other member(s) of the proposed team on previous design-build construction projects; (3) an acceptable safety record, determined by evaluating the offeror's safety record for three annual periods by using the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Guidelines to determine documented record and lost workdays from the offeror's OSHA 200 logs; and (4) a documented quality assurance program.  Any subsequent revisions to the RFQ will be shown on the referenced Internet website. Although the University will not mail, fax, or e-mail the RFQ pages or any update(s) to the RFQ, the University will send e-mail notifications of updates to interested firms who register with the University for such updates, as instructed on the website. The website is occasionally inaccessible due to maintenance. The University is not responsible for any loss of Internet connectivity or for an offeror(s) inability to access the document posted at the referenced website.   

III.   In Phase Two, the University will accept proposals, submitted in response to the  RFP, only from the offeror(s) selected in Phase One.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to procure historical, global atmospheric data for a project titled: "CLOUDS AND EARTH'S RADIANT ENERGY SYSTEM (CERES)." The data will be purchased as one, 13-month lot with an Option to purchase a 12-month lot. Data required: 4-dimensional assimilation data for atmospheric temperature vertical profile, atmospheric water vapor profile, surface properties including skin temperature, surface pressure, 10 meter level surface wind speed components, 2 meter level temperature and dewpoint. Spatial resolution of the data is to be at least 0.56 degrees in latitude and longitude for spatially gridded data fields and at least T213 for spherical harmonic data fields.  Time sampling is to be 6 hourly for uninitialized analysis data and 3 hourly for first-guess data.   This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) using FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  NASA LaRC intends to purchase the data from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) who is the only responsible source and no other services will satisfy the agency requirements.  ECMWF's data provides temperature, wind speed and humidity at all levels of the atmosphere on a global basis. It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to become qualified to generate global weather data and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 3, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:    http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to procure a Fokker 28 NASA Structural Analysis (NASTRAN)static finite element computer model and support for in-house development of a dynamic finite element model to be used in an Aviation Safety Program test and analysis project. This procurement will include two (2) six month option periods for additional engineering support. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)under FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Stork - Fokker Services B.V., which is the only responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy the agency requirements.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to become qualified to develop a computer model for the Fokker 28 which contains proprietary data and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 03, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:       http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Advanced Technology Office, and Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) Sensors Directorate will be hosting an Industry Day for the Synthetic Aperture Lidar for Tactical Imaging (SALTI) program. An industry day classified briefing of the SALTI program for interested representatives of Government and industry will be held on Tuesday, 4 June 2002. The briefing will be held from 9 AM to 1 PM at The Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Laboratory, Warfare Analysis Laboratory (Bldg 26), 11100 Johns Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD. 20723-6099.  A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicitation will be released shortly after the Industry Day. Information contained in the BAA announcement takes precedence over any information obtained from the Industry Day or any other sources.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Advanced Technology Office (ATO) and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is intending to further pursue enabling detector and laser Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technologies via the Synthetic Aperture Lidar for Tactical Imaging (SALTI)  Program.  This industry day is intended to provide potential sources with advanced information that may be useful in preparing proposals when the BAA solicitation is issued for this program. The objective of the DARPA/AFRL SALTI program is to conduct a proof-of-concept airborne demonstration of a sensor and associated ground data processing which generates high-resolution 2D and 3D imagery combining the interpretability of electro-optics, the long-range day/night access of high-altitude X-band synthetic aperture radar, and the exploitability of 3-dimensional lidar. The proposed sensor system is anticipated to have a multi-channel multicolor coherent laser transceiver capable of day/night operation and operation in partially degraded weather, which would collect coherent optical phase history data and range-Doppler data. This data would be processed into synthetic aperture optical imagery. The proposed sensor system also would have an alternate operating mode, in which it generates optical range-Doppler imagery and accomplishes ground moving target identification (GMTI) by active optical means with excellent geolocation accuracy. The primary technical accomplishments necessary for a successful end product include, but are not limited to: 1) Developing coherent laser sources with the appropriate power and waveform to collect high resolution imagery at long slant range, 2) Developing broadband heterodyne optical receivers capable of collecting high resolution imagery over a wide-field-of-view, 3) Developing optical synthetic aperture image formation signal processing capabilities, including motion compensation techniques, 4) Exploiting broad laser bandwidth and diverse waveforms to recover accurate 3D imagery from interferometric synthetic optical aperture data with tactically significant unambiguous height measurement, and 5) Developing and executing an integrated airborne demonstration to produce high quality 2-D and 3-D imagery and GMTI from data collected at long range on a high-altitude airborne platform. A significant system engineering challenge exists to implement this capability. It is anticipated that SALTI will require significant innovation in sensor system architectures and concepts of operation, laser and coherent receiver architectures and subsystems, and signal processing algorithms.  It is anticipated that the DARPA/AFRL procurement of the SALTI system will occur in two phases over a 51-month period. In Phase 1, system trade studies, subsystem technology development, laboratory and field experiments and data analysis will be used to (a) refine the SALTI system concept, (b) develop the preliminary design for the integrated airborne demonstration in Phase 2, and (c) demonstrate readiness of the underlying technology for the integrated demonstration. In Phase 2, an end-to-end synthetic aperture lidar demonstration systemwill be critically designed, built, integrated, flight qualified and tested, operated and demonstrated on a high-altitude airborne platform. The Phase 2 demonstration system will integrate significant pieces of hardware and software developed and tested in Phase 1, as well as additional critical subsystems manufactured in Phase 2. Due to the diverse nature of the technologies and activities involved in SALTI, the government strongly encourages the use of contractor teams to integrate best-in-class capabilities into an end-to-end SALTI system solution. Organizations wishing to send representatives should register via the SALTI Industry Day Registration web site (preferred) http://schafercorp-ballston.com/salti, via e-mail, by fax or in writing.

Expendaable weather balloon instrument package 403 MHZ Los (Differential) GPS Mark II Micronsonde, Model No. GPS Mark II . This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Sippican, Inc. Meteorological Systems Group, 7 Barnabas Road, Marion, MA 02738-1499. The authority of other than full and open competition is 10 U.SC. 2304 (c)(1).

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 6, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Ms. Gloria Butler, Hagerstown, Maryland, to provide expert technical training room support services to the NIH Business and Research Support System (NBRSS) Office.

This analysis has determined that the NIH must replace its current system with an off-the-shelf software products.  These products have been selected and a system integrator has been hired to implement this software at NIH.  NIH is seeking the assistance from an individual with an expert understanding of NIH technical and administrative systems, particularly with the Administrative Data Base (ADB).  NIH requires the expert technical consulting services to support the NBRSS project for a period of three years.  Specifically, the contractor shall assist the NBRSS Change Management Team, Functional Team Members and the Technical Team in the following areas:  1) supervise and maintain computer classrooms, i.e., setup of computers and peripherals in the training room, maintain and upgrade computer hardware and software, etc.;  2) serve as technical liaison for remote training locations;  3)  serve as training room coordinator, i.e., schedule classes and room usage, assist instructors/ students during training, assist in the preparation, printing, and disbursement of training materials, etc.; 4) develop and maintain databases that will store/compile communication and training survey data;  5) develop online surveys to be posted on the NBRSS website and  assist in the preparing and conducting surveys, i.e., post training materials/job aids on the web, post regular updates to the website, modify the website to meet NBRSS needs, etc.;  6) participate in the testing, documentation and deployment of the NBRSS systems, i.e., assist in testing the NBRSS system, assist with deployment activities.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to procure on a sole source basis with Christine Bucher, Fort Washington, MD to maintain and advance state-of-the-art tunable Ti:Sapphire-pumped THz lasers and apply these sources to the spectroscopy of biomolecules in cryogenic matrices, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) Only One Source Reasonably Available.  Specific tasks include:  1) maintaining the operation of a cw Ti:Sapphire-pumped THz and Far-Infrared Fourier Transform spectrometers; 2) modifying THz spectrometers to accept a 4 K to 300 K cryostat for the measurement of  high-resolution spectra of cryogenic samples in rare gas, H2 matrices and/or critical fluid cells; 3) demonstrating performance of the cryostat system by recording spectra of biomolecules taken in low temperature polyethylene, rare gas/H2 matrices and/or critical fluid cells; 4) undertaking standard spectroscopic analysis of recorded spectra and work with theorists and/or available software to obtain solid-state vibrational spectra of studied systems; 5) using cw and/or pulsed THz spectrometers to obtain spectra of peptides or short DNA's; 6) aiding in the development of time-domain THz spectrometer and imaging system; 7) extending studies to larger biomolecular systems, such as myoglobin and biochemical agents; and, 8) performing systematic investigations to resolve finger print features vs. instrument artifacts.  This is a sole source procurement because the Contractor has extensive expertise in laser spectroscopy, cryogenic sampling and vibrational spectroscopy biomolecules.  Her post-doctoral work is in the area of laser spectroscopy and dynamics using ultrafast lasers and her Ph.D. work involved research in high sensitivity spectroscopic techniques using cryogenically-cooled systems.  This unique training is essential to enable program milestones to be accomplished on time.

The lowest price proposal will not necessarily receive the award; likewise, the highest technically rated proposal will not receive the award.  Rather, the Government will award to that Offeror whose proposal offers the best overall value to the Government.

Evaluation Process:
The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with AFFARS 5315.305 and the criteria listed.  There will be six parts to the evaluation.  These are (1) Initial check for compliance (2) Technical mission capability evaluation (3) Proposal Risk Assessment (4) Past Performance Assessment (5) Price and (6) Responsibility Evaluation.
The Solicitation should be available on or about 8 Mar 2002.  The Solicitation will be available on CD only.  No hard copy documents will be issued.  Estimated closing date for proposals is on or about 16 April 2002.  Telephone requests for this proposal will not be honored.  FAX or E-mail request will be accepted. The FAX number is (210) 671-1196.  The E-mail address is Viola.Muniz@Randolph.af.mil.  Requests should cite the RFP No. F41689-02-R-0045.  Bid guarantee is required.  Liquidated damages (LD) will apply to this project.  LD calendar daily rate is
$ 1189.06/day.  The request for solicitation package must include a 9-digit zip code.  Also, please include e-mail address for your POC if possible.

<CONTACT>Robert Mohn, Contracting Officer, 412-386-4963, mohn@netl.doe.gov;Robert Mohn, Contract Specialist, 412-386-4963, mohn@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>SUBJECT: SUPPORT FOR OBTAINING A RESEARCH PERMIT TO CONDUCT THE INTERNATIONAL CO2 OCEAN SEQUESTRATION FIELD EXPERIMENT AT NAWILIWILI, KAUAI. DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a  purchase order on a sole-source basis to the Pacific International Center for High Technology Research, Honolulu, HI to complete the following statement of work. STATEMENT OF WORK: The Pacific International Center for High Technology Research (PICHTR) is the implementing organization previously selected by an International consortium, of which the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is a member, to perform c CO2 Ocean Sequestration Field Experiment.  PICHTR and its selected subcontractor shall provide support for obtaining a research permit, under the Ocean Dumping Act, to conduct the Field Experiment at Nawiliwili, Kauai. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region IX in San Francisco, CA, is the regulatory agency with authority to issue the required permit. Initial application to EPA for a research permit was submitted by PICHTR in May 2001, and EPA accepted the permit application in late 2001.  EPA published a Public Notice on March 14, 2002, soliciting comments on the proposed project and requested that comments be provided by a closing date for the comment period was extended to May 14, and EPA anticipates holding multiple public hearings, possible on Kauai and Oahu, before the end of the extended comment period. Before EPA issues a research permit, all comments received form the public must be addressed, PICHTR shall provide support for addressing those comments. In addition, PICHTR shall prepare information needed by EPA to support conduct of the public hearings and shall participate in those hearings.  Since the EPA process for issuing research permits incorporates additional opportunities for public review and hearings subsequent to close of the comment period, extending over a nominal time period of six months, PICHTR shall provide the additional support needed to facilitate completion of the permitting process within a six-month time period, ending on September 30.  PICHTR shall provide assistance for responding to public comments, for holding public hearings, and for interacting with agencies involved in the permitting process. This request is considered to be sole source to the Pacific International Center for High Technology Research, Honolulu, HI because their personnel are uniquely qualified to perform the required tasks and the following reasons: The proposed location for the research project is an EPA-designated ocean dredged material disposal site.  PICHTR, a non-profit research and development organization, represents the International Consortium which has been formed to pursue this effort.  The members of the consortium are entities from Australia, Japan, Norway, Canada, Switzerland, and the U.S.   PICHTR is also responsible for building the infrastructure for the experiment.  It is important to the DOE Carbon Sequestration Program that such an ocean dumping permit be obtained since a number of other carbon sequestration projects will also require environmental permits and a familiarity and experience with these EPA permitting procedures is important in view of the fact that the test would take place in U.S. Territorial Waters.  This request is considered to be a sole source award to the Pacific International Center for High Technology Research, Honolulu, HI.  Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. This award shall be made using simplified acquisition procedures.  Requests for solicitation will be considered non-responsive.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS. Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770 and e-mail mohn@netl.doe.gov.

<CONTACT>Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@tda.gov
<DESC>Submission Proposal Place:  Mr. Guo Baojian, Director, World Bank APL Shanghai Urban Environmental Plan, Municipal Solid Waste Component Office, 369 Yongjia Road, Shanghai 200031, CHINA, Tel: (86-21) 6437-2937, Fax: (86-21) 6471-2802 :  

The Grantee invites submission of Prequalification Statements from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to the Shanghai Municipal Government for design, review, and advisory assistance for the Shanghai Urban Environmental Plan Phase 2 which will be funded by the World Bank under an adaptable program loan (APL).  Based upon the Prequalification Statements, the Grantee will develop a short list of qualified firms which will be invited in writing to submit a formal Technical Proposal to carry out the study.

Shanghai Municipality is located at the east front edge of the Yangtze River Delta, and faces the Hangzhou Gulf in the south and the Yangtze River in the north.  The Municipality borders on the East Sea in the east and connects with Jiangsu, Zhejiang the provinces in the west.  The area (including mudflats along the seashore) of the whole city's city domain is 7823.44km2.  The central part of Shanghai Municipality comprises Huangpu, Jingan, Changning, Putuo, Zhabei, Hongkou, Yangpu, Puwan, Xuhui, Baoshan, Minhang and Jiading Districts.  In all there are 18 administrative districts and one county.  The permanent inhabitant population is 14.64 million persons, which together with a floating population of approximately 3.50 million persons, gives a total population of 18.10 million persons.  Shanghai is a major economic and commercial centre within China and has a reputation for being at the forefront of China?s program of economic reforms.  The large population and rapid development is understandably placing extreme pressure on urban infrastructure and the natural and urban environment.  Shanghai recognises that sustainable development, provision of modern urban infrastructure and environmental protection are inextricably linked. 

Following on from successful previous projects in the water, wastewater and environmental sectors the Grantee has now negotiated a new ambitious development project to be financed with assistance from the World Bank.  This project is the Shanghai Urban Environmental Project (SHUEP) and the World Bank financing structure is an APL.  This APL is made up of three phases, the first phase having been approved in mid-2001.  This is the first loan of this type in China and is closely linked to the setting and achieving of broad development goals ? not just construction of urban infrastructure.  Achievement of these broad development goals necessitates a large program of technical assistance and related support to the Grantee, which itself is part of the APL.  

The Technical Assistance will assist Shanghai in the implementation of the institutional and financial reform program as initiated by the Grantee and in accordance with the People?s Republic of China market reforms and opening up policy, in preparation of the project for application for the second tranche of loan money in the APL 2.  The World Bank requires that the loan application be supported by review and analyses of the proposed components to an exacting standard, which will meet the World Bank requirements.  Specific tasks include: design, review, and advisory services for facilities design and procurement implementation; investigation of solid waste management charging; and the investigation of market-based instruments.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $858,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes the requirements for submission of the Prequalification Statements and the Technical Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Prequalification Statements as outlined in the RFP in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M. local time, June 24, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Prequalification Statements and the Technical Proposals are included in the RFP.  Price will NOT be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Prequalification Statements or Technical Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>SUBJECT: TILT TABLE RELOCATION DISMANTLE @ MARATHON OIL IN LITTLETON AND RE-ASSEMBLE AT UNIVERSITY OF TULSA. DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a  purchase order on a sole-source basis to the University of Tulsa, Tulsa, OK  to complete the following statement of work. STATEMENT OF WORK: Dismantle, relocate, and re-assemble the Hydrates Flow Loop Tilt Table from Littleton, CO to the University of Tulsa, Tulsa, OK to include the following: 1.  All wiring that is in cable tray between tilt table and control room will be disconnected from tilt table, rolled up and shipped with control room. 2.  All components in mechanical buildings will be removed in the largest pieces practical and shipped.  The rest of the mechanical building will be piece marked and disassembled for re-erection and shipped.. 3.  All miscellaneous pipe, equipment, light poles, etc. will be disassembled, secured on flatbed trailer, and shipped to Tulsa, Oklahoma. 4.  The tilt table will be moved in one piece, lifted with spreader beams from its foundation, placed on a stretch trailer and transported to Tulsa, OK. 5.  All components of the tilt bed will be received at the University of Tulsa and re-assembled in the same configuration as original installation. Mechancial equipment and light pole installation only.  No electrical and instrumenation needed. This request is considered to be sole source to the University of Tulsa, Tulsa, OK, because their personnel are uniquely qualified to perform the required tasks and the following reasons: They have the opportunity to obtain a flow loop donated by Marathon Oil Company.  They offer a unique opportunity in that it will provide research opportunities for studies in the important area of hydrates formation and mitigation in oil and gas production facilities. These studies are particularly important in offshore Gulf of Mexico oil and gas developments, where hydrate formation has hindered production in many fields. In anticipation of this opportunity, an industry consortium is being formed to take advantage of forthcoming studies in basic and applied hydrates research. Utilizing industry technical experience and expertise, the availability of the flow loop, and graduate students from the University of Tulsa pursuing advanced degrees, significant studies and progress in this vital area of study is anticipated.  The state of the art studies of hydrate formation and mitigation, utilizing unique facilities and equipment gifted to the University of Tulsa, will provide the means for companies to supplement or supplant their own basic and applied research programs at a nominal cost.  The University of Tulsa has unique expertise in fluid flow testing, has operational drilling and wax/asphaltene research flow loop facilities, and has conducted many joint industry-university research ventures in the past. This request is considered to be sole source to the University of Tulsa, Tulsa, OK.   Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  This award shall be made using simplified acquisition procedures.  Requests for solicitation will be considered non-responsive.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS. Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770 and e-mail mohn@netl.doe.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS .  DO NOT PROVIDE A PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  This is a Sources Sought Synopsis as well as a Request for Information for an advertising agency to publish leg notices for the United States Marshals Service.  The purpose of this synopsis is to (1) determine interest and capability and (2) obtain input from industry sources.  The USMS is seeking a full service advertising agency to assume responsibility for publishing legal notices.  The proposed contract will require the successful contractor to publish notices of judicial forfeiture actions in newspapers of general circulation in the 11 judicial circuits, and in the District of Columbia judicial circuit.  The text of the legal notices shall be prepared by the Government and transmitted to the contractor by task order. The successful contractor will arrange for publication in newspapers located within the judicial district where the property is located, and/or in the judicial circuits where the action was filed.  In addition to the text of the notices, the task order shall state the judicial circuits where the notices must be published, the first date of publication, and the number of times the notice must be published.  The successful contractor will be required to publish the notices in newspapers of general circulation as that term is defined in the industry, and to provide the Government appropriate certifications that the notices have been published.  The successful contractor will be required to provide account management, invoicing and record keeping of notices published.  

The USMS may award a single national contract, or multiple circuit contracts, with a potential performance period of five years, considering the base year and the four option years.  A single award may include all judicial circuits; multiple awards may include several judicial circuits.  The USMS is interested in industry ideas/suggestions as to the best method of identifying newspaper(s) in each judicial circuit that would be considered Anewspapers of general circulation", and that offer or could offer the lowest publication costs.  The USMS also is interested in how the services could be obtained using electronic data transmission and/or other electronic communications media.  We anticipate a Firm Fixed Price contract with reimbursable line items for actual publication costs.  Interested offerors should submit in writing  ideas/suggestions and identify whether it is a small or large business concern.  All responses should be submitted to Carolyn Hendrick, Contract Specialist, via e-mail at: Carolyn.Hendrick@usdoj.gov or fax to (202)353-1420, by June 20,2002.

<DESC>**** This modification serves as notice that the due date for submission of proposals is hereby extended to June 1, 2002.  All other terms of the solicitation remain unchanged.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;  a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is Solicitation Notice No. AB133F-02-RP-0077.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 97-25. 

The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), is contracting for submersible dive days in waters around the central Aleutian Islands.  About seventeen days will be requested in July 2002, depending on availability of funds.  The submersible will be used to study the ecology and distribution of coral, evaluate the impact of fishing gear on seafloor habitat, and estimate commercially important demersal fish species on the continental shelf of both the Bering Sea and the North Pacific side of the islands.  The main purpose of this study is to collect live samples and video footage along a bathymetric gradient from approximately 30 to 350 m depth.  Vertebrates and invertebrates will be quantified from a downward oriented video camera, and from counts by a scientist viewing along the seafloor.  The submersible will be required to maintain a near constant depth off the seafloor and travel at fixed headings.  Performance capability of the contracted dive system is critical to the success of this research.  The total submersible system shall consist of a manned submersible, support ship, launch and retrieval system, competent crew, scientific laboratory space, and special equipment as specified below.  The charter contract will begin in Adak, Alaska and end in either Adak or Dutch Harbor, Alaska.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) is seeking sources for the lease of high 
resolution, rapid-update scanning sonar for the study of fish behavior in and 
around pelagic trawls. The sonar and lease terms must meet the following specifications:
1.Sonar resolution- The sonar must have sufficient resolution to distinguish fish body shapes at a range of 8 meters, requiring pixels smaller than of 1 x 2 inches at that range. All pixels in the image must be refreshed more than 10 times per second at 8 m range. Vendors will provide image sequences that demonstrate these capabilities.2. Sonar imaging area - The sonar will image across sector at least 20 degrees wide with a maximum range of at least 20 m. The sonar will not detect objects more than 10 degrees above or below the beam.3. Sonar size - The sonar head must be compact, for ease of handling, rigging and protection on the trawls, and must be light enough (in water) to require minimum floatation. This would be fulfilled by a largest dimension (height, width or length) less than 16 inches and weight in water less than 2 kg. 4. Operation over cable: When connected to the surface by a cable (at least 400 feet long, vendor provided) the sonar will display full resolution images on a vendor-supplied control/display system or a government-supplied computer running provided software on Microsoft Windows. Control system or software will allow real time adjustment of sonar parameters, including range and gain and will continuously store image data which can be replayed at full resolution, including all image frames.
5. Autonomous operation: The sonar must be capable of autonomous operation for at least one hour when connected to a government-provided underwater battery pack of 10 amp-hours at 24 volts or 20 amp-hour of 12 volts.

<DESC>The Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Ship Systems Engineering Station, (NSWCCD-SSES) is in the process of standardizing general cleaning materials used aboard U.S. Navy Ships.  Presently, ships carry a large variety of cleaning supplies necessary for routine maintenance and shipboard sanitation.  These products can vary in both cleaning efficiency and the degree of safety and health precautions necessary for their use.  NSWCCD-SSES has developed Technical Purchase Descriptions (TPDs) for those cleaning applications required aboard ship.  The overall goal of this initiative is to improve the safety and health aspects (i.e., reduce personal protective equipment requirements (PPE)), and environmental friendliness of the cleaning products that the Navy uses afloat without compromising the mission.  A secondary goal is to eliminate those categories of mate rials, which are not needed aboard ship.   NSWCCD-SSES is soliciting manufacturers' product information (i.e., Material Safety Data Sheets, cleaning efficiency, etc) for cleaning compounds and also a chemical cleaning compound dispensing system that meet the requirements listed in the TPDs.  The following cleaning compound categories have been identified for shipboard application: food contact sanitizer concentrate; non-food contact disinfectant cleaner concentrate; ready to use general purpose cleaner; glass cleaners (concentrates or ready to use); heavy duty general purpose cleaner concentrate; floor finish restorer concentrate; floor strippers; machinery and bilge cleaner/degreaser concentrate; light to medium duty cleaners (powder); and a dispensing system.  The ten TPDs describing the requirements for the listed cleaning applications are posted at http://www.dt.navy. mil/acquisition (see link below)under the category of "Announcements".  Also, the cleaning product submissions attachment explains documentation submittals and the appropriate activity (NSWCCD-SSES or the Naval Environmental Health Center (NEHC)). All documentation for cleaning products shall be submitted to the appropriate activity no later than  22 June 2002.  No product will be considered for catalogue inclusion if a complete documentation package has not been submitted for evaluation.  Please contact Ms.Christine Socha (215) 897-7499 or Ms. Sarah Phillips (215) 897-7401, if further information is required.
