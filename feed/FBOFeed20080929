THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. Interested sources should contact Ms. Robin Gibson, Contract Specialist, 850-883-0263 or Steve Wall, Contracting Officer, 850-883-0844. For technical information, contact Ms. Missy Ward, Program Manager, 850-883-0920. Collect calls will not be accepted.

When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or Program Manager.

<DESC>GSA Heartland Global Supply intends to establish a "not to exceed" one-year Standing Price Quote (SPQ) for one (1) National Stock Number in the 8020 Federal Supply Class.  Please see the attached Word Doc for a complete description.  All quotes should meet the requirements of the attached Item Purchase Description.  Please note that an SPQ is not a formal contract.  While we call it a one-year SPQ it is not in any way binding for the vendor or the government.  If the vendor has a price increase during the one year period, the vendor will need to contact the government and the appropriate action will be taken.  In this case, the higher price will either be authorized or the government will cancel the SPQ and re-advertise it on FedBizOps.  Also if the vendor can no longer provide the item for any reason, the vendor will need to contact the government and the orders will be stopped.  For questions please contact Clarissa D. McDaniel, Contract Specialist, at 816-823-1290.  Please e-mail (preferred) or fax your quotes to Clarissa D. McDaniel at 816-823-3109 by October 1, 2008.

The support services required for this Mission Critical Defense System consist of the following: system engineering, program management, software engineering, logistical support, training device upgrades, fielding and field support, depot support, testing and limited production capabilities.&nbsp; The supported systems and equipment include, but are not limited to the AN/TTC/TYC-39 and the Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) Family of Switches, switch components, and derivative variants, including export versions for foreign military sales (IMSE) and enhancements provided as part of the Area Common User System Modernization Program (ACUS MOD).&nbsp; This equipment operates the TRI-TAC (Tri-Service Tactical Communications)/ACUS System and MSE and its derivative systems for all of the Army EAC, ECB, and International customers.</span></p>
<p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The&nbsp;Mission Critical Defense System is a tactical communication legacy system that has been in the military inventory for a number of years. This system provides secure voice, data and satellite communications between battlefield commanders and for the soldiers in the field. This system is vital to military operations and other Joint Defense missions worldwide. As this system is deployed, it requires support, maintenance, unscheduled upgrades and the procurement of additional hardware and software. As this equipment continues to age, it will require a wide range of technical and field support services. The support furnished through this contract is needed to ensure that this legacy equipment provides the communications essential to military forces.&nbsp; The total replacement of the system described above is anticipated to occur&nbsp;approximately in the year 2012. Until that replacement takes place, meeting the requirements contained within this acquisition is essential to the military's communications capabilities, and will ensure that PM CP can meet their worldwide mission of providing life cycle management, maintenance, enhancements, refinements, and improvements to the unique and proprietary mission critical defense system.</span></p>

The technical staff of PM CP and GSA conducted a review and analysis of&nbsp;respondent capabilities. PM CP concluded that none of the vendors other than General Dynamics C4S are capable of fulfilling the PM CP requirements that are included in this acquisition without a significant or total disruption to the PM CP Programs.</span></p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a Pre-solicitation Notice to provide a synopsis of a proposed contract solicitation to interested parties.  This Notice does not require a response from interested parties nor does it commit the Government to solicit or award a contract.

Background
The Rural Development area within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is the lead federal entity in rural economic and community development.  Rural Development accomplishes its mission by providing assistance to rural America through a network of 47 state offices and numerous other field office locations covering 50 states, plus the Pacific Trust Territories, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Rural Developments headquarters is located in Washington, District of Columbia, with additional operations in St. Louis, Missouri.

Synopsis
USDA Rural Development (Agency) intends to obtain technical support services to provide maintenance support and enhancement development to one of its official accounting and financial management systems - Automated Multi-housing Accounting System (AMAS).  The Agency, as part of supporting its overall role in providing agricultural credit and rural development assistance for the Multiple Family Housing (MFH) loan and grant program, has initiated activities to develop and enhance Agency information management.  The continued shift from internal Agency automated systems used by USDA employees to a combination of internal, intranet and internet systems serving our varied customers mandates improved and responsive automation support.  

The AMAS loan portfolio contains approximately 21,000 loans with an outstanding principal balance in excess of $11.8 billion.  AMAS currently consists of about 400 COBOL (600,000 lines of code) programs and 9 subsystems.  The on-line system is written primarily in ADS-0 with some usage of DC-COBOL, and is made up of about 300 maps and dialogs.  There are approximately 300 Job Control Language (JCL) members.  Structured programming techniques have been used.  The choice of development tool set and architecture will be determined by the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) using the suite of tools approved by the Agency.  The various automated components, which support the Agency loan programs, are at different stages of development effort in an attempt to meet E-File/GPEA mandates.  The architecture of these components is evolving from a pure block-mode, mainframe environment to one of web-enabled intranet, extranet, and internet capabilities interfacing with some legacy processes.  Common processes are being shared between programs where feasible to reduce maintenance overhead.  All new development is aimed at re-usability among programs.

Rural Development requires software maintenance and enhancement support for AMAS.  This may include supporting documentation modifications and/or improvements, designing and/or developing software maintenance/enhancements, testing, supporting data base changes, and supporting any new technologies that are introduced.  Various requests for data occur sporadically through the year, coming from Office of Inspector General (OIG), General Accounting Office (GAO), or Congressional requests.  These requests must also be fulfilled as part of the work duties assigned.  Additionally, the Agency direct loan and grant programs automated components must comply with OMB Circular A-129 performance goals, the Treasury Financial Manual, Circular A-123 guidance for internal control systems, Circular A-127 guidance for financial management systems, and Circular A-130, guidance for security requirements.  Consideration must also be given to the JFMIP Government-Wide systems automation requirements and the E-File/GPEA initiatives.

Acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items procedures.  Full and Open competition will be exercised.  The Government intends to award a single contract to the offeror who provides the best value to the Government.  The contract will be for one (1) base year with four (4) option years to be exercised by the Government if found to be in its best interest.  The approximate solicitation release date is May 27, 2008.  The solicitation will be available and distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities website: http://www.fbo.gov .  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation and any amendments, will be distributed solely through the website listed.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  Offerors must obtain a DUNS number and register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov ) in order to transact business with USDA.

Inquiries will only be accepted by email to the Point of Contact listed below.

Interested parties shall submit proposals containing relevant pricing and service information as specified in the solicitation.  Proposals must be received by 2:00 pm ET on June 13, 2008, and should be submitted electronically as instructed in the solicitation.

Proposal Submission Place:
Mr. Rajesh Wadhawan, Chief Manager-Inspection
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), Refinery
Mahul, Mumbai - 400074, India
Phone: 25533888

Fax: 91-22-25546003

BPCL Asset Integrity Management Project:
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for an Asset Integrity Management (AIM) project for its petroleum refineries and associated pipelines.

The Grantee, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), is seeking to develop a comprehensive program of AIM that it intends to apply at its Mumbai refinery.  This type of program involves world class standards of inspection and maintenance of refinery facilities and pipelines to ensure the uninterrupted, reliable and efficient operation.  This program, which utilizes advanced technologies and methodologies, is vital to minimize the risks and vulnerabilities of large scale petroleum operations, protect the safety of the workforce and neighboring population, and to maximize energy security for India.

The Technical Assistance would examine BPCL's refinery in Mumbai and train BPCL personnel on a comprehensive strategy for evaluating risk to petroleum refineries and related facilities, and would demonstrate a wide range of advanced technologies available from the United States at BPCL's Mumbai refinery.  The training and field demonstrations will be open to select individuals from other Indian refining companies and also to the Oil Industry Safety Directorate, which is the safety regulatory body for refineries, pipelines, and storage facilities under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.  OISD has indicated that, based on the results of this Technical Assistance, it would consider modifying standards and regulations regarding inspections to have refiners apply these new methodologies and technologies to other refineries throughout India.

The overall technical assistance shall: (1) Analyze the current AIM program and recommend steps to improve and optimize the current AIM program in accordance with US and international recommended practices (Gap Analysis), (2) provide the necessary training to Grantee personnel that will enable them to more effectively make improvements and better understand how these improvements will be utilized in their day-to-day decision making process, (3) address several key areas in which the Grantee has identified a requirement for technical assistance and (4) provide a technology demonstration to show how key technologies are utilized to enhance the safety and the integrity of petroleum refining operations to better ensure the reliability of meeting its petroleum products supply obligations to the Indian market.

BPCL is a large public sector company in India whose core business is the refining of crude oil and the marketing of petroleum products.  BPCL operates two large refineries in Mumbai and Kochi with a combined refining capacity of 19.5 MMTPA (million tons per annum).  BPCL also has majority equity interest in a third refinery (Numaligarh Refinery Limited in Assam) with 3.0 MMTPA of capacity.  In total, this accounts for about 15 percent of India's current refining capacity.

The Terms of Reference for this Technical Assistance will include:

Task 1:	Mobilization
Task 2:	Initial project meeting and site surveys
Task 3: 	AIM Program Analysis (Gap Analysis) & Audit
Task 4: 	Advanced Technology Field Demonstrations 
Task 5: 	Technical Training Addressing Key BPCL Issues 
Task 6:	Conduct technical evaluation
Task 7: 	Preliminary environmental impact assessment
Task 8: 	Development impact assessment
Task 9: 	Prepare cost estimates and economic assessment
Task 10: 	Provide list of equipment and technology suppliers
Task 11: 	Training program recommendations
Task 12: 	Final Report	 	

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $370,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). The Grantee will provide an additional U.S. $63,310 in cost share contribution, for a total of U.S. $433,310.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:

https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 3:00PM, November 12, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

As required of FAR 6.302-1( c ), each justification shall include the following information:  1.	Requesting Agency:	Department of Veterans AffairsContracting Activity:	Austin Information Technology Center (AITC)1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX 787722.	Nature and/or description of the action:  We are requesting Belden/XMark cabinets due to the compatibility with what we already have installed.  Cabinets must be bolted (or "ganged") to existing cabinets to prevent tipping.  Also, the desire is to present an aesthetic appearance rather than a hodge-podge mix of cabinets.3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):  We need 15 Custom Belden XMark Ultra-Deep Server Cabinets for mounting new servers and equipment as the AITC grows.4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.    FAR Part 6.302-1   "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements"5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. Purchase of Belden/XMark cabinets will allow us to continue to use mounting hardware and shelves that we currently have in stock, rather than having to maintain a separate inventory or parts.6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  This requirement will be solicited on FedBizOps as an open market requirement since the required cabinets are custom-made and are not on any contractor's GSA schedule as of yet, which will allow many resellers to compete for this requirement. 7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  The previous price competition for Belden cabinets ensures that the pricing of the later orders will be considered fair and reasonable. 8.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  This item is not widely available on SEWP and GSA schedule.  By searching on the part number in the established catalog or price lists available at the websites of http://www.sewp.nasa.gov and http://www.gsaadvantage.gov it can be shown that there are no vendors able to compete for this requirement. 9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: (i)	Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. (ii)	When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. (iii)	When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government. N/A10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.N/A 11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.See the answer to questions 8 and 5. 12.	Certification requirement:  (Technical/requirements personnel must certify).I certify the supporting data, including the statement of the Government's minimum needs and other rationale for other than full and open competition is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge./s/ Gary Wood	9/26/2008Signature of Technical/Requirements Representative	Date		This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief./s/ Sylvia Thomas	26 September 2008Contract Specialist	Date

<a href="mailto:philmore.crichlowjr@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to award a sole source contract to Perimed. Inc., 6785 Wallings Road., Suite 2C, North Royalton, OH  44133 to allow purchase of a PeriScan PIM 3 System.To support needed requirements, the PeriScan PIM 3 System is a Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging system for non-invasive imaging of superficial tissue blood perfusion.  This technique can be used to monitor microcirculatory activity in healthy and diseased tissue, show basal values and also responses resulting from an applied physiological stimulus, a provocation. Based on the Doppler principle, two-dimensional maps (imaging mode) or time traces (monitoring mode) of the tissue blood perfusion can be created. Easy-to-use image analysis software (LDPIwin) assists in the evaluation of the results and in report generation. The patented stepwise laser beam movement makes it possible to read low perfused areas. Since no physical contact with the tissue is necessary, and no dyes or tracer elements are used, the influence on the perfusion can be kept to a minimum. These features also imply that repeated clinical investigations (such as healing wounds and leg ulcers) can be performed without the additional risk of contamination, infection or discomfort to the patient. This equipment will be used to measure the blood flow of ischemia limb or wound healing in mice.The sole source acquisition is enacted in accordance with existing authority under FAR 6.302-1.The period of performance will begin on 30, September 2008.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this acquisition are 423450 with a small business size standard of 100 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responsible sources interested in this procurement shall submit on their company letterhead a statement, which contains clear and convincing information identifying their capabilities to provide the service.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in writing no later than 11:00 am local time, September 30, 2008 to Phil Crichlow, via email at Philmore.CrichlowJr@va.gov or mail information to VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (90C-H), Attention, Phil Crichlow, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15206.  Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by email or mail to the addresses provided.  If no responses are received, the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System will proceed with sole source negotiations with Perimed, Inc.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Emergency and Environmental Health Services (EEHS) contemplates award of an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract on or about May 1, 2008.  The contemplated contract will have a one-year base period and four, one-year options.  The total estimated ceiling price is $50 Million (approximately $10 Million per year).  Individual task orders may be either firm-fixed-price (FFP) or cost plus fixed fee (CPFF).  The attached draft statement of work describes the requirement in detail.  Included with the draft statement of work are the evaluation criteria and sample task order projects representative of the organization?s anticipated requirements.  Such samples should not be considered a comprehensive representation of all requirements.
1. Capability Statement:  Interested offerors are requested to submit a capability statement to the contracting officer Mr. Lionel (Lee) Nadeau, CDC Procurement and Grants Office, via e-mail at lnadeau@cdc.gov no later than January 25, 2007.  The capability statement should, as a minimum, address the following topics:

a.	Describe your organization?s experiences which relate to the statement of work occurring during the previous three years from the date of this synopsis.  Briefly explain the relationship to the draft statement of work. The attached project samples may also be considered for purposes of identifying and describing relevant experience.  Identify the period of contract performance and dollar value of the contract for the experiences submitted.
b.	Describe the breadth and scope of technical expertise and experience relative to the 10 primary tasks identified in the draft statement of work.
c.	Describe your organization?s capacity to support the diverse needs described in the draft statement of work.  What specific resources does your organization have available to support the requirement?  Describe the depth and breadth of the personnel expertise within your organization as related to the requirements described in the draft statement of work.
d.	Explain your organization?s ability to quickly identify appropriate technical personnel that may not be available from within your organization.  If possible, provide specific examples of successful accomplishments that demonstrate timely responses to provide technical personnel outside your organization upon short notice.  

Respondents are cautioned that ?standard? marketing brochures may not provide sufficient and specific information to enable the government to evaluate an offeror?s capabilities relative to the contemplated requirement (as reflected in the draft statement of work) and thus offerors should tailor the capability statement accordingly.  The capability statement is limited to 10 pages.  

2. Comments to Draft Statement of Work and Evaluation Criteria:  in addition to submitting a capability statement, offerors are invited to submit comments to the draft statement of work and evaluation criteria.  Due to time constraints and limited resources, the government does not  intend to respond to specific questions at this time but will consider comments and questions received in developing the final statement of work and evaluation criteria.

3. Business Size Status: The government will evaluate responses to this sources sought synopsis to determine the acquisition strategy (e.g. full and open competition versus a set aside).  Accordingly, offerors are requested to indicate their business size status relative to the NAICS code 541690 $6.5 Million and indicate any other applicable socio-economic business subcategory status (e.g. HUBZone, Small Disadvantage Business etc.).

Offerors? responses should be divided into three, distinct sections as follows:  1. Capability Statement; 2. Comments to Draft Statement of Work (as applicable); 3.  Business Size status.  

This sources sought synopsis does not obligate the government and is submitted as market research for acquisition planning purposes.  Offerors responding to this synopsis do so voluntarily and assume all costs incurred in preparing and submitting such response.  This synopsis is not a solicitation and therefore formal proposals are neither requested nor required.  Thus the CDC will reject any such proposals received in response to this sources sought synopsis.

<DESC>The government intends to issue a purchase order for the items set forth below, subject to availability of FY 09 funds.  The Office of Communications and Outreach intends to contract for services from Press Association (450 West 33rd Street, New York, NY 10001-2603), the nations oldest, largest, and most widely cited news wire service, for a period of twelve months, from October 2008 to September 2008.  This service meets our needs to access up-to-date and breaking news on national, state, and local levels by providing exclusive on-line access to their AP Internet, Washington Report, and Education Alert and Daybook services for approximately 100 users.  The AP Daybook provides target breaking news from the 50 U.S. states and Washington, DC and can provide a full news report for each state.  This service also provides a first hand coverage that supports strategic planning and keeps staff on top of developing stories; offers private, internal access to the full stream of APs premium state coverage; delivers intelligence that can track information on the U.S. Department of Education; and allows users to stay updated on education issues.  In addition the Daybook service can provide a schedule of metro and statewide special events, including news conferences, speeches, announcements, meetings, hearings, and other major news events.

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the government will consider all proposals received within 10 days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responsible sources may submit a bid or quotation, which, if received timely, will be considered.

<a href="mailto:donald.kelley@usmc.mil">Technical Point of Contact</a>
<DESC>Background: The USMC CREW program office has procured 10,089 CREW systems.  CREW systems are high power, modular, programmable, multiband radio frequency jammers designed to deny enemy use of selected portions of the radio frequency spectrum.  The USMC CREW systems, Hunter and Chameleon, are proprietary NDI systems.  The USMC CREW systems have been fielded in Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF), and as part of the USMC Maritime Expeditionary Units (MEU's).
Purpose: The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit interest in the conduct of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) for the USMC CREW Program.  Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is looking for potential sources to perform the role of Product Support Integrator (PSI) for USMC CREW systems.  In Accordance With (IAW) MCO 4000.57 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems. A PSI is an entity (i.e., individual, organization - public or private sector) charged with integrating all public and private support sources, defined within the scope of Performance Based Agreements (PBA), to achieve the documented performance outcomes.  The Marine Corps will implement the PSI  approach for fielded USMC CREW systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint, ! and reduction in logistics costs. The selected PSI will be responsible for all or portions of the system supportability and logistics support, which could include, but is not limited to, system installation, supply chain management (spares support), field and sustainment level maintenance (scheduled and unscheduled), warranty tracking, data management, and operator and maintenance training.   Logistics support requirements are in CONUS and OCONUS locations.  Field Service Representative support and presence at OCONUS US CENTRAL COMMAND (CENTCOM) Area of Operation (AOR) is required.   System support processes will be transparent to the war fighter.   
Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Performance Fee Contract for up to six (6) years. 
Goals: Desired Results and Outcomes: Expected performance results from the PSI for the USMC CREW systems is achievement of efficiencies that reduce the logistics footprint; reduce logistics delay time, and reduce maintenance cost.  Ultimately the goal is the reduction of Operations and Sustainment (O&S) costs to the Marine Corps and increase mission availability.  
Measurements: Level of performance shall be expressed in measurable outcomes and achievement of those outcomes by objective evaluation. 
SURVEY QUESTIONAIRE FOR THE USMC CREW PRODUCT SUPPORT INTEGRATOR (PSI) FOR USMC CREW SYSTEMS 
The following will not be shared outside of the USMC CREW program office.
Name of Company: Address: City, State, Zip Code: Point of Contact (POC) information: Name: Telephone Number: Email Address: Website Address: What is the business of your company; i.e. large business, small business, 8 (a), etc. 
1. Describe your company's experience, if any, in providing PBL support to USMC , other DOD component/s, or industry.  2. Have you successfully performed in the role of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider on any other USMC,  other DoD, or industry system? If so, on which systems and what was the extent of the support provided? 3. If you have performed under a PBL contract in the past, what are some of the best practices you have used to be successful? 4. What would be your plan for managing the supply chain (parts support) for field (intermediate) and sustainment (depot) level maintenance?  5. What potential constraints and boundaries do you anticipate within the responsibilities of managing a PBL support contract? 6. How do you propose the government should measure the specific areas of performance metrics related to reducing the logistics footprint, reducing maintenance/repair times, increasing mission availability and reducing total logistics delay time? What recommendations can your organization provide? 7. What would be your plan for reducing maintenance/repair times for scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance?8.

<DESC>Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold AFB, Tennessee, provides test and evaluation services to defense contractors, as well as other commercial customers who cannot reasonably obtain such testing in the private sector. AEDC is part of the national Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), a broad base of test and evaluation activities which support Department of Defense (DoD) missions, but are also available to other users having a valid requirement for such capabilities. This notice is provided in compliance with DoD policy to ensure MRTFB activities do not compete with private industry for non-DoD test and evaluation support. DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this synopsis is to provide public notice of the non-DoD test support AEDC anticipates providing to commercial customers in Fiscal Year 2009 and to invite private sector expressions of capability to perform such test and evaluation services. The nature of this work is expected to include the following: Measure jet engine performance at altitude simulation up to 80,000 feet for an engine producing 2,000 lbs of thrust up to 100,000 lbs of thrust and inlet total temperature up to 660 deg R; Measure aerothermal heat distribution on a hypersonic configuration at high Reynolds Number; Simulate engine icing; Measure the performance of a high area ratio nozzle at 100,000 ft altitude; Measure the aerodynamic characteristics during supersonic separation of a "shuttle-like" launch configuration; Perform preflight qualification and checkout of full scale satellites; Measure aerodynamic loads/pressures on flight vehicles at subsonic, transonic and supersonic speeds; Obtain store loads and store separation data at transonic and supersonic speeds; Measure aerodynamic and propulsion performance characteristics at subsonic, transonic and supersonic speeds; Measure aerodynamic and aeroelastic performance characteristics of helicopter rotor systems at subsonic speeds; Conduct computer simulations, modeling, and analysis of internal and external aerodynamic flow; Assess structural integrity and evaluate aerodynamic stability of projectile at specified launch conditions; Collect nose cone ablation measurements and impact lethality data and measure pressure and stress wave propagation during impact; Collect and analyze target debris to provide assessment of kill effectiveness; Application of information technology as applicable to weapon system development; Provide real-time radiography support for solid rocket motor testing; and, Develop diagnostic techniques and devise the effective application thereof for the characterization of effects of real and simulated space environments on aerospace materials. INSTRUCTIONS: Interested firms may at any time submit descriptions of their capabilities to support requirements such as those listed above.  AEDC will maintain these submissions and make them available to prospective commercial customers for their use in determining private sector enterprises that may be able to satisfy their requirements.  Responses should be provided to AEDC/PKE, ATTN: Sue Tate, 100 Kindel Drive, Suite A332, Arnold AFB TN 37389-1332.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopcom.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.

PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND:  Announcement N00164-07-R-4831 was released to determine potential sources for a Weapon Shot Counter (WSC) compatible with the Special Forces Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) family of weapons.  Amendment 0001 presented a draft performance specification for WSC-SCAR for industry comment and an invitation to industry to attend a pre-solicitation conference.  The purpose of this announcement is to provide an update on the progress of this program and offer data that may help potential vendors calibrate their technologies for the SCAR family of weapons.      
PROGRAM UPDATE:  The performance specification is currently being reviewed by USSOCOM's Requirements Group. The release of an approved performance specification is not anticipated until early 2009.  Issuance of a solicitation for this effort is tentatively planned for 26 January 2009.
GFI:  To assist potential vendors in the calibration of their technologies, Government-collected weapon shock profile data is being offered in the form of a test report.  The report only presents the weapon shock profile as measured from one location on the SCAR-L and SCAR-H.  This data is not to be construed as guidance for where the WSC is to be placed; the approved performance specification will address placement.  All requests for this data should be directed to Mr. Jason M. Davis, WSC Project Manager, Code JXNLM, telephone 812-854-6855, fax 812-854-3749, Email: jason.m.davis3@navy.mil.             
Questions should be directed to Ms. Stacy McAtee, Contracting Officer, Code 0562NS, telephone 812-854-1988, fax 812-854-5095, e-mail stacy.mcatee@navy.mil.  Complete mailing address is: Code 0562NS, Bldg. 3422, NSWC Crane, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN  47522-5001.

The LabChip 90 System is a multi-purpose chip-based, automated electrophoresis system for h protein, DNA, and RNA fragment analysis with the following product features and specifications:

LabChip Technology
Size:  The LabChip 90 is a compact floor standing instrument that is completely enclosed.  The
instrument occupies only 23" width x 24" depth of floor space.

Addition of Internal Standards for Accurate Quantitation and Sizing.  The LabChip devices
automatically add internal markers to each sample on-chip.

Single Sipper Chip for DNA, RNA, or Protein.

High Resolution Electrophoresis.  Proteins, DNA, and RNA fragments are separated in
microchannels filled with a sieving polymer solution and a fluorescent dye.  The stained
proteins, DNA, or RNA fragments form sharp bands, resulting in exceptional peak resolution.

On Chip Detection.  Each protein, DNA, or RNA fragment is detected as it passes through a tightly focused laser beam.  Low concentrations are easily measured.  Protein concentrations
are quantitatively detected to 5 ng/L.  DNA concentrations are quantitatively detected as low
as 1 ng/L.  RNA linear range is down to 5ng/l.

Less Sample Preparation is needed.  The LabChip 90 is tolerant of protein samples with
detergents (for example, Triton X-100 up to 1 %) or salt (up to 1 M NaCI).  DNA samples can
be run after PCR reactions without further clean-up.

LabChip 90 System Hardware
Automated Sampling from Microtiter Plates.  The LabChip 90 System features walk-away
automation for unattended sampling of 96-Well and 384-Well plates.  A calibration standard is
run every 12 samples to provide exceptional sizing, accuracy, and quantitation.

Precise Control of Chip Voltages, Currents and Pressure.  By controlling these parameters
independently, multiple laboratory operations can be integrated onto a single chip.

Laser-Induced Fluorescence for High Sensitivity Detection.  The optical system features auto-alignment and auto-focus of a solid-state laser for optimal sensitivity and reproducible chip-to-chip operation.

Chips are easily and quickly loaded.  The LabChip 90 chips have a 10 minute preparation
cycle prior to first use.  Competing technologies require a 1.5 hour chip prep time.

Up to 400 samples can be run on one chip preparation.  The analysis time for a 96-well plate
for RNA is 150 minutes, DNA is 45 minutes, protein is 75 minutes.  After preparation, all chips
can be used over an 8 hour period, so smaller sets of sample can be run continuously
throughout the work day.  Can use 96 or 384 plates for RNA, DNA, or Protein samples.

LabChip HT Software
Eliminates Photographic Gel Documentation.  Digital data provides higher quality results than
standard gel electrophoresis.  There is a cost savings because an additional imager and
software are not required.  There is also a time savings as the operator does not need to
transfer the gel to another instrument for analysis.
 
Automatic Sizing and Quantitation.  The size and concentration of each fragment are
calculated and reported automatically in tabular format.

Automatic Data Export.  All run data can be automatically exported for further analysis or
archival storage.

Point-and-Click Data Overlay.  The data overlay feature allows detailed sample comparisons,
making sample to sample comparisons easy.

Intuitive Data Image.  Gel-like data image is similar to slab gel results.

DataViewer Software
Facilitates data comparisons across multiple plates.  Both 96 and 384-well plates can be
pulled into the workspace to allow sample selections to be included in a 'collection' which is
subjected to the same analyses as offered in the LabChip HT software.

Data displays in virtual gel, electropherogram, of summary table formats.  Data exports in any
of the display formats.

Provides powerful filter functions to enable data queries in regards to variable settings.
Variable selections can be combined to elevate the sensitivity of the filters.  Filters can be
saved as templates for subsequent use to analyze plates.

Caliper Life Sciences is the sole manufacturer of the LabChip 90 System.  There is no equivalent product on the market.  The instrument is and its individual components are patented by Caliper Life Sciences.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

As required of FAR 6.302-1( c ), each justification shall include the following information:  1.	Requesting Agency:	Department of Veterans AffairsContracting Activity:	Austin Information Technology Center (AITC)1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX 787722.	Nature and/or description of the action:  We are requesting Belden/XMark cabinets due to the compatibility with what we already have installed.  Cabinets must be bolted (or "ganged") to existing cabinets to prevent tipping.  Also, the desire is to present an aesthetic appearance rather than a hodge-podge mix of cabinets.3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):  We need 15 Custom Belden XMark Ultra-Deep Server Cabinets for mounting new servers and equipment as the AITC grows.4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.    FAR Part 6.302-1   "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements"5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. Purchase of Belden/XMark cabinets will allow us to continue to use mounting hardware and shelves that we currently have in stock, rather than having to maintain a separate inventory or parts.6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  This requirement will be solicited on FedBizOps as an open market requirement since the required cabinets are custom-made and are not on any contractor's GSA schedule as of yet, which will allow many resellers to compete for this requirement. 7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  The previous price competition for Belden cabinets ensures that the pricing of the later orders will be considered fair and reasonable. 8.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  This item is not widely available on SEWP and GSA schedule.  By searching on the part number in the established catalog or price lists available at the websites of http://www.sewp.nasa.gov and http://www.gsaadvantage.gov it can be shown that there are no vendors able to compete for this requirement. 9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: (i)	Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. (ii)	When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. (iii)	When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government. N/A10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.N/A 11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.See the answer to questions 8 and 5. 12.	Certification requirement:  (Technical/requirements personnel must certify).I certify the supporting data, including the statement of the Government's minimum needs and other rationale for other than full and open competition is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge./s/ Gary Wood	9/26/2008Signature of Technical/Requirements Representative	Date		This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief./s/ Sylvia Thomas	26 September 2008Contract Specialist	Date

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested (use attached bid sheet) and a written solicitation will not be issued. Alternate proposals are not allowed. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions.&nbsp;The solicitation number (F1J5AF8213A002) is issued as a request for proposal (RFP) which will result in a Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract(IDIQ). This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.&nbsp;This solicitation is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The associated NAICS code is 518210, and the small business size standard is $25M.&nbsp;This requirement consists of three (3) contract line items numbers (CLINS):0001 - FFP - MicroFiche Scanning Services; 0002 - FFP - Microfilm Scanning Services - 16MM Continuous; and 0003 - FFP - Microfilm Scanning - 16MM Mixed . Period of Performance under this contract shall be from effective date of award through 30 Sep 2010. Description: The Contractor shall provide scanning services to the Aeromedical Consultation Service - ECG Library IAW Performance Work Statement, dated 21 August 2008. The place of performance will be at the contractor site. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this solicitation. The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this solicitation. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1.) Technical approach to meet the requirements of the Performance Work Statement. The technical approach should include steps to ensure HIPPA compliance while handling and transporting materials to be scanned. 2.) Past Performance. Past performance will be evaluated based on an assessment of the contractors submission of past performance information. Each offeror will be assigned one of the following performance confidence assessments:</p>
<p>TABLE 3- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS<br />Rating Description<br />Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>No Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br /><br />Unknown Confidence No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p><br />3) Price - The total evaluated price will be determined by multiplying the unit prices to the maximum quantity of images for CLINS 0001, 0002 and 0003. The three CLIN prices will be summed to determine the total evaluated price. Technical approach and past performance when combined are more important than price.&nbsp;A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. Evaluation procedures outlined in FAR 15.304 shall apply to the acquisition.

<a href="mailto:tiffany.boatwright@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>N65236-08-R-0210-0005- 29 September 2008The proposal and sample due date is hereby extended to 06 October 2008 at1400 EST.The Government has answered all relevant questions pertaining to thissolicitation.  At this point, the answers are repetitive.  All repetitivequestionswill be referred to the appropriate amendment where they have been previouslyanswered.   Offeror must acknowledge receipt of thisamendment prior to the offer due date listed herein in writing.  A simplestatement acknowledging receipt of amendment 0005 is sufficient.1. We understand that the Government requires a single cable carrying bothdata and audio signals. However, it and Harris P/N 12041-72320-A18 cannotpossibly plug into SPAWAR W5007-01 since the latter has no connector carryingboth data and audio, so can you tell us what cable it will plug into?Answer: The cable will plug into a modified W5007-1 that does carry the audiosignal through the DB-9/DE-9 connector.  A drawing of the modified cable is notavailable.  As stated in question number 4 on Amendment 0004 posted on 26September 2008, "The DB-9/DE-9 is capable of carrying the audio functionalityin lieu of utilizing the P10 and P12 on W5007-1."2. We need the pin assignments for the audio signals on the 32-pin and 9-pinconnectors. You suggest contacting Harris Corp. Can you provide a technicalPOC there?Answer: No, the Government cannot provide a Harris point of contact.N65236-08-R-0210-0004- 26 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions and provide clarificationfor this requirement.  The hour and date specified for receipt of offer isherebyextended to 02 October 2008 at 1400 EST. The original market survey andresulting solicitation both referenced the government's requirement for bothdata and audio signal supportability. Offeror must acknowledge receipt of thisamendment prior to the offer due date listed herein in writing.  A simplestatement acknowledging receipt of amendment 0004 is sufficient.1. It is impossible to know whether the screws are fixed or rotate on the 9-pinconnector picture posted. Can you post one with a side or angled view?Answer: No other views are available.2. The connector that you have called a DE-9F is properly designated as DE-9S.Answer: The 9 pin connector attaching mechanism required by the governmentin accordance with this solicitation is the same attaching mechanism per NSN5340-01-522-1658 stated in the solication.3.The drawing (W5007-1) is incomplete since there is no wiring diagram. Thiscable cannot be produced without it. The wiring diagram might be contained inthe drawings listed in Note 16. Can you post these?Answer: The government is not asking the offorers to build W5007-1.  Thegovernment reminds the offorers that the Harris Part number for the cable is12041-72320-A18 meets the governments requirements and may be used forreference.  The government recommends that any wiring questions be directedto the OEM.4. According to this drawing (W5007-1)  the audio is not carried through thecable under the solicitation. It is a data only cable. Audio is carrriedthroughconnectors P10 and P12 which must be connected to the radios to get audio.Answer: The government acknowledges that the audio may be carried throughconnector P10 and P12.  But that is not what the government requires.  The DB-9/DE-9 is capable of carrying the audio functionality in lieu of utilizing theP10and P12 on W5007-1.  The government's requirement is for a single cable thatsupports both data and audio signals.5. The SPAWAR cable drawing that posted (W5007-1) handles data on a 9-pinD connector and audio on a separate 6-pin connector. Therefore, the cable(requested under this solicitation) connecting the radio to the SPAWAR cablewould have to have two legs, one for audio and one for data. The 9-pinconnectors on the SPAWAR cable, according to Note 12 on the drawing only use3 pins (2,3 and 5), therefore they cannot carry both audio and data. So whatyou call a Audio and Data Cable is not possible as provided in the solicitationdrawing. Therefore, you have 2 options: (1) reconfigure the cable you want bygiving it 2 legs, one for data and one for audio; or (2) if you still want asingleleg cable as shown in the solicitation, it would have to plug into anothercabledifferent from the SPAWAR one, where a mating 9-pin connector would handleboth audio and data.Answer: See answer to question 4 above.25 September 2008- Drawings posted for SPAWAR W5007-1 CableN65236-08-R-0210-0003- 25 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions. Any questionssubmitted after the posting of this amendment may not be answered.  Thehour and date specified for receipt of offer is hereby extended to 29September 2008 at 10:00 AM EST.  Offeror must acknowledge receipt of thisamendment prior to the offer due date listed herein in writing.  A simplestatement acknowledging receipt of amendment 0003 is sufficient.1. Question: Are you specifying a connector with pins as opposed to sockets,i.e., a DE-9P, and that has female type locking screws?Answer:  There are no pins in the DB-9/DE-9.  The government requires thefemale type locking screws.  The Government does not understand theconfusion.  The specification states under 4.1.1- "jackscrews with female typeends, standoffs threaded, spacing (NSN: 5340-01-522-1658)".  A picture of the9-pin connector is posted to the e-commerce site.2. On page 1 of the drawing, note 4.1.3 indicates that the cable should exittoward the bottom of the radio. It appears that the Harris version of the C-600connector exits toward the bottom which would cause interference. Can weassume that Note 4.1.3 is in error?Answer: Paragraph 4.1.3 on Page 1 of the drawing on the e-commerce sitestating "Cable shall be designed to flow towards the bottom of the radio, notthe top, after connector "B" is connected to the radio" is the requirement.Thisis not an error.3. How many cables are currently connecting the radio to the TOCNET system?What are the part numbers for those cables?Answer: One cable currently connects the radio to the TOCNET System.  It is theSPAWAR W5007-1 Cable.  There is not a commercial part number for thatcable.  The interface to the existing cable is via the DB-9/DE-9 connector. TheSPAWAR W5007-1 cable will be connected to the cable assembly procuredunder this solicitation.  The Harris part number for the cable assembly beingprocured under this solicitation is 12041-72320-A18.4. Will vendors that offer a 32pin connector with dimensions greater than thosespecified in section 2.2.2 on page 1 of the drawing pass the technicalevaluation?Answer: Vendors will be evaluated on their compliance with the specifieddrawing, as well as, the function of their cable.Posted picture of 9-pin connector-24 September 2008N65236-08-R-0210-0002- 23 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions, update drawing for rev2 and provide clarification for other issues.Questions:1)The end "A" connector described on the drawing specification, para. 4.1.1,states a DB-9F, which is a 25-pin connector. The required 9-pin connectorshould be a DE-9S or DE-9P.Response: This was a typo.  Paragraph 4.1.1 should state DE-9F ( where F isfor Female). We need the 9-pin connector.  See http://www.nullmodem.com/DB-9.htm.  The "DB-9F" is not a 25 pin connector.  It is the Government'sunderstanding that the 9 stands for the number of pins.2)The solicitation spec and para. 4.1.1 of the drawing both state jackscrewswithfemale type ends while the drawing shows jack posts.Response: The drawing shows jackscrews with a female type (as stated in thespecs and para. 4.1.1).  Jack posts are not required.3)The specification states that the cable shall flow toward the bottom of theradio, yet the drawing spec shows pin 29 of the 32-pin connector located in away that would cause the cable to flow toward the top of the radio, since pin29is next to the connector key which is toward the top of the radio.Response:  The connector on our drawing should show pins 29 and 32 locatednext to the connector key.4) Please provide a cable assembly in order to create a schematic.Response: The Government does not have a cable assembly available.  This isthe first time these assemblies have been purchased.  We currently haveradios in theater without the appropriate cable.5)Please provide Ohmmeter readings for the pins.Response: Please contact the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) forOhmeter readings of the radio. The radio is a type 1 encrypted device.SPAWAR does not have the authority to release proprietary data about theradios.6) The gauge size of the cable used is 28 gauge.  Can you please advise why20 gauge is being specified?Response: The 20 gauge is correct.  For this cable, the government requires 20gauge cable.7) Do we have a part number for the cable.Response: No.8) What is the purpose of the contract number listed on bottom right of thecable specs documentResponse:  Disregard.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Emergency and Environmental Health Services (EEHS) contemplates award of an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract on or about May 1, 2008.  The contemplated contract will have a one-year base period and four, one-year options.  The total estimated ceiling price is $50 Million (approximately $10 Million per year).  Individual task orders may be either firm-fixed-price (FFP) or cost plus fixed fee (CPFF).  The attached draft statement of work describes the requirement in detail.  Included with the draft statement of work are the evaluation criteria and sample task order projects representative of the organization?s anticipated requirements.  Such samples should not be considered a comprehensive representation of all requirements.
1. Capability Statement:  Interested offerors are requested to submit a capability statement to the contracting officer Mr. Lionel (Lee) Nadeau, CDC Procurement and Grants Office, via e-mail at lnadeau@cdc.gov no later than January 25, 2007.  The capability statement should, as a minimum, address the following topics:

a.	Describe your organization?s experiences which relate to the statement of work occurring during the previous three years from the date of this synopsis.  Briefly explain the relationship to the draft statement of work. The attached project samples may also be considered for purposes of identifying and describing relevant experience.  Identify the period of contract performance and dollar value of the contract for the experiences submitted.
b.	Describe the breadth and scope of technical expertise and experience relative to the 12 primary tasks identified in paragraph C of the draft statement of work.
c.	Describe your organization?s capacity to support the diverse needs described in the draft statement of work.  What specific resources does your organization have available to support the requirement?  Describe the depth and breadth of the personnel expertise within your organization as related to the requirements described in the draft statement of work.
d.	Explain your organization?s ability to quickly identify appropriate technical personnel that may not be available from within your organization.  If possible, provide specific examples of successful accomplishments that demonstrate timely responses to provide technical personnel outside your organization upon short notice.  

Respondents are cautioned that ?standard? marketing brochures may not provide sufficient and specific information to enable the government to evaluate an offeror?s capabilities relative to the contemplated requirement (as reflected in the draft statement of work) and thus offerors should tailor the capability statement accordingly.  The capability statement is limited to 10 pages.  

2. Comments to Draft Statement of Work and Evaluation Criteria:  in addition to submitting a capability statement, offerors are invited to submit comments to the draft statement of work and evaluation criteria.  Due to time constraints and limited resources, the government does not  intend to respond to specific questions at this time but will consider comments and questions received in developing the final statement of work and evaluation criteria.

3. Business Size Status: The government will evaluate responses to this sources sought synopsis to determine the acquisition strategy (e.g. full and open competition versus a set aside).  Accordingly, offerors are requested to indicate their business size status relative to the NAICS code 541690 $6.5 Million and indicate any other applicable socio-economic business subcategory status (e.g. HUBZone, Small Disadvantage Business etc.).

Offerors? responses should be divided into three, distinct sections as follows:  1. Capability Statement; 2. Comments to Draft Statement of Work (as applicable); 3.  Business Size status.  

This sources sought synopsis does not obligate the government and is submitted as market research for acquisition planning purposes.  Offerors responding to this synopsis do so voluntarily and assume all costs incurred in preparing and submitting such response.  This synopsis is not a solicitation and therefore formal proposals are neither requested nor required.  Thus the CDC will reject any such proposals received in response to this sources sought synopsis.

<DESC>This modification accomplishes the following actions:
Provides a draft Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause for comment (separate attachment).  

Replies to the following questions received to date:

1. Is there an incumbent contractor?   Reply:  No.

2. Is this procurement planned to be a single contract with one company or will multiple contracts be awarded?     Reply:  Whether or not the government will make a single or multiple award will be determined, in part, based upon the responses received to the sources sought synopsis among other considerations.

3. Capability Statement Response: Please distinguish between information sought from offerors under 1a (organization's experience relative to the scope of work) and 1b (breadth and scope of technical expertise and experience relative to the scope of work).

Background The Rural Development area within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is the lead federal entity in rural economic and community development. Rural Development accomplishes its mission by providing assistance to rural America through a network of 47 state offices and numerous other field office locations covering 50 states, plus the Pacific Trust Territories, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Rural Development&rsquo;s headquarters is located in Washington, District of Columbia, with additional operations in St. Louis, Missouri. Synopsis USDA Rural Development (Agency) intends to obtain technical support services to provide maintenance support and enhancement development to one of its official accounting and financial management systems - Automated Multi-housing Accounting System (AMAS). The Agency, as part of supporting its overall role in providing agricultural credit and rural development assistance for the Multiple Family Housing (MFH) loan and grant program, has initiated activities to develop and enhance Agency information management. The continued shift from internal Agency automated systems used by USDA employees to a combination of internal, intranet and internet systems serving our varied customers mandates improved and responsive automation support. The AMAS loan portfolio contains approximately 21,000 loans with an outstanding principal balance in excess of $11.8 billion. AMAS currently consists of about 400 COBOL (600,000 lines of code) programs and 9 subsystems. The on-line system is written primarily in ADS-0 with some usage of DC-COBOL, and is made up of about 300 maps and dialogs. There are approximately 300 Job Control Language (JCL) members. Structured programming techniques have been used. The choice of development tool set and architecture will be determined by the Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Technical Representative (COTR) using the suite of tools approved by the Agency. The various automated components, which support the Agency loan programs, are at different stages of development effort in an attempt to meet E-File/GPEA mandates. The architecture of these components is evolving from a pure block-mode, mainframe environment to one of web-enabled intranet, extranet, and internet capabilities interfacing with some legacy processes. Common processes are being shared between programs where feasible to reduce maintenance overhead. All new development is aimed at re-usability among programs. Rural Development requires software maintenance and enhancement support for AMAS. This may include supporting documentation modifications and/or improvements, designing and/or developing software maintenance/enhancements, testing, supporting data base changes, and supporting any new technologies that are introduced. Various requests for data occur sporadically through the year, coming from Office of Inspector General (OIG), General Accounting Office (GAO), or Congressional requests. These requests must also be fulfilled as part of the work duties assigned. Additionally, the Agency direct loan and grant program&rsquo;s automated components must comply with OMB Circular A-129 performance goals, the Treasury Financial Manual, Circular A-123 guidance for internal control systems, Circular A-127 guidance for financial management systems, and Circular A-130, guidance for security requirements. Consideration must also be given to the JFMIP Government-Wide systems automation requirements and the E-File/GPEA initiatives. Acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items procedures. Full and Open competition will be exercised. The Government intends to award a single contract to the offeror who provides the best value to the Government. The contract will be for one (1) base year with four (4) option years to be exercised by the Government if found to be in its best interest. The approximate solicitation release date is May 27, 2008. The solicitation will be available and distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities website: http://www.fbo.gov . All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation and any amendments, will be distributed solely through the website listed. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. Offerors must obtain a DUNS number and register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov ) in order to transact business with USDA. Inquiries will only be accepted by email to the Point of Contact listed below. Interested parties shall submit proposals containing relevant pricing and service information as specified in the solicitation. Proposals must be received by 2:00 pm ET on June 13, 2008, and should be submitted electronically as instructed in the solicitation.</p>
